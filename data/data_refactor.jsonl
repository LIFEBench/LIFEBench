The stats are not all *that*\n>\tclearly behind firearms - the protection factor does not\n>\tstrongly outweigh the mindless mayhem factor.

That may be an error, but enough\n>\tactive voters believe in that course. \n>\n\nIf this were not true in practice, then certain unethical politicians would\nnot be passing gun control laws.  Politicians are generally whores to public\nopinion.  This does NOT mean the the public is either well informed or correct.\nAs for the stats,  anyone can support anything with the right stats.

Further, per-\nsons defending themselves from aggression by using a\ngun fare better than those who resist vicimization by\nsome other means, or who offer no resistance at all.\nStatistics available from the FBI and other agencies\nalso show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be\nused by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat\nthan to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times\nmore likely to be used to defend against a criminal\nthreat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times\nmore likely to defend against criminal threat than to be\nused to commit suicide.\n\nIt is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can\nbe proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has\nto consider carefully what questions were asked by\nthose gathering the data before one can draw an accu-\nrate conclusion from them.\n\nD.F.

{"id": 112, "category": "refactor", "type": "Professionalization", "lang": "en", "task": "[Instruction] You are given a question: \nHow to choose between several constraints for a SAT task using quality metric?\n<p>I'm trying to solve a constraint programming problem using a SAT solver. I have set of constraints in the form of propositional logic statements, which are converted to CNF using Tseitin transformation. A number of inputs are fixed and pretty large - up to ~30k. A number of constraints can be ~200k.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Right now, I have to choose between several constraint candidates which will be added to the CNF formula. All of them have some <code>quality</code> parameter - basically, a candidate should not remove too many feasible solutions from a search space. I can choose between smaller rules (a few boolean operators like AND, OR and no more than 10 inputs), but it is just impossible for the larger constraints (dozens of operators and ~100 inputs), there is no way to predict the quality of solution in that case. So, I ended up with the idea of a tool, which will automatically choose the best option for me.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, I have the basic rule:&#xA;$$\\neg(A \\wedge B \\wedge(C \\vee D \\vee E))1)$$&#xA;For this rules, I have two corresponding additional rules and I have to choose one of them:&#xA;$$\\neg(A \\wedge B) \\wedge blah2)$$&#xA;$$\\neg (C \\vee D \\vee E) \\wedge blah3)$$&#xA;The <code>(2)</code> formula is the best for me - it removes lesser number of solutions. <code>blah</code> is not relevant to my question, but it always appears inside candidates.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I have tried already:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Use Espresso logic minimization tool. I input all candidates at ones and hope to get the minimal representation. It kind of works, but the tool ignores a <code>quality</code> metric - the result is too constraining for my problem. Too many possible solutions are prohibited. In addition, my problem is far too big for Espresso and I have to use it in incremental manner. I assume that is an issue too - Espresso does not see the whole picture at ones.</li>&#xA;<li><h1>SAT solvers or model counting. The idea is the following - estimate a number of possible solutions under some basic constraints. I can add one of the candidates, estimate a number of possible solutions again, remove it and run such a procedure for each candidate. Eventually, I can choose one with the largest number of legal solutions. It seems to be working, however, it is too slow with real cases - exact counter freezes forever, approximate counter concludes that there are infinite number of solutions.</h1></li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would like to brainstorm that problem - maybe someone can propose interesting formulation/approaches for this task? May it can be formulated as ILP task somehow?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>UPDATE:&#xA;I am given a geometry problem - i have a rectangular tile that should be filled with a set of various objects. Some configurations of objects are prohibited (it does not matter why). Each rule is populated in every applicable point of a tile:&#xA;<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wbv7o.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\">&#xA;$$\\psi = \\neg (A_1 \\wedge B_1 \\wedge C_1) \\wedge \\neg (A_2 \\wedge B_2 \\wedge C_2)$$</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Blue bold lines are tile's borders. Such configuration of objects is prohibited:&#xA;$$ \\neg (A \\wedge B \\wedge C) 4)$$&#xA;This fact is represented as a set of clauses.&#xA;$\\psi$ forms a SAT task. You can think of it like \"SAT, find me a tile which does not have any of these prohibited configurations\". And this is my <code>core</code> formula. The same rule in different points of tile forms an identical set of clauses, but over different variables, e.g. $A_1, B_1, C_1$ and $A_2, B_2, C_2$ in the formula above - one rule forbids a set of 3 objects in 2 different points.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>At the same time, such rules can be partially outside a tile (pay attention to the right side border). The object outside is transparent:&#xA;<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JbMNy.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is prohibited too. The issue is that SAT solver does not know anything about world outside a tile, there is literally nothing out there. However, I still need to capture such configurations.

A number of constraints can be ~200k.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Right now, I have to choose between several constraint candidates which will be added to the CNF formula. All of them have some <code>quality</code> parameter - basically, a candidate should not remove too many feasible solutions from a search space. I can choose between smaller rules (a few boolean operators like AND, OR and no more than 10 inputs), but it is just impossible for the larger constraints (dozens of operators and ~100 inputs), there is no way to predict the quality of solution in that case. So, I ended up with the idea of a tool, which will automatically choose the best option for me.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, I have the basic rule:&#xA;$$\\neg(A \\wedge B \\wedge(C \\vee D \\vee E))1)$$&#xA;For this rules, I have two corresponding additional rules and I have to choose one of them:&#xA;$$\\neg(A \\wedge B) \\wedge blah2)$$&#xA;$$\\neg (C \\vee D \\vee E) \\wedge blah3)$$&#xA;The <code>(2)</code> formula is the best for me - it removes lesser number of solutions. <code>blah</code> is not relevant to my question, but it always appears inside candidates.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I have tried already:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Use Espresso logic minimization tool. I input all candidates at ones and hope to get the minimal representation. It kind of works, but the tool ignores a <code>quality</code> metric - the result is too constraining for my problem. Too many possible solutions are prohibited. In addition, my problem is far too big for Espresso and I have to use it in incremental manner. I assume that is an issue too - Espresso does not see the whole picture at ones.</li>&#xA;<li><h1>SAT solvers or model counting. The idea is the following - estimate a number of possible solutions under some basic constraints. I can add one of the candidates, estimate a number of possible solutions again, remove it and run such a procedure for each candidate. Eventually, I can choose one with the largest number of legal solutions. It seems to be working, however, it is too slow with real cases - exact counter freezes forever, approximate counter concludes that there are infinite number of solutions.</h1></li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would like to brainstorm that problem - maybe someone can propose interesting formulation/approaches for this task? May it can be formulated as ILP task somehow?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>UPDATE:&#xA;I am given a geometry problem - i have a rectangular tile that should be filled with a set of various objects. Some configurations of objects are prohibited (it does not matter why). Each rule is populated in every applicable point of a tile:&#xA;<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wbv7o.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\">&#xA;$$\\psi = \\neg (A_1 \\wedge B_1 \\wedge C_1) \\wedge \\neg (A_2 \\wedge B_2 \\wedge C_2)$$</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Blue bold lines are tile's borders. Such configuration of objects is prohibited:&#xA;$$ \\neg (A \\wedge B \\wedge C) 4)$$&#xA;This fact is represented as a set of clauses.&#xA;$\\psi$ forms a SAT task. You can think of it like \"SAT, find me a tile which does not have any of these prohibited configurations\". And this is my <code>core</code> formula. The same rule in different points of tile forms an identical set of clauses, but over different variables, e.g. $A_1, B_1, C_1$ and $A_2, B_2, C_2$ in the formula above - one rule forbids a set of 3 objects in 2 different points.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>At the same time, such rules can be partially outside a tile (pay attention to the right side border). The object outside is transparent:&#xA;<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JbMNy.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is prohibited too. The issue is that SAT solver does not know anything about world outside a tile, there is literally nothing out there. However, I still need to capture such configurations. I take each core rule and split it with boundary:&#xA;<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/a9obU.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\">&#xA;$$\\neg(A \\wedge boundary) 5)$$&#xA;$$\\neg(A \\wedge C \\wedge boundary) 6)$$</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Over the whole tile it looks like this:&#xA;<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PZYVC.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If we choose 5) rule, we will prohibit all obects $A$ near the boundary:&#xA;$$\\psi = \\neg (A_1 \\wedge boundary) \\wedge \\neg (A_2 \\wedge boundary) \\wedge \\neg (A_3 \\wedge boundary) \\wedge \\neg (A_4 \\wedge boundary)$$</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, we can choose 6) rule:&#xA;$$\\psi = \\neg (A_1 \\wedge A_2 \\wedge boundary) \\wedge \\neg (A_2 \\wedge A_3 \\wedge boundary) \\wedge \\neg (A_3 \\wedge A_4 \\wedge boundary)$$&#xA;This option is much better - it prohibits 2) rule near the boundary already and at the same time it allows to place single $A$ object near the boundary.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My questions:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>How can I choose between various candidates? </li>&#xA;<li>Which tools can me help? #SAT, MaxSAT, MIP?</li>&#xA;<li>Which metric can I use to optimise a set of rules?</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;"}

The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scrambling\ncompared with 16 in DES.\n\n\tIn addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his \n\tor her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key \n\tplain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be \n\nK is the session key shared by the sender and receiver.  Any method\n(e.g., public key) can be used to establish the session key.  In the\nAT&T telephone security devices, which will have the new chip, the key\nis negotiated using a public-key protocol.\n \n\tencrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, \n\tand the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part \n\tmessage which will then be encrypted under the system key SK \n\tproducing\n\n\t     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\n\nMy understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the\n\"family key\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by\nlaw enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I\nwill also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.\n\n        The unit key \n\twill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \n\tand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \n\nThe unit key, also called the \"chip key,\" is generated from the\nserial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks\nderived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.\nCompute the 64-bit block \n\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] \n\n(Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with\ntwo keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.\n(I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that\nthey're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are\nconcatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and\nthe next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.\n\n\tauthorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be \n\tdecided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that \n\tthey will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they \n\tmust be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. \n\nMarty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions.\nPlease pass them to me along with your reasons.  In addition to Marty's\ncriteria, I would add that the agencies must have an established record\nof being able to safeguard highly sensitive information.  Some suggestions\nI've received so far include SRI, Rand, Mitre, the national labs (Sandia,\nLANL, Los Alamos), Treasury, GAO.\n\n\tWhen a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law \n\tenforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information \n\tflowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that \n\tthey may do this constantly on all links, with or without a \n\tcourt order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links \n\tover which a message will flow.] \n\nMy understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it\nwill be operated by the FBI.  The service provider will isolate the\ncommunications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass through\nthe decode box, which will have been keyed with K.\n\n\tfor \"the wiretap authorizations.\" When Levy asked for\n\tthe details so he could review the cases as required by\n\tlaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned\n\tover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did notcomply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: No single person or authority should have the power toauthorize wiretaps\n\nNo single person does, at least for FBI taps.  After completing a mound\nof paperwork, an agent must get the approval of several people on a chain\nthat includes FBI legal counsel before the request is even taken to the\nAttorney General for final approval.\n\nDorothy Denning\n\n[Requirement] Rewrite the email in an informal and engaging style.

If you think\nsomething doesn't make sense, it's almost certainly because you don't\nunderstand their goals.\n\n\t\t--Steve Bellovin\n\n-----\n\nDate: Sun, 18 Apr 93 07:56:39 EDT\nFrom: denning@cs.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning)\nSubject: Re:  Clipper Chip\nTo: (a long list of folks)\n\nI was also briefed by the NSA and FBI, so let me add a few comments to\nMarty's message:\n\n        The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in \n\nThe algorithm operates on 64-bit blocks (like DES) and the chip supports\nall 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scrambling\ncompared with 16 in DES.\n\n\tIn addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his \n\tor her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key \n\tplain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be \n\nK is the session key shared by the sender and receiver.  Any method\n(e.g., public key) can be used to establish the session key.  In the\nAT&T telephone security devices, which will have the new chip, the key\nis negotiated using a public-key protocol.\n \n\tencrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, \n\tand the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part \n\tmessage which will then be encrypted under the system key SK \n\tproducing\n\n\t     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\n\nMy understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the\n\"family key\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by\nlaw enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I\nwill also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.\n\n        The unit key \n\twill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \n\tand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \n\nThe unit key, also called the \"chip key,\" is generated from the\nserial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks\nderived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.\nCompute the 64-bit block \n\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] \n\n(Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with\ntwo keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.\n(I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that\nthey're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are\nconcatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and\nthe next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.\n\n\tauthorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be \n\tdecided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that \n\tthey will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they \n\tmust be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. \n\nMarty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions.\nPlease pass them to me along with your reasons.  In addition to Marty's\ncriteria, I would add that the agencies must have an established record\nof being able to safeguard highly sensitive information.  Some suggestions\nI've received so far include SRI, Rand, Mitre, the national labs (Sandia,\nLANL, Los Alamos), Treasury, GAO.\n\n\tWhen a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law \n\tenforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information \n\tflowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that \n\tthey may do this constantly on all links, with or without a \n\tcourt order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links \n\tover which a message will flow.] \n\nMy understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it\nwill be operated by the FBI.  The service provider will isolate the\ncommunications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass through\nthe decode box, which will have been keyed with K.\n\n\tfor \"the wiretap authorizations.\" When Levy asked for\n\tthe details so he could review the cases as required by\n\tlaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned\n\tover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did notcomply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: No single person or authority should have the power toauthorize wiretaps\n\nNo single person does, at least for FBI taps.  After completing a mound\nof paperwork, an agent must get the approval of several people on a chain\nthat includes FBI legal counsel before the request is even taken to the\nAttorney General for final approval.\n\nDorothy Denning"}

I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on\nThursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable\ntime talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I\nattended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.  \nThe document below is the result of that effort. \n\nDorothy Denning\n---------------\n\n                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY\n\n                               Dorothy Denning\n\n                                April 19, 1993\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOn April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring\ntogether the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program\nto provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of\nlaw enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\nchip called the \"Clipper Chip\" together with a split-key approach to\nescrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\nboth are needed to reconstruct a key.\n\n\nCHIP STRUCTURE\n\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption\nalgorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared\nwith 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16\nfor the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is\n16 Mbits a second.\n\nEach chip includes the following components:\n\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n   N, a 30-bit serial number\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\n\n\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\n\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\nconversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with\nthe device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can\nbe used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then\nfed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:\n\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  \n\nThe law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted\nunder the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all\nencrypted under the family key F.\n\n\nCHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\n\nAll Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer\ninformation facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\na laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\nare programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\nMikotronx.\n\nAt the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\nescrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1\ninto the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values\nserve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.\n\nTo generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\nfirst padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\nS1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\n64-bit block R1:\n\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\nSimilarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\nN3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \n\n        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\nR1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\nfirst 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\nrest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\nare the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\nagencies.\n\nAs a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\nwritten onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\nfile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\nU1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\ndisk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\n2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.\nAfter the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the\nvault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional\nassurance that no information is left behind.\n \nThe protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\nroom instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\nand the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\nthe escrow agencies.\n\nThe escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not\nbe the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or\nboth may be independent from the government.\n\n\nLAW ENFORCEMENT USE\n\nWhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\nwill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\naccess to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in\nplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with\nClipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the\nfamily key F.

I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on\nThursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable\ntime talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I\nattended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.  \nThe document below is the result of that effort. \n\nDorothy Denning\n---------------\n\n                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY\n\n                               Dorothy Denning\n\n                                April 19, 1993\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOn April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring\ntogether the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program\nto provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of\nlaw enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\nchip called the \"Clipper Chip\" together with a split-key approach to\nescrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\nboth are needed to reconstruct a key.\n\n\nCHIP STRUCTURE\n\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption\nalgorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared\nwith 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16\nfor the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is\n16 Mbits a second.\n\nEach chip includes the following components:\n\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n   N, a 30-bit serial number\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\n\n\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\n\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\nconversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with\nthe device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can\nbe used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then\nfed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:\n\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  \n\nThe law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted\nunder the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all\nencrypted under the family key F.\n\n\nCHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\n\nAll Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer\ninformation facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\na laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\nare programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\nMikotronx.\n\nAt the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\nescrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1\ninto the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values\nserve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.\n\nTo generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\nfirst padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\nS1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\n64-bit block R1:\n\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\nSimilarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\nN3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \n\n        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\nR1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\nfirst 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\nrest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\nare the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\nagencies.\n\nAs a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\nwritten onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\nfile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\nU1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\ndisk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\n2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.\nAfter the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the\nvault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional\nassurance that no information is left behind.\n \nThe protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\nroom instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\nand the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\nthe escrow agencies.\n\nThe escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not\nbe the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or\nboth may be independent from the government.\n\n\nLAW ENFORCEMENT USE\n\nWhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\nwill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\naccess to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in\nplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with\nClipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the\nfamily key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a\nwarrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow\nagents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce\nthe unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.\nFinally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished\nthrough a special black box decoder operated by the FBI.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.  All information is based on\ninformation provided by NSA, NIST, and the FBI.  Permission to\ndistribute this document is granted."}

Azeri views on this dispute have\n[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me\n[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the\n[AR] origins of the conflict.\n\nDuring the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,\na small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.\n\nThe following should be interesting. \n\n[AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and\n[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,\n[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian\n[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,\n[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,\n[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait\n[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThis not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an\nindependent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September\n1991, page 28, we read:\n\n \"By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in\n  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party\n  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to\n  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were\n  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 \n  Armenian inhabitants fled the city...\"\n\n  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in\n  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away.\"\n\nIn this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian \npogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!\n\n[AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that\n[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule\n[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of \"divide and\n[AR] rule.\"  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year\n[AR] history of the conflict.\n\nIt is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the\nperpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.\n \n[AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in\n[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an\n[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in\n[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian\n[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.\n\nIncorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an\nagreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-\nKarabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.\n \n[AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri\n[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and\n[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the\n[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly\n[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly\n[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.\n \nIt's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the \nArmenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian\nculture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The\nAzeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and\nplay dead. \n\n[AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country\n[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the\n[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish\n[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government\n[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and\n[AR] possessions?\n\nThe Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they\nattempted to deprive Armenians of \"lands, homes, and possessions\".\n \n[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.\n[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian\n[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,\n[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.\n\nTrue, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!\n \n[AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.\n[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western\n[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security\n[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led\n[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed\n[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the\n[AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.\n[AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.\n\nWestern interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into\nthis conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of \nEurope (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!\nDr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would\nhave us believe.\n \n[AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an\n[AR]\"Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.\"  The truth is that the Armenians\n[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.\n\nIncorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish\nclaim. \n\nArmenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as \"Artsakh\", which \ncomes from the Urartian term \"Urtekhe-Urtekhini\". NO Azeris yet! \n\nAncient Greeks referred to Artsakh as \"Orkhistena\". NO Azeris yet!\n\nIn the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid\nArmenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!\n\nFrom the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom\nof Ervan. NO Azeris yet!\n\nArtsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or \nArtsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\n\nAfter Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 \nA.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\n\nEnd of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the \nAranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!\n\nBy the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!\n\nEmperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen \"To\nArmenia\". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!\n\nIn the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area\nwas stated as 11,000.\n\nIt was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central\nAsia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence\nin the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!\n\nIn 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some \nMuslims in Karabakh!\n\nIn 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188\npriests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian\npercentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --\nassuming no Kurds!\n\nConsider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:\n\n \"The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the\n  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings\n  to the brother people.

In addition to such absurdity,\nAzeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their\nminorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other\nnationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.\n\n[AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the\n[AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the\n[AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual\n[AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.

Azeri views on this dispute have\n[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me\n[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the\n[AR] origins of the conflict.\n\nDuring the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,\na small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.\n\nThe following should be interesting. \n\n[AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and\n[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,\n[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian\n[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,\n[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,\n[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait\n[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThis not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an\nindependent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September\n1991, page 28, we read:\n\n \"By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in\n  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party\n  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to\n  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were\n  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 \n  Armenian inhabitants fled the city...\"\n\n  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in\n  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away.\"\n\nIn this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian \npogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!\n\n[AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that\n[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule\n[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of \"divide and\n[AR] rule.\"  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year\n[AR] history of the conflict.\n\nIt is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the\nperpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.\n \n[AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in\n[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an\n[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in\n[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian\n[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.\n\nIncorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an\nagreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-\nKarabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.\n \n[AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri\n[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and\n[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the\n[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly\n[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly\n[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.\n \nIt's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the \nArmenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian\nculture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The\nAzeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and\nplay dead. \n\n[AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country\n[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the\n[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish\n[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government\n[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and\n[AR] possessions?\n\nThe Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they\nattempted to deprive Armenians of \"lands, homes, and possessions\".\n \n[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.\n[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian\n[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,\n[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.\n\nTrue, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!\n \n[AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.\n[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western\n[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security\n[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led\n[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed\n[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the\n[AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.\n[AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.\n\nWestern interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into\nthis conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of \nEurope (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!\nDr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would\nhave us believe.\n \n[AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an\n[AR]\"Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.\"  The truth is that the Armenians\n[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.\n\nIncorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish\nclaim. \n\nArmenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as \"Artsakh\", which \ncomes from the Urartian term \"Urtekhe-Urtekhini\". NO Azeris yet! \n\nAncient Greeks referred to Artsakh as \"Orkhistena\". NO Azeris yet!\n\nIn the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid\nArmenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!\n\nFrom the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom\nof Ervan. NO Azeris yet!\n\nArtsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or \nArtsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\n\nAfter Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 \nA.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\n\nEnd of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the \nAranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!\n\nBy the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!\n\nEmperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen \"To\nArmenia\". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!\n\nIn the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area\nwas stated as 11,000.\n\nIt was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central\nAsia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence\nin the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!\n\nIn 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some \nMuslims in Karabakh!\n\nIn 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188\npriests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian\npercentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --\nassuming no Kurds!\n\nConsider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:\n\n \"The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the\n  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings\n  to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled.

The Bobbs-Merrill\nCompany, Indianapolis (1926). (305 pages). \n(Memoirs of an Armenian officer who participated in the genocide of 2.5 \n million Muslim people)\n\n\"Foreword:\"\n\n\"For example, we were camped one night in a half-ruined Tartar mosque, \n the most habitable building of a destroyed village, near the border \n of Persia and Russian Armenia. During the course of evening I asked \n Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and \n the cause of its destruction. In his matter of fact way he replied, Yes, \n I assisted in its sack and destruction, and witnessed the slaying of \n those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins.\" \n\np. 202 (first and second paragraphs).\n\n\"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as \n ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work \n of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. \n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \n completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \n Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for \n howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the \n scattered bones of the dead.\" \n\np. 15 (second paragraph).\n\n\"The Tartars were, for the most part, poor. Some of them lived in villages \n and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of \n their nomadic forefathers. They drove their flocks and herds from valley \n to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following \n the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. They ranged from the salt \n desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains. \n Even the village Tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized.\"\n\n\"I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars, and, while \n holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and\n treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all\n Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars, far from proving\n a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified\n an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility.\"\n\np. 20 (second paragraph).\n\n\"Our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the Tartar\n section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors\n were barred, for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great \n fear. Our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they\n smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last\n Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night, I cowered at home in terror,\n unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and\n the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished.\"\n\np. 109 (second paragraph).\n\n\"As things were, the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative\n experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself\n incompetent to rule by legitimate means.\n\n The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and\n outside the law. When they became a legally instituted, recognized governing\n body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to \n do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their \n fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days.\n\n The outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was,\n as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking\n the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and\n condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method \n of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the\n condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back\n of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of\n those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became\n a common way of paying debts.\"\n\np. 203 (first paragraph).\n\n\"A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the\n point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock \n and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him\n sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body, and, raising\n it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in Russian, 'Slodkey!\n Slodkey!' (Sweet.)\"\n\np. 203 (second paragraph).\n\n\"One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the \n ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about\n it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children.\n The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed\n sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and\n other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the\n dead.\"\n\np. 204 (first paragraph).\n\n\"I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of\n a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make\n my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy\n that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of\n a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a\n Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her\n throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a\n year old.\"\n\np. 118.\n\n\"Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart\n jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging\n them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the\n carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms.\n Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they\n sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot.\n\n Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading\n oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians \n concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and\n scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety.\n\n This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by \n barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene....\n That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted\n and completely destroyed.\"\n\np. 192.\n\n\"Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the\n retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced.... They entered\n into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores\n that had been left by the Turks.\"\n\np. 193.\n\n\"Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars, Kurds and Turks. Their villages\n were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country.\"\n\np. 195.\n\n\"The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order\n of diminishing intensity: Tartars, Kurds and Russians.\" \n\np. 218. (First and second paragraphs)\n\n\"Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villages...We Armenians \n did not spare the Tartars....If persisted in, the slaughtering of prisoners, \n the looting, and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace \n actions expected and accepted as a matter of course.\n\n I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground,\n in numbers, like the fallen leaves in a forest. They had been as helpless\n and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the\n heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands,\n and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must, with\n their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself.\"\n\np. 133 (first paragraph)\n\n\"In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who\n had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians\n abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of\n these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the\n brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. Some,\n mercifully, were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method\n employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after\n crowding the hut with Turks, set fire to the straw.\"\n\np. 19 (first paragraph)\n\n\"The Tartar section of the town no longer existed, except as a pile of\n ruins. It had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered. The same \n fate befell the Tartar section of Khankandi.\"\n\np. 22 (second paragraph)\n\n\"Many of our men had served in the Russian Army, and were trained soldiers.\n We Armenians were rich and possessed arms.

The Bobbs-Merrill\nCompany, Indianapolis (1926). (305 pages). \n(Memoirs of an Armenian officer who participated in the genocide of 2.5 \n million Muslim people)\n\n\"Foreword:\"\n\n\"For example, we were camped one night in a half-ruined Tartar mosque, \n the most habitable building of a destroyed village, near the border \n of Persia and Russian Armenia. During the course of evening I asked \n Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and \n the cause of its destruction. In his matter of fact way he replied, Yes, \n I assisted in its sack and destruction, and witnessed the slaying of \n those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins.\" \n\np. 202 (first and second paragraphs).\n\n\"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as \n ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work \n of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. \n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \n completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \n Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for \n howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the \n scattered bones of the dead.\" \n\np. 15 (second paragraph).\n\n\"The Tartars were, for the most part, poor. Some of them lived in villages \n and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of \n their nomadic forefathers. They drove their flocks and herds from valley \n to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following \n the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. They ranged from the salt \n desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains. \n Even the village Tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized.\"\n\n\"I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars, and, while \n holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and\n treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all\n Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars, far from proving\n a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified\n an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility.\"\n\np. 20 (second paragraph).\n\n\"Our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the Tartar\n section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors\n were barred, for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great \n fear. Our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they\n smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last\n Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night, I cowered at home in terror,\n unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and\n the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished.\"\n\np. 109 (second paragraph).\n\n\"As things were, the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative\n experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself\n incompetent to rule by legitimate means.\n\n The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and\n outside the law. When they became a legally instituted, recognized governing\n body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to \n do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their \n fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days.\n\n The outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was,\n as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking\n the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and\n condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method \n of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the\n condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back\n of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of\n those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became\n a common way of paying debts.\"\n\np. 203 (first paragraph).\n\n\"A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the\n point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock \n and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him\n sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body, and, raising\n it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in Russian, 'Slodkey!\n Slodkey!' (Sweet.)\"\n\np. 203 (second paragraph).\n\n\"One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the \n ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about\n it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children.\n The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed\n sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and\n other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the\n dead.\"\n\np. 204 (first paragraph).\n\n\"I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of\n a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make\n my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy\n that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of\n a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a\n Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her\n throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a\n year old.\"\n\np. 118.\n\n\"Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart\n jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging\n them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the\n carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms.\n Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they\n sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot.\n\n Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading\n oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians \n concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and\n scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety.\n\n This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by \n barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene....\n That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted\n and completely destroyed.\"\n\np. 192.\n\n\"Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the\n retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced.... They entered\n into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores\n that had been left by the Turks.\"\n\np. 193.\n\n\"Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars, Kurds and Turks. Their villages\n were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country.\"\n\np. 195.\n\n\"The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order\n of diminishing intensity: Tartars, Kurds and Russians.\" \n\np. 218. (First and second paragraphs)\n\n\"Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villages...We Armenians \n did not spare the Tartars....If persisted in, the slaughtering of prisoners, \n the looting, and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace \n actions expected and accepted as a matter of course.\n\n I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground,\n in numbers, like the fallen leaves in a forest. They had been as helpless\n and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the\n heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands,\n and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must, with\n their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself.\"\n\np. 133 (first paragraph)\n\n\"In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who\n had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians\n abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of\n these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the\n brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. Some,\n mercifully, were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method\n employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after\n crowding the hut with Turks, set fire to the straw.\"\n\np. 19 (first paragraph)\n\n\"The Tartar section of the town no longer existed, except as a pile of\n ruins. It had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered. The same \n fate befell the Tartar section of Khankandi.\"\n\np. 22 (second paragraph)\n\n\"Many of our men had served in the Russian Army, and were trained soldiers.\n We Armenians were rich and possessed arms. Tartars had never received\n military training. They were poor, and possessed few arms beyond knives.\n ...Shortly after the killing of the Tartars in our village, the revolution\n in Russia was suppressed.\"\n\np. 97 (third paragraph)\n\n\"Within a few years, following the beginning of the movement, an invisible\n government of Armenians by Armenians had been established in Turkish \n Armenia in armed opposition to the Turkish Government.

{"id": 136, "category": "refactor", "type": "Style Conversion", "lang": "en", "task": "[Instruction] You are given a email: \nSender: news@osuunx.ucc.okstate.edu (USENET News System)\nNntp-Posting-Host: vms.ocom.okstate.edu\nOrganization: OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\nDate: Fri, 30 Apr 1993 20:22:13 GMT\n\nI've sent Gordon R. my posts on protein, vitamin C and vitamin A prior to \nposting on internet as a professional courtesy.  Somehow I've managed to \ndelete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send \nit back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype it.\nSince digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all \nday for that PMS post), I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has \nthem).  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and \nMorgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to \npoint out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical \ncommunity.\n\nDiet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long \ntime.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've \nalready covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection.\nNow I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in \nthe U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).\n\nWhen vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as \nthe anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have \ndecided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C\n(which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is \nalso getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason).\nThe NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if \nvitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role in \nboth cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).\n\nVitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and \nbeta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-carotene \nis the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta-\ncarotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present\n(60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other \ntissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human \nadult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We \nare born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about \n30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they \nwere born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that \nof retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is \nnot going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient \nreserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of \nvitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet \nsurveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A\n(either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National \nResearch Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the \nRDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to \n7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations was \nkilled.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main \nreason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient \nreserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to \nmove away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move \ntowards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have \nsome very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely \nimportant during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that \nbattle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the \n1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the \ndietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the \n1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill \nthe reserves).\n\nWe know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a \nnormal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient \nreserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients.\nBut for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how \nmuch somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has \noverfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol \nlevel(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your \nliver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol).  The normal \nrange of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is \ndiagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation \nof Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level \nof vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to \nvitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative \napproach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in \nthis post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty \nof warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache, \nredness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain).\n\nI tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they \nhad better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear \nsigns that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient \nneeds the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you \nwill always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for \nPMS studies).\n\nBeta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will \nnever have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to \nretinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the \nliver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But \ntaking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to \nfill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% \nthat only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One \nother problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not \nconvert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the \nenxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of \nretinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will \ncause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A.\n\nNow what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body \nuses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be \nnailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde\n(retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the \nretinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses \nretinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells \nand the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes, \none of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the \ntitle of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play \na role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role \nis the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake \nof vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But \nretinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once \nit's formed, it's used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC \ngroup wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's.\n\nMost people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are \nhelping themselves.  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and \nthey are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do \nthemselves more harm than good.\n\nRetinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation.\nIn the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus \nproduction and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from \nentering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the \"first \nline\" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown \nto act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which \nstimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration \nand cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters \nare not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not \nnormally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process.\nThis is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials \nin progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene.\n\nChronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that \nvitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who \nwalks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be \nworked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already \nhas on it's list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my \ncourse at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic \nmedical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lectures.\n\nDark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night \nvision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The \nserum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver \nreserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have \ntrouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled \nout).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels \nwere measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below \n20ug/dl.\n\nAs more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of \nthe U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably \nsee a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low \nserum retinol levels.\n\nWhat do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts\nfrom their book:\n\nVitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for \ngrowth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for \nreproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie \nmalnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and \nmetabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid, \nwhich has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not \nin reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A \nstatus is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal \nrange for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are \nindicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater \nthan 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation \ntests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to \nperform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to \nvitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The \nbronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal \ntract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than \n7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts \nover 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation, \nerythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois\n(bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.  \n\nThey recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A \ndeficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol \nlevel is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in \nadults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule \nout a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical \nlab can't run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give \nthem the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity \nshould not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the \npatient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.\n\nBoth Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A.\nRecall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A.\nI don't suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to \nfill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the \nserum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the \nvitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a \ndemonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will \nprovide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status \nare good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more \nagressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But \nvitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could \nbecome pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human \nfetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is \n18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on \nthe human fetus.\n\nCould just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes \nbut the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use \nretinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it \nfull.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to \nprescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroup \njumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A \nsupplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I \nthink that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market \nbut require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general \npublic about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.\n\nMarty B.\n\n[Requirement] Rewrite the email in an informal and engaging style.

Somehow I've managed to \ndelete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send \nit back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype it.\nSince digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all \nday for that PMS post), I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has \nthem).  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and \nMorgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to \npoint out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical \ncommunity.\n\nDiet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long \ntime.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've \nalready covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection.\nNow I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in \nthe U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).\n\nWhen vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as \nthe anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have \ndecided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C\n(which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is \nalso getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason).\nThe NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if \nvitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role in \nboth cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).\n\nVitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and \nbeta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-carotene \nis the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta-\ncarotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present\n(60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other \ntissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human \nadult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We \nare born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about \n30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they \nwere born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that \nof retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is \nnot going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient \nreserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of \nvitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet \nsurveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A\n(either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National \nResearch Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the \nRDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to \n7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations was \nkilled.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main \nreason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient \nreserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to \nmove away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move \ntowards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have \nsome very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely \nimportant during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that \nbattle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the \n1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the \ndietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the \n1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill \nthe reserves).\n\nWe know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a \nnormal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).

This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \n (See also Map 1.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State \nare summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:\n\n\t\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State\n\tgoverned by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public\n\tpeace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;\n\tloyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental\n\ttenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\"\n\nFreedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing\nthe many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The\nfact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be\nattributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.\nThe first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.\nAlthough the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force\nonly temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.\n\nThe 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and\nthe right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution\nof 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing\nthe power of the Parliament and the government.\n\nThe First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the\noccupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was\nabolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the\noccupying forces.\n\nDuring the Independence War, the \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" held their\nfirst meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new\nTurkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish\nRepublic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new\nConstitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal \nbackbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a \nmulti-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by\nothers in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been\nbased on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national\nsovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.\n\n\"Major Principles of the Constitution\"\n\nThe constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic\nwithin the following principles:\n\n- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by \n  law;\n- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,\n  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;\n- The language of the State is Turkish;\n- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.\n  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;\n- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This\n  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;\n- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;\n- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the\n  Turkish nation;\n- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,\n  sex, or political beliefs;\n- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.\n\n\"Structure of the State\"\n\nIn accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the\nprinciple of \"division of power\" to create a balanced and self-controlled\nsystem. The power is divided into \"legislative power,\" \"executive power,\" and\n\"judicial power,\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each\nother (self-control).\n\n A. Legislative Power:\n\n The \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" is a parliament with one House, elected\n by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on\n behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:\n\n - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;\n - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;\n - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;\n - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;\n - to ratify international agreements;\n - to grant amnesty or pardons.\n\n Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral\n or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is\n divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is\n calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age\n of twenty-one can vote.\n\n Elections are supervised by the \"Supreme Council of Elections,\" which solves\n all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \"Board of Election\"\n runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the\n Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among \n independent judges.\n\n B. Executive Power:\n\n The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government\n as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:\n\n - to represent the State and the Country;\n - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;\n - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;\n - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;\n - to ratify laws and government decrees.\n \n The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven\n years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may \n call for a referendum.\n\n Executive power is exercised by the \"Council of Ministers,\" headed by the\n Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the\n members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval\n by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their\n program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)\n Ministers in the Council.\n\n Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent\n \"administrative\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or\n functions against any law.\n\n C. Judicial Power:\n\n Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can\n instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be \n discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the\n reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories\n of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:\n\n - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The \n   decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice\n   upon the appeal of the parties involved.\n - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime\n   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in\n   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.\n   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the\n   high administrative court.\n\n The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the\n \"Constitutional Court\" if they contradict the Constitution. If found\n contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.\n\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'(Ohanus Appressian - 1919)'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul.'

Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a \ntelegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in \nApril 21, 1915, \"thanking it for its services to Russia.\" The Armenian \nnewspaper Gochnak, published in the United States, also proudly \nreported in May 24, 1915 that \n\n\"only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered.\"\n\nSource: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918.\nUniversity of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles), 1967, p. 13.\n\n\"The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the\n area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\n of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \n (See also Map 1.

The latter was written with\n    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind\n    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).\n\n    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John\n    Snyder's USGS publication \"Map Projections--A Working Manual\", USGS\n    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32\n    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both\n    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a\n    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.\n\n    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,\n    \"An Album of Map Projections\", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This\n    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are\n    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.\n\n    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:\n    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National\n    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and\n    tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.\n\n    A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,\n    (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call\n    them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a\n    check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up\n    for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.\n\n    A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:\n\n\tR. Miller and F.

It\n(this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc\nVanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a\nvariety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific\nto RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.\n\nThis month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply\nwith the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy\nmanipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know\nwhat you think.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n----------\nNothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything\nother than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk\nto a real lawyer.\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n---------------------\n\n1)  What is RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using\n the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your\n electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who\n sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except\n the intended recipient.)\n\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\n\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\n to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or\n Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README\n file:\n\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\n\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\n RIPEM.\n\n The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will\n reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the\n humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the\n friend.\n\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents\n in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for\n info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and\n does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.\n\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\n rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\n how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\n\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\n\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\n\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\n\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\n Emacs.\n\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\n\n5)  What is RSA?\n\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\n you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your\n decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\n decrypt it.  (Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\n the DES key to the real message. (See \"What is DES?\")\n\n Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,\n the fingerprint of the message (See \"What is a fingerprint, like\n MD5?\") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can\n use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message\n must have come from the sender.\n\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\n invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in\n pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.\n\n6)  What is DES?\n\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\n\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\n recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\n\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\n corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future\n RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using\n multiple encryption with DES.\n\n7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?\n\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of\n encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\n\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\n\n8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?\n\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\n that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\n\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\n None of them provide perfect security.\n\n9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\n\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various\n characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in\n your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.\n This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the\n same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the\n same length, etc.\n\n10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\n\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\n\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\n\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\n RFC 1321.\n\n11)  What is PGP?\n\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\n\n Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\n\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\n   a direct network connection.\n\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of\n   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible\n   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with\n   PGP 2.0.)\n\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security\n   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.\n   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,\n   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims\n   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in\n   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original\n   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:\n\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \n   #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.

It\n(this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc\nVanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a\nvariety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific\nto RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.\n\nThis month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply\nwith the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy\nmanipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know\nwhat you think.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n----------\nNothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything\nother than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk\nto a real lawyer.\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n---------------------\n\n1)  What is RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using\n the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your\n electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who\n sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except\n the intended recipient.)\n\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\n\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\n to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or\n Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README\n file:\n\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\n\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\n RIPEM.\n\n The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will\n reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the\n humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the\n friend.\n\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents\n in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for\n info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and\n does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.\n\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\n rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\n how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\n\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\n\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\n\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\n\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\n Emacs.\n\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\n\n5)  What is RSA?\n\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\n you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your\n decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\n decrypt it.  (Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\n the DES key to the real message. (See \"What is DES?\")\n\n Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,\n the fingerprint of the message (See \"What is a fingerprint, like\n MD5?\") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can\n use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message\n must have come from the sender.\n\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\n invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in\n pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.\n\n6)  What is DES?\n\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\n\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\n recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\n\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\n corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future\n RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using\n multiple encryption with DES.\n\n7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?\n\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of\n encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\n\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\n\n8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?\n\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\n that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\n\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\n None of them provide perfect security.\n\n9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\n\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various\n characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in\n your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.\n This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the\n same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the\n same length, etc.\n\n10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\n\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\n\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\n\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\n RFC 1321.\n\n11)  What is PGP?\n\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\n\n Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\n\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\n   a direct network connection.\n\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of\n   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible\n   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with\n   PGP 2.0.)\n\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security\n   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.\n   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,\n   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims\n   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in\n   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original\n   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:\n\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \n   #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\n   #contraband.  \n\n - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\n   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites\n   in Europe and other places.\n\n Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\n\n Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export\n restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it\n shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents\n differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably\n seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in\n misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \"DISCLAIMER\")\n\n12)  What about RPEM?\n\n RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.

It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\n\n13)  What is MIME?\n\n MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\n described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\n comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely\n clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type\n application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I\n hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on\n the matter.\n\n14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\n\n You may wish to check the companion post \"ripem-attacks\" which\n discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and\n what procedures will minimize the risk.

As an Armenian I \nam partisan -- by definition. However, this does give me the license to lie, \ncover-up, or revise events under question as we have read on UseNet in postings \nby agents of the Turkish government. I understand both sides of the issue, but \nthis does not mean I will advocate both sides when it suits me. Such a \nposition would make me a hypocrite. I am also not being paid by agents of \nTurkey nor Azerbaijan as are many proponents of the Azeri side. I refer to \nagents such as Captioline International Group, Ltd., being paid in excess of \n$30,000/month by Azerbaijan. I state my case unencumbered by such advocacy or \nprostitution. \n\n[A] You do not have to change your mind for that - \n[A] just (as if you are playing chess) ask yourself -\n[A] what if? \n[A] What if your tone is so offensive that one type of\n[A] people loose control and start to erratically insult\n[A] you, and others emotionally detach themselves from\n[A] you writings and are not engaging in the discussion \n[A] with you?\n\nMy tone is not offensive. If people are offended by what I say than I just\nmay be too bad. This conflict, as is human conflict in general, is rather \nbleak and is surrounded by the most barbaric actions of man. Given such \nconditions, dispassion is rather difficult, and artificial at best. This does \nnot mean that discussion is out of the question. No conflict is ever resolved \nwithout discussion.\n\n[A] I'll try first. Recently I received a message from\n[A] a Russian guy who frequently visited Baku that \n[A] approximately after 1986 the old situation when \n[A] there were no anti-Armenian press had changed and\n[A] the press became very anti-Armenian and average\n[A] Azeri became an Armenian-hater. This is devastation \n[A] news for me because one of my cornerstones was the fact\n[A] that I MYSELF SAW ARMENIANS IN BAKU AMONG OTHER ETHNIC\n[A] GROUPS AND SAW, OR HEARD, OR READ NOTHING THAT WOULD\n[A] SEEM LIKE HATRED. You might say that an outsider never \n[A] sees, but by that time I was myself victimized as a member\n[A] of a minority by Russians and knew what to look for and\n[A] what innocent sign or remark might signify.\n\nI am sure. The Soviet Union effectively froze in time all ethnic problems it\ncreated or was brewing just after WWI. During the Soviet reign, officials \ntended to shape the frozen conflicts in such a way so when thawed, they \nwould serve the purposes of the internal policies of the Soviet Union or\nsuccessor states.\n\n[A] Again - one of my cornerstones show cracks. I will investigate.\n[A] Another cornerstone of my thought is that Armenia started\n[A] hostilities against Azeris in Armenia before anything happened\n[A] in Sumgait (not at all I am trying to justify violence in Sumgait\n[A] or anywhere else - I bow my head with grief and respect and \n[A] did demand and will laways demand that criminals be severely\n[A] punished according to the law of the land.\n[A] I would like you to supply me with the information about that.\n[A] Does or does not the hostilities began in Armenia? Was thousands\n[A] od Azeris thrown out of their homes and forced to leave Armeina\n[A] before Sumgait or not? \n\nSumgait took place in February of 1988. The Azeris of Armenia were expelled\nin the late fall of 1988. It took the entire summer of 1988 for the\nsituation to get so bad for Azeris in Armenian that the Russians had to\nevacuate them. I refer specifically to _Human Rights Violations in Armenia\nand Azerbaijan_, A report of Pax Christi Netherlands 12 September 1991. Also,\none need only read the newspaper to verify this. \n\nYou do realize, perhaps unknowingly -- perhaps not -- you are mirroring \nTurkish propaganda and lies regarding what took place when and where first!\n\n[A] Second - in your last message you used a very terrifying\n[A] phrase - \"Artificial borders\" when you were talking about \n[A] Armenian. Do you believe that Armenia have righteous territorial\n[A] claims? Do you believe that Armenia has rights to the lands that\n[A] currently belong to other countries? \n[A] Do you believe that this is stricktly Armenian priviledge or\n[A] everybody should start reclaiming what once was theirs?\n\nI had addressed this issue several time before -- perhaps I was not clear. The\ncurrent borders of Armenia were not set as a result of the consolidation of\na high Armenian culture. Today's Armenia is about 1/10 the land mass that\nsustained Armenians for nearly three millennia. It was the natural Armenian\nboundaries that sustained Armenians -- not the current boundaries. The current\nborders of Armenia would never support a society nor sustain its growth. Does \nthis mean that Armenia should expand? It might, if Armenia is not allowed to \nintegrate into the region. If this past winter is any indication of the future \nstatus of Armenia, then Armenia must do what it will to survive. \nUnfortunately, in my opinion, and you can quote me on this, as I am sure you \nand others will, the combined forces of both Armenia and Karabakh should have \ntaken Karabakh and the land in between in a matter of weeks in late 1991. This \nwould avoided all the pain and suffering both sides endured and would remove a \ntool of Russian influence in the Caucasus. You may call me a war-monger -- so \nbe it. If Armenians don't defend their right to live on the land they live on, \nthose rights will be taken away. The Azeris should not have the right to \nremove these Armenians, but given the first chance to, they will, as was \nproven throughout all of Azerbaijan. If the Soviet Union didn't break apart, \ntoday Karabakh would be emptied of Armenians. Operation Ring, started in early \n1991 emptied the northern 1/3 of Karabakh of Armenians, but the operation was \nsuspended by the disillusionment of the Soviet Union. Lucky for the Armenians! \nIf the Azeris feel as though they can expel all the Armenians of Karabakh, the \nArmenians will resist, if the Armenians can't live under Azeri oppression, \nthen they will fight for the right to live their lives free from such \noppression. If this means these Armenian demand independence, I support such a \nmove. If you can't understand this, as an Azeri, that is truly unfortunate. \nUntil this is understood by the Gray Wolves in Baku, more young Azeri men will \ndie in the pursuit of the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Karabakh \nArmenians.\n \n[A] Third thing - you keep saying about 3000 years of Armenian presence\n[A] in Karabakh. What exactly you mean by that? That there were Armenians\n[A] 3000 years ago in Karabah? Only Armenians? Or among other nations?\n[A] I saw (SAW) a Russian tax map of Karabah with all the landowners and\n[A] occupant names on it (the map was surveyed by Russian Army in 1810.\n[A] Would you believe that there were almost exclusivly Achmeds and Hu-\n[A] sseins? I also saw Armenian names, but the absolute majority of the\n[A] population was Muslim. If I am wrong - give me your sources, but\n[A] please, let us keep the rule that we only pay attention to third\n[A] party sources.\n[A] There are Russian diplomatic documents about the mission of the\n[A] Russian famous writer and diplomat Griboedov whose mission in Iran\n[A] was protection of Armenians that were persecuted by Persians and\n[A] RELOCATION these Armenians inside Russian Empire. According to\n[A] the Russian tax documents that was the time when the population of\n[A] Karabakh became predominantly (in some places) Armenian.\n\nKarabakh, or Artsakh as it is known in Armenian (and Urartian) is the only\npiece of Armenia that has a continuous Armenian occupation, from the\ntransformation of the Urartians to Armenians, nearly 3,000 years ago. You\nrefer to Russian and Muslim rulers over Karabakh, not the population! You\nsurely must know the rules of Muslim landownership over non-Muslims.\n\n[A] You write in your letter that \"Azeris were shelling Stepanakert which\n[A] now is almost completely destroyed\"  David - is it fair to say that \n[A] Stepanakert was destroyed by Azeris? There is that fine line between\n[A] propaganda and personal view, however bizzarre that view is - YOU KNOW\n[A] AS WELL AS ANYBODY WHO SAW TV IN THE TIMES OF THE EARTHQUAKE - that \n[A] Stepanakert was almost completely devastated by the quake. \n[A] But may be you believe that the damage from Azeri shelling is greater\n[A] than the damage from the quake? OK, no problem, AS LONG AS YOU MENTION\n[A] THE QUAKE. \n\nAs I wrote in a short response to you regarding this earlier. You may be\nconfusing Spitak with Stepanakert. There were no effects of the earthquake \nin Karabakh.\n\n[A] I want dialog. I am not interested in mud-throwing. And in dialog I want\n[A] honest opinions (one might be wrong, but one MUST be honest). Honest \n[A] opinions may be based on emotions but in this case one should indicate\n[A] that. But mostly we are looking for information based opinions.\n[A] I always ask myself - why I think that? Is it because I was told so\n[A] bt so many people that it became a truth? Or I read a book? Who wrote\n[A] it? What was his/her intentions/interests/whatever? \n\nFine. I stated my opinions and the reasons for them. If you put into action \nwhat you just stated above, you would understand my outrage at the posting of \nFarid who just posted items from some Islamic conference, etc., and just left \nit at that. He has done his numerous times. At least I responded to that \nposting, and was outraged that Farid simply copies other people`s text, posts \nit -- yet does not display the courage be responsible for what he posts. One \ncan always stand behind the facade of claiming what I write is polemic, \nhowever, as a result such irresponsibility I am free to make a claim of \ncowardice. \n\n[A] Please, give me sources, facts, titles of the books of third party\n[A] writers, etc.\n\nI believe I have, and can support what I claim. I don't make up history, nor\ndo I have to! I have done enough research regarding Turkish Genocide Apology \nto revisionism from good scholarship, and I will never fall victim to \nbottomless pit of making claims without a solid basis.\n\n[A] And please, answer my questions in the beginning of the letter.\n\n[A] And for you Armenian friends who do not like what I write - \n[A] sorry, but these are my thoughts and it is very disturbing\n[A] that you like people when they say what you like and dislike\n[A] them when they say something that you do not like. \n\nAlex, I stated my friends and associates where rather surprised as the tone of\nyour posting considering the fact that I had categorized you as an open-minded \nAzeri. Perhaps I was fooled by you? Perhaps I should believe that you are like \n\"all Azeris when it comes to Armenians\". I chose not to accept such a \nstatement. They were not surprised at what you said so much as it was coming \nfrom you, somebody from which they expected otherwise. You see, you didn't add \nanything to the issue, which was the expectation, only conforming old\nsuspicions.\n\n[A] For me\n[A] it is most inportant that a guy makes a honest effort to find\n[A] the truth. If so, he/she might have whatever opinion he/she\n[A] wants. I believe that telling people the truth, seeking it - is \n[A] far more noble than just support your race because it is yours.\n[A] That is a way of animals, primitive tribes and criminal societies.\n[A] Civilized people seek truth.\n\n[A] Cheers,\n\n[A] Alex\n\nIf you think I am intellectually dishonest, please demonstrate it. As I stated\nabove, I am partisan on this issue, thus expect me to take a stand in the\ninterest of the Armenians, not against Armenians. This stance should not seem \nstrange to you. I am not here to generate excuses for Armenians wanting to \nlive on the land they live on, and wanting to live in peace. If Armenians must \ndie for what they believe in, and make ultimate sacrifice, you had better \nlisten to them. No amount of rhetoric -- not from Yerevan, Baku, the CSCE, nor \npaid prostitutes in Washington -- will convince Karabakh Armenians otherwise! \n\n\n-- \nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"Armenia has not learned a lesson in\nS.D.P.A.

This is devastation \n[A] news for me because one of my cornerstones was the fact\n[A] that I MYSELF SAW ARMENIANS IN BAKU AMONG OTHER ETHNIC\n[A] GROUPS AND SAW, OR HEARD, OR READ NOTHING THAT WOULD\n[A] SEEM LIKE HATRED. You might say that an outsider never \n[A] sees, but by that time I was myself victimized as a member\n[A] of a minority by Russians and knew what to look for and\n[A] what innocent sign or remark might signify.\n\nI am sure. The Soviet Union effectively froze in time all ethnic problems it\ncreated or was brewing just after WWI. During the Soviet reign, officials \ntended to shape the frozen conflicts in such a way so when thawed, they \nwould serve the purposes of the internal policies of the Soviet Union or\nsuccessor states.\n\n[A] Again - one of my cornerstones show cracks. I will investigate.\n[A] Another cornerstone of my thought is that Armenia started\n[A] hostilities against Azeris in Armenia before anything happened\n[A] in Sumgait (not at all I am trying to justify violence in Sumgait\n[A] or anywhere else - I bow my head with grief and respect and \n[A] did demand and will laways demand that criminals be severely\n[A] punished according to the law of the land.\n[A] I would like you to supply me with the information about that.\n[A] Does or does not the hostilities began in Armenia? Was thousands\n[A] od Azeris thrown out of their homes and forced to leave Armeina\n[A] before Sumgait or not? \n\nSumgait took place in February of 1988. The Azeris of Armenia were expelled\nin the late fall of 1988. It took the entire summer of 1988 for the\nsituation to get so bad for Azeris in Armenian that the Russians had to\nevacuate them. I refer specifically to _Human Rights Violations in Armenia\nand Azerbaijan_, A report of Pax Christi Netherlands 12 September 1991. Also,\none need only read the newspaper to verify this. \n\nYou do realize, perhaps unknowingly -- perhaps not -- you are mirroring \nTurkish propaganda and lies regarding what took place when and where first!\n\n[A] Second - in your last message you used a very terrifying\n[A] phrase - \"Artificial borders\" when you were talking about \n[A] Armenian. Do you believe that Armenia have righteous territorial\n[A] claims? Do you believe that Armenia has rights to the lands that\n[A] currently belong to other countries? \n[A] Do you believe that this is stricktly Armenian priviledge or\n[A] everybody should start reclaiming what once was theirs?\n\nI had addressed this issue several time before -- perhaps I was not clear. The\ncurrent borders of Armenia were not set as a result of the consolidation of\na high Armenian culture. Today's Armenia is about 1/10 the land mass that\nsustained Armenians for nearly three millennia. It was the natural Armenian\nboundaries that sustained Armenians -- not the current boundaries. The current\nborders of Armenia would never support a society nor sustain its growth. Does \nthis mean that Armenia should expand? It might, if Armenia is not allowed to \nintegrate into the region. If this past winter is any indication of the future \nstatus of Armenia, then Armenia must do what it will to survive. \nUnfortunately, in my opinion, and you can quote me on this, as I am sure you \nand others will, the combined forces of both Armenia and Karabakh should have \ntaken Karabakh and the land in between in a matter of weeks in late 1991. This \nwould avoided all the pain and suffering both sides endured and would remove a \ntool of Russian influence in the Caucasus. You may call me a war-monger -- so \nbe it. If Armenians don't defend their right to live on the land they live on, \nthose rights will be taken away. The Azeris should not have the right to \nremove these Armenians, but given the first chance to, they will, as was \nproven throughout all of Azerbaijan. If the Soviet Union didn't break apart, \ntoday Karabakh would be emptied of Armenians. Operation Ring, started in early \n1991 emptied the northern 1/3 of Karabakh of Armenians, but the operation was \nsuspended by the disillusionment of the Soviet Union. Lucky for the Armenians! \nIf the Azeris feel as though they can expel all the Armenians of Karabakh, the \nArmenians will resist, if the Armenians can't live under Azeri oppression, \nthen they will fight for the right to live their lives free from such \noppression. If this means these Armenian demand independence, I support such a \nmove. If you can't understand this, as an Azeri, that is truly unfortunate. \nUntil this is understood by the Gray Wolves in Baku, more young Azeri men will \ndie in the pursuit of the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Karabakh \nArmenians.\n \n[A] Third thing - you keep saying about 3000 years of Armenian presence\n[A] in Karabakh. What exactly you mean by that? That there were Armenians\n[A] 3000 years ago in Karabah? Only Armenians? Or among other nations?\n[A] I saw (SAW) a Russian tax map of Karabah with all the landowners and\n[A] occupant names on it (the map was surveyed by Russian Army in 1810.\n[A] Would you believe that there were almost exclusivly Achmeds and Hu-\n[A] sseins? I also saw Armenian names, but the absolute majority of the\n[A] population was Muslim. If I am wrong - give me your sources, but\n[A] please, let us keep the rule that we only pay attention to third\n[A] party sources.\n[A] There are Russian diplomatic documents about the mission of the\n[A] Russian famous writer and diplomat Griboedov whose mission in Iran\n[A] was protection of Armenians that were persecuted by Persians and\n[A] RELOCATION these Armenians inside Russian Empire. According to\n[A] the Russian tax documents that was the time when the population of\n[A] Karabakh became predominantly (in some places) Armenian.\n\nKarabakh, or Artsakh as it is known in Armenian (and Urartian) is the only\npiece of Armenia that has a continuous Armenian occupation, from the\ntransformation of the Urartians to Armenians, nearly 3,000 years ago. You\nrefer to Russian and Muslim rulers over Karabakh, not the population! You\nsurely must know the rules of Muslim landownership over non-Muslims.\n\n[A] You write in your letter that \"Azeris were shelling Stepanakert which\n[A] now is almost completely destroyed\"  David - is it fair to say that \n[A] Stepanakert was destroyed by Azeris? There is that fine line between\n[A] propaganda and personal view, however bizzarre that view is - YOU KNOW\n[A] AS WELL AS ANYBODY WHO SAW TV IN THE TIMES OF THE EARTHQUAKE - that \n[A] Stepanakert was almost completely devastated by the quake. \n[A] But may be you believe that the damage from Azeri shelling is greater\n[A] than the damage from the quake? OK, no problem, AS LONG AS YOU MENTION\n[A] THE QUAKE. \n\nAs I wrote in a short response to you regarding this earlier. You may be\nconfusing Spitak with Stepanakert. There were no effects of the earthquake \nin Karabakh.\n\n[A] I want dialog. I am not interested in mud-throwing. And in dialog I want\n[A] honest opinions (one might be wrong, but one MUST be honest). Honest \n[A] opinions may be based on emotions but in this case one should indicate\n[A] that. But mostly we are looking for information based opinions.\n[A] I always ask myself - why I think that? Is it because I was told so\n[A] bt so many people that it became a truth? Or I read a book? Who wrote\n[A] it? What was his/her intentions/interests/whatever? \n\nFine. I stated my opinions and the reasons for them. If you put into action \nwhat you just stated above, you would understand my outrage at the posting of \nFarid who just posted items from some Islamic conference, etc., and just left \nit at that. He has done his numerous times. At least I responded to that \nposting, and was outraged that Farid simply copies other people`s text, posts \nit -- yet does not display the courage be responsible for what he posts. One \ncan always stand behind the facade of claiming what I write is polemic, \nhowever, as a result such irresponsibility I am free to make a claim of \ncowardice. \n\n[A] Please, give me sources, facts, titles of the books of third party\n[A] writers, etc.\n\nI believe I have, and can support what I claim. I don't make up history, nor\ndo I have to! I have done enough research regarding Turkish Genocide Apology \nto revisionism from good scholarship, and I will never fall victim to \nbottomless pit of making claims without a solid basis.\n\n[A] And please, answer my questions in the beginning of the letter.\n\n[A] And for you Armenian friends who do not like what I write - \n[A] sorry, but these are my thoughts and it is very disturbing\n[A] that you like people when they say what you like and dislike\n[A] them when they say something that you do not like. \n\nAlex, I stated my friends and associates where rather surprised as the tone of\nyour posting considering the fact that I had categorized you as an open-minded \nAzeri. Perhaps I was fooled by you? Perhaps I should believe that you are like \n\"all Azeris when it comes to Armenians\". I chose not to accept such a \nstatement. They were not surprised at what you said so much as it was coming \nfrom you, somebody from which they expected otherwise. You see, you didn't add \nanything to the issue, which was the expectation, only conforming old\nsuspicions.\n\n[A] For me\n[A] it is most inportant that a guy makes a honest effort to find\n[A] the truth. If so, he/she might have whatever opinion he/she\n[A] wants. I believe that telling people the truth, seeking it - is \n[A] far more noble than just support your race because it is yours.\n[A] That is a way of animals, primitive tribes and criminal societies.\n[A] Civilized people seek truth.\n\n[A] Cheers,\n\n[A] Alex\n\nIf you think I am intellectually dishonest, please demonstrate it. As I stated\nabove, I am partisan on this issue, thus expect me to take a stand in the\ninterest of the Armenians, not against Armenians. This stance should not seem \nstrange to you. I am not here to generate excuses for Armenians wanting to \nlive on the land they live on, and wanting to live in peace. If Armenians must \ndie for what they believe in, and make ultimate sacrifice, you had better \nlisten to them. No amount of rhetoric -- not from Yerevan, Baku, the CSCE, nor \npaid prostitutes in Washington -- will convince Karabakh Armenians otherwise! \n\n\n-- \nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"Armenia has not learned a lesson in\nS.D.P.A.

The 27th was a short day at\nwork, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided\nto go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal\nFlame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had\nwalked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes\nbehind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24\nVolga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the \ncar. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,\nand the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and \nher hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to \n45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help\nthem. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?\n\nWhen I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was, \nbut it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the \nEternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle\naround it. I ask, \"What's going on?\" Someone tells me, \"Come listen.\" Well\nthey were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \"Brother\nMuslims, our time has come . . . \" and something else along that line. I\ndidn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to \nget a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. \nNew people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And\nthe comments started: \"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\" and \"There's\nno need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\" I even heard that: \"All \nMoscow is behind us.\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this \nwas no joke. I quietly left and went home.\n\nNow before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, \nthat there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of \nthings, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.\n\nMy wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku. \nI didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two\no'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and \nshouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,\nlike they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a \ndemonstration and move slowly.\n\nMy wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some\noutdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd\npeople are shouting \"Down with the Armenians!\" and \"Death to the Armenians!\" I\nwaited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street \non the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned \nand went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26 \nBaku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there \nwas a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same \nkind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside \nfrom the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young\npeople in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.\n\nMy wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of\nuneasy and said, \"No, let's stay at home instead.\" An hour went by, or maybe \nan hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say\nexactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on\nthe side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.\n\nI put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside,\nand the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time \nthere were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more \naggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration.\nThey would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run \nagain. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I \nfollowed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was \nleading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one \nside, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square \nand heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There \nwas some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.\nI heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \"We don't need \nperestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\" Now what did they \nmean by \"living like we have been?\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. \nBut too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense \nof others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just \nin Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it \nanywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.\n\nNow at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians' \napartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't \nhear them say \"kill them\" over the microphone, I only heard \"beat them and \ndrive them out.\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then\nanother are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off\nto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and \nI think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.\nThere were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try \nto pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.\n\nWell I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no\ndemonstration, and I had to protect my family.\n\nI left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next\nto the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-\nlor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-\nthing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because\nafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons\nin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City \nParty Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I \nsaw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the \ncases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 \nto 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried \noff by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing\nright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe \nabout the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. \nWhen I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was \nabout a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He \nhas a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I \nhave never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of \npeople smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled \naround and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.\n\nBefore I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. \nI turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am, \nI thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. \nAnd I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the \nstreet. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, \nwhich had \"Ermeni oryum\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \"Death to \nArmenians!\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really\nknow what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is\nRafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark\nblue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His \nfamily, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on \nNarimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; \ntheir apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the \nleft. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a \nnew apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son \nwas carrying a flag that said \"Death to Armenians!\" I was surprised because \nbefore this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being \ndone not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.\n\nWell anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \"It's OK, it'll pass, \nthey're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\" Naturally I didn't \nwant her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And \nthis time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't \nsee where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't \nhanding out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking \nand smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and \nhashish to put in a store window!\n\nSo the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one \nwould stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again, \nthe police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't \nbreaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. \nTrue, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much-\nvaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people \ndied, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I \ncouldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be \nspecific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of \nSumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.\n\nWhen they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \"Let's go upstairs.\" \nWe went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the \nevening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.\nI stopped at \"The Corner,\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I \nlook and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to \nthe bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. \nThe crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed \ntoward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, \nwheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as \nthough it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more \nnoise, and the glass was flying again.\n\nWe spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor,\nthere was really no way to defend yourself there.\n\nIn the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. \nOn the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or \nwhat happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the \nbread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying \nthere hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing\nyou couldn't even see him.\n\nThat was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.\n\n   May 17, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on\nthe side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.\n\nI put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside,\nand the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time \nthere were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more \naggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration.\nThey would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run \nagain. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I \nfollowed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was \nleading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one \nside, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square \nand heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There \nwas some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.\nI heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \"We don't need \nperestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\" Now what did they \nmean by \"living like we have been?\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. \nBut too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense \nof others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just \nin Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it \nanywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.\n\nNow at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians' \napartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't \nhear them say \"kill them\" over the microphone, I only heard \"beat them and \ndrive them out.\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then\nanother are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off\nto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and \nI think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.\nThere were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try \nto pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.\n\nWell I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no\ndemonstration, and I had to protect my family.\n\nI left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next\nto the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-\nlor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-\nthing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because\nafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons\nin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City \nParty Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I \nsaw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the \ncases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 \nto 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried \noff by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing\nright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe \nabout the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. \nWhen I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was \nabout a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He \nhas a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I \nhave never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of \npeople smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled \naround and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.\n\nBefore I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. \nI turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am, \nI thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. \nAnd I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the \nstreet. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, \nwhich had \"Ermeni oryum\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \"Death to \nArmenians!\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really\nknow what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is\nRafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark\nblue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His \nfamily, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on \nNarimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; \ntheir apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the \nleft. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a \nnew apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son \nwas carrying a flag that said \"Death to Armenians!\" I was surprised because \nbefore this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being \ndone not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.\n\nWell anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \"It's OK, it'll pass, \nthey're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\" Naturally I didn't \nwant her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And \nthis time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't \nsee where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't \nhanding out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking \nand smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and \nhashish to put in a store window!\n\nSo the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one \nwould stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again, \nthe police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't \nbreaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. \nTrue, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much-\nvaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people \ndied, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I \ncouldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be \nspecific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of \nSumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.\n\nWhen they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \"Let's go upstairs.\" \nWe went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the \nevening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.\nI stopped at \"The Corner,\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I \nlook and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to \nthe bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. \nThe crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed \ntoward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, \nwheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as \nthough it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more \nnoise, and the glass was flying again.\n\nWe spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor,\nthere was really no way to defend yourself there.\n\nIn the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. \nOn the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or \nwhat happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the \nbread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying \nthere hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing\nyou couldn't even see him.\n\nThat was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.\n\n   May 17, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

EDT\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n\t     \n\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n\t     \n\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n\t     \n\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n\t     \n\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n\t     \n\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n\t     \n\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n\t     \n\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n\t     \n\t     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n\t     \n\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n\t     \n\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \nsector.\n\t     \n\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \ncreated before.\n\t     \n\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n\t     \n\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\n\t     \n\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n\t     \n\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \nthe environment.  \n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \nhas never fully emphasized before.  \n\t     \n\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \nyear.  \n\t     \n\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \nenvironment.  \n\t     \n\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \nthey earn, but letting them earn.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n\t     \n\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \n\t     \n\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \ninvestments as well. \n\t     \n\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     That does not mean young people should not be \nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n\t     \n\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \nyoung people want.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \nkidding.  \n\t     \n\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n\t     \n\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n\t     \n\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n\t     \n\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n\t     \n\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\n                                 END11:45 A.M.

EDT\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n\t     \n\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n\t     \n\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n\t     \n\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n\t     \n\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n\t     \n\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n\t     \n\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n\t     \n\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n\t     \n\t     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n\t     \n\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n\t     \n\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \nsector.\n\t     \n\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \ncreated before.\n\t     \n\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n\t     \n\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\n\t     \n\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n\t     \n\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \nthe environment.  \n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \nhas never fully emphasized before.  \n\t     \n\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \nyear.  \n\t     \n\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \nenvironment.  \n\t     \n\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \nthey earn, but letting them earn.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n\t     \n\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \nahead.

I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.

It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n\t     \n\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n\t     \n\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n\t     \n\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n\t     \n\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\n                                 END11:45 A.M. EDT"}

In comparison, in \nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \nrespectively). Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \n\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \nPrevention Svcs, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \nand gang affiliation. The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \nand health-care providers. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \nstudy. Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \nby p values of less than 0.05. Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \n(no-law states). Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \n43.2%, respectively). High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \n\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \ndirected at parents with young children. Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance \nin metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for \nthe years 1983-1988. Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program \nand the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-\nbased surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The \nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \npool, or random variation. Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance \nconducted from October 1988 through May 1989. Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices \nof 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO \ncollaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza \nviruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and \nterritorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians. \nNonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received \nthroughout the year. Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B \nviruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency \noverall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted \nover the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices \nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \nA(H1N1). Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \nAuthors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona\n\n                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies\n\nFollowing the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-\nET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been \ndeveloped that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT), \nembryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together, \nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \ntechnology (ART) procedures. \n\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \n\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \ntraditional therapies. \n\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \n\no in vitro \no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \n  transfer \no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \ntowards improved success of these technologies. \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                           Future Areas of Research\n\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \ndisease. \n\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \n\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \nsex-linked disorders. \n\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \nof affected children. \n\n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, Arizona\n\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for theManagement of Infertility\n\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \n\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \ntraditional therapies. The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \n\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \nand/or idiopathic infertility.    The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \nthrough enzymatic digestion. Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \nestablish conception. \n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \n--------- end of part 2 ------------\n\n---Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na\n\n[Requirement] Rewrite the email in an informal and engaging style.

In comparison, in \nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \nrespectively). Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \n\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \nPrevention Svcs, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \nand gang affiliation. The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \nand health-care providers. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \nstudy. Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \nby p values of less than 0.05. Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \n(no-law states). Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \n43.2%, respectively). High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \n\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \ndirected at parents with young children. Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance \nin metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for \nthe years 1983-1988. Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program \nand the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-\nbased surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The \nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \npool, or random variation. Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance \nconducted from October 1988 through May 1989. Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices \nof 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO \ncollaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza \nviruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and \nterritorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians. \nNonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received \nthroughout the year. Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B \nviruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency \noverall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted \nover the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices \nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \nA(H1N1). Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \nAuthors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona\n\n                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies\n\nFollowing the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-\nET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been \ndeveloped that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT), \nembryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together, \nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \ntechnology (ART) procedures. \n\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \n\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \ntraditional therapies. \n\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \n\no in vitro \no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \n  transfer \no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \ntowards improved success of these technologies. \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                           Future Areas of Research\n\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \ndisease. \n\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \n\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \nsex-linked disorders. \n\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \nof affected children. \n\n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, Arizona\n\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for theManagement of Infertility\n\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \n\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \ntraditional therapies. The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \n\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \nand/or idiopathic infertility.    The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \nthrough enzymatic digestion. Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \nestablish conception. \n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \n--------- end of part 2 ------------\n\n---Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na"}

EDT\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n\t     \n\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n\t     \n\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n\t     \n\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n\t     \n\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n\t     \n\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n\t     \n\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n\t     \n\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n\t     \n\t     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n\t     \n\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n\t     \n\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \nsector.\n\t     \n\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \ncreated before.\n\t     \n\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n\t     \n\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\n\t     \n\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n\t     \n\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \nthe environment.  \n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \nhas never fully emphasized before.  \n\t     \n\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \nyear.  \n\t     \n\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \nenvironment.  \n\t     \n\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \nthey earn, but letting them earn.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n\t     \n\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \n\t     \n\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \ninvestments as well. \n\t     \n\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     That does not mean young people should not be \nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n\t     \n\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \nyoung people want.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \nkidding.  \n\t     \n\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n\t     \n\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n\t     \n\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n\t     \n\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n\t     \n\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\n                                 END11:45 A.M.

EDT\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n\t     \n\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n\t     \n\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n\t     \n\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n\t     \n\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n\t     \n\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n\t     \n\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n\t     \n\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n\t     \n\t     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n\t     \n\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n\t     \n\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.

And to all of you who \nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     That does not mean young people should not be \nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n\t     \n\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \nyoung people want.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \nkidding.  \n\t     \n\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n\t     \n\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n\t     \n\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n\t     \n\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n\t     \n\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\n                                 END11:45 A.M. EDT"}

Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian\nwithout neglecting the need for scientific rigor.\n\n\n(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing\nwill be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med\nsince most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the\nreplies, if any, will be med-related.)\n\n\nIn article banschbach@vms.ocom.okstate.edu writes:\n\n>I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed.\n>Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. \n>Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a woman \n>poster for being treated by a licenced physician for a disease that did \n>not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible, Steve, and I \n>see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \n\nThey are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).\nOops, that is not a recognized \"illness\" in the psychological community,\nbetter not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)\n\nActually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians\nwill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,\njust e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general\npopulation, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among\nphysicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage -\nany help here a.p.p.er's?)\n\nOne driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious\ncholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to\ncontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are\nalso extroverted, they are best described as \"Field Marshalls\".  This trait\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the \"dark-side\" of this\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\n\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've\nknown many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them\nwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they\nusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an\nextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).\n\nMaybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)\n\nEnough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.\n\n\n>Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \n>no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that \n>balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics...  Could it just be\n>professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.\n\nYou've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\nmyself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion\nabove the level of anal effluent.\n\n\n>...Humans have all \n>kinds of different organisms living in the GI system (mouth, stomach, small \n>and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \n>nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \n>system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \n>the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \n>toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \n>these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \n>residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \n>happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\n\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\ntherapy below).\n\n\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\nconsidered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\ninfection.\n\n\n>Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals \n>and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \n>vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \n>Elaine's doctor a quack.\n\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\n\nHopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\nall supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\n\n\n>survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \n>the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \n\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\nnormal).\n\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\ninflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it\nis relevant to this discussion.\n\n\n>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \n>membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \n>the candida or not isn't certain.\n\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\nirritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\n\nBTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\ndoesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\n\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\nlots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who\nhas to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\n\n\n>If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \n>nondescript.  \n\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\nand reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\n\nIt's a real Catch-22.\n\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the\nsmaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\n\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - \nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\n\n\n>Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \n>the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \n>vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \n>ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \n>they broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \n>response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \n>from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than \n>they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \n>A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \n>barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \n>inflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \n\nAren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\n\n\n>While diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \n>this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \n>knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \n>competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \n>available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \n>use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \n>the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \n>inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \n>antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \n>just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \n>vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\n\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\nyou can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It's like trying to weed a garden\nby cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\nout again once you walk away.\n\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\nis potentially lethal.\n\n\n>In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \n>reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \n>favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \n>humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \n>minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \n\nAlso, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\n\n\n>If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \n>blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \n>bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \n>occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \n>for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \n>place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \n>but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \n>has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \n>specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \n>false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \n>basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have \n>colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \n>doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\n\nAs I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work.\nFor example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\nexperience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to \"live with\nit\".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\nbecause of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\n\n\n>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \n>GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \n>patients is a non-existent syndrome.\n\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\nvisits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said \"you'll just have\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\npractice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\n\"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\n\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\nthousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\ninstead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\nwe don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\nwent to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\n\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me:\n\"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\ncountry, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\ncan't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\nthese unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State\nBoard.\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\n(true quackery).\n\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\n\n\n>If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \n>aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\n>But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \n>needs to be strengthened.

Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible, Steve, and I \n>see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \n\nThey are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).\nOops, that is not a recognized \"illness\" in the psychological community,\nbetter not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)\n\nActually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians\nwill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,\njust e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general\npopulation, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among\nphysicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage -\nany help here a.p.p.er's?)\n\nOne driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious\ncholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to\ncontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are\nalso extroverted, they are best described as \"Field Marshalls\".  This trait\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the \"dark-side\" of this\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\n\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've\nknown many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them\nwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they\nusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an\nextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).\n\nMaybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)\n\nEnough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.\n\n\n>Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \n>no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that \n>balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics...  Could it just be\n>professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.\n\nYou've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\nmyself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion\nabove the level of anal effluent.\n\n\n>...Humans have all \n>kinds of different organisms living in the GI system (mouth, stomach, small \n>and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \n>nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \n>system is compromised.

But any of \n>these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \n>residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \n>happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\n\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\ntherapy below).\n\n\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\nconsidered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\ninfection.\n\n\n>Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals \n>and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \n>vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \n>Elaine's doctor a quack.\n\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\n\nHopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\nall supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\n\n\n>survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \n>the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \n\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\nnormal).\n\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\ninflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it\nis relevant to this discussion.\n\n\n>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \n>membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \n>the candida or not isn't certain.\n\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\nirritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\n\nBTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\ndoesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\n\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\nlots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who\nhas to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\n\n\n>If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \n>nondescript.  \n\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\nand reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\n\nIt's a real Catch-22.\n\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the\nsmaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\n\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - \nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\n\n\n>Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \n>the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \n>vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \n>ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \n>they broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \n>response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \n>from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than \n>they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \n>A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \n>barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \n>inflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \n\nAren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\n\n\n>While diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \n>this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \n>knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \n>competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \n>available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \n>use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \n>the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \n>inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \n>antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \n>just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \n>vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\n\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\nyou can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It's like trying to weed a garden\nby cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\nout again once you walk away.\n\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\nis potentially lethal.\n\n\n>In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \n>reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \n>favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \n>humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \n>minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \n\nAlso, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\n\n\n>If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \n>blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \n>bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \n>occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \n>for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \n>place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \n>but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \n>has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \n>specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \n>false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \n>basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have \n>colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \n>doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\n\nAs I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work.\nFor example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\nexperience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to \"live with\nit\".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\nbecause of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\n\n\n>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \n>GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \n>patients is a non-existent syndrome.\n\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\nvisits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said \"you'll just have\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\npractice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\n\"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\n\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\nthousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\ninstead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\nwe don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\nwent to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\n\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me:\n\"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\ncountry, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\ncan't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\nthese unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State\nBoard.\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\n(true quackery).\n\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\n\n\n>If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \n>aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\n>But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \n>needs to be strengthened.

\n他让一个家族的姓氏,成为一个帝国的旗号！\n踏过时空的界限，抛却身份的束缚，引领着一个曾经辉煌的家族走上又一个辉煌的顶点，做一件骨子里想实现的事情。\n怒目扬眉，凭借未知的三根金指，在动乱的四国、勾心斗角的九大世家以及名贯。\n天下的十方名将之间谋得他应有的地位。\n\n\n作品相关\n\n\n番外篇\n花非花，雾非雾，茫茫之中自有销魂处\n燕历平光XX年，天下大定。\n不过，虽说天下大定，可有些地方还是不怎么平稳。但是，总得来说并无有太大的匪事兵乱，百姓尚算安居乐业，倒也安稳。\n红枫镇，燕国之中的一个小小城镇。人口寥寥数千。此处民风淳朴，各家各户都以打猎为生。其实说它是一个镇，倒不如将它称之为一个村子来的合适。而它之所以会被称之为红枫镇，乃是因为这个镇子的周围，还有旁边的山上都是红枫树。每到秋季漫天遍野都是火红色的红枫，如火般红艳，将整个镇子笼罩在其中，显得这个镇子妩媚如韵味十足的少女，格外的迷人。\n故此成名，被人称之为红枫镇。\n时值秋季，傍晚时分。晕红的夕阳西陲落幕，将天地都笼上了一层朦朦的色彩，尤其醉人。红枫镇十里外，一处布局古韵清雅的小庄园中。此庄园里跟别的地方一样，种满了红枫。只见那似火红艳的红枫树下宛然立着一人。一个发丝如墨，白衣似雪，身形玲珑，容貌绝色，浑身散发着一股清雅气息的女子。\n只是，绝色女子一袭白衣，发丝如墨，本应是一个清姣绝艳的女子。可是，在那落幕夕阳下和红枫树的衬托之下，竟是生生地生出了几分妩媚妖艳的美感。就宛如一株鲜艳似血的曼陀罗花，开在了清澈的水中，美到极致，艳到了极致，媚到了十分，让人望而心迷，近而失魂。让清醒者看着就会恨不能将她牢牢地禁锢在怀里，再也不放手。\n事实上，也确实正有人在这么做。\n但见一阵清风吹起，吹起了满地落叶红枫，漫天飞舞不停，遮住了人的视线，一时间什么都看不清。\n片刻，待那风停，落叶重归于地的时候，白衣女子已被人抱在了怀中。那是一个青年男子。男子容貌俊美无俦，身姿健硕挺拔，气质贵雅不凡，眉目间流转间在看向怀中女子的时候，溢满了似水柔情。\n看着这个男子，绝色女子那犹如凝脂般的脸庞上氤氲而起一抹淡粉晕红。她轻启朱唇，美目中蕴含点点娇羞，欲说还休地看着男子，似是想说什么，却终是没有说出口……\n见她这般，俊美男子的眸底划过一道温柔却炽热的光芒，他左手揽着女子的腰身，右手轻柔地抚上了女子的朱唇。轻轻地摩擦着，他说道：“你可知我等这一天等了多久……我本以为你我之间会永无交际，我早已经打算用我自己的方式来守护你。直到你我死去。”话锋一转，俊美男子的语气变得有些低沉：“可是，天怜你我。到头来我终是掌握住了我的命运，推翻了命运。从此以后，再无人能左右我，也无人能伤得了你。你……可开心？”\n青年男子说这句话的时候，有些小心翼翼地样子。却也是心中在乎，所以不能做到像对外人那般的无所顾忌，狠厉无情。\n爱，深深地爱，所以，才会将对方的喜怒哀乐放在心头。\n俊美男子的话让绝色女子那双如琉璃般美丽的眼眸中染起了一抹特别复杂的色彩。似爱恋，似挣扎，似惶恐，似……最后，她睫毛轻颤，眯上了眼睛。但是，她那朱红唇瓣轻启，却颤颤地吐出了几个字：“漠儿……不值……为了我……不值……不值……”说着，两行晶莹清泪从她的眼角滚落，一滴滴落在了俊美男子的衣袖上……。\n惹得俊美男子那双深邃如海的眼眸越发幽暗，他动作极其轻柔地将唇贴上了女子的眼角，允掉了她眼角的泪珠。他的这个动作让绝色女子猛然睁开了双眼。她的双眼中闪烁着一种名为震惊的色彩……她语气轻颤的叫道：“韩漠…你…！”也不难怪她会这般，因为过去的时间里，她和他一直都是以礼相处。从未逾越底线。\n也正是她这一声惊呼，将俊美男子的身份托然而出，此男子正是韩漠。而这白衣女子，宛然就是已然‘死’去了一年之久的苏玉碧，被韩府人称‘碧姨娘’！！\n过往如烟，暂且不提。\n碧姨娘这副震惊如斯的表情让韩漠环抱她腰身的手臂紧了紧。只见韩漠深深地凝视着她，缓而不慢的说道：“值与不值，并不是由别人说了算，也不是你说了就能算。我只知我心中有你，认定了你，这就足矣！至于其他的，不在我的考虑范围内。”\n“一年，现在已经整整一年。我已经没有办法再去等待一年。给我一个结果。这样的生活你开不开心，想不想要。要不要一直这样下去！若是你不要，那么，我绝不会再出现你的面前。我会转身离去！若是想要，那么，我韩漠就此起誓，绝不负你！在世人舆论下，我不能给予你光明正大的身份，可我！！却会给予你唯一！一生的唯一！”\n“现在，在最短的时间里把你的答案告诉我。不要去担心别的，问问你自己的心，你想要什么。”\n要什么？碧姨娘一时慌乱无章，不知该怎么说。不知怎么说，正是因为灵魂深处早已根深蒂固地种下了一些东西。没有办法冲破，没有勇气去打碎。纵是心底很想回答‘要’，却没勇气诉说出来。\n久久……亦或者只是片刻。在碧姨娘天人交战的时候，韩漠突然松开了环抱着她腰身的手臂。背对她，韩漠语气‘忧伤’的说道：“我懂了……你不必为难。从今以后我不会再出现在这里。我会如你所愿，让你安静地生活下去……保重……”\n嘴上这么说，韩漠却在心中暗道：如果你没有勇气来打破它，那么，就让我来打破吧。只要能跟你在一起，我并不介意说一回谎话，做一次戏。\n这么想着，韩漠转身就要‘离去’。却被一双柔荑紧紧抱住，属于碧姨娘那娇柔动听的声音从他背后传来。\n“漠儿……不要……不要走……我……我……我……我……”断断续续半天，碧姨娘也没说出接下来的话。\n韩漠却已经得到想要的东西。他唇角微微上翘，说了一句：“无悔？”\n一瞬间，碧姨娘仿佛看透了一些什么，她柔柔地说道：“不悔……”说完，她的脸颊在韩漠的后背蹭了蹭。\n感受到触及后背的那两个温暖的柔软，一股火气从韩漠体内升起。苦苦压抑了许久的火焰就这么激烈迸发，他忽然转身把她紧紧地抱住，狠狠地吻上了她的唇。直至将她吻得气喘吁吁，双颊红晕，美目中情慾水雾骤起，他方才松开她的唇。紧接，他把她拦腰抱起，飞身进了屋子……\n片刻……屋内欢泣呻吟起，夹杂着男子的粗喘呼吸……一切组合成了一曲扉靡无比的乐曲……却不觉淫靡，反令人心生温馨……\n……小小三粉著\n\n\n关于三根金手指\n    三根金手指的设定，带有一定的玄幻色彩，当初也有不少人就此议论，褒贬不一，但是我最终还是用上了。\n一指自救，一指杀敌，最后一指并没有用上，但是我相信韩漠终究会用上，全书完本的时候，他的生命才走到了一小半，在他往后的生涯中，必然不会是一帆风顺，也必然还会遇到许多的难题，而保留的一根金手指追随他，也就等于是一个希望在追随他。\n所以我愿意将第三根金手指成为希望的手指。\n并非是故作深沉，也不是自以为很有哲理，但是沙漠确实想说，你我同是生活在这个时代，或许会遇到许多的挫折困难，甚至会遇到太多的不平，但是我们心中都该保有希望，而希望的保留，是让我们在人生道路上继续前进的神秘动力。\n一直以来，我对自己的未来生活充满着希望和自信，有了希望的信念，才会让自己的每一步走的很轻松很大气。\n\n\n关于十方名将\n    十方名将是本书设定的一个重要因素，也可说为全书增色不少。\n不少朋友深有怨念，觉得全书完本了，却还没有将十方名将完全摆出来，但是沙漠想笑问一声，真的需要摆出来吗？\n甚至有人觉得这也是烂尾因素之一。\n或许不少人觉得故事戛然而止，会有一种猝然感，由此而产生烂尾之感，这个我都能理解，但是如果说十方名将没有清晰摆出来就算是烂尾，那我实在不敢苟同。\n在朝五大名将，我们都已经十分清楚，而在野名将，本就是一种神秘感。\n我想说明的，无非是这天底下这样一群才干之士，他们的人生价值取向不同，有的固然愿意成为国家的骨干，建功立业，定国安邦，但是却有一类人却有着自己的价值观，愿意泯然众人，过着自己想要的生活。\n在朝的名将固然值得尊敬，但是在野的名将依然值得钦佩。\n在野的名将，以他们的能力，想要求得荣华富贵，当然是易如反掌，但是他们却舍却荣华富贵，只为自己的理念和价值去活，这当然是一种十分正确的人生价值观。\n浮躁的社会，以金钱至上的社会变的喧嚣无比，那么是否所有的人都该在金钱权势之中翻滚？是否还能有人坚守着自己的某一种理想，以自己的生活方式去生活？\n虽然如今很难看到这种人，但是不可否认，在我们中国五千年的文明进程中，这类人曾经拥有许多，而他们的故事和处世哲理，后辈还是愿意回忆一下。\n所以这些人代表的只是一种隐士，他们不被框架束缚，代表的是一个稀少的群体。\n在野的名将，书中自然已经展现了不少，但是究竟谁才是真正的在野五大名将，我相信每个人都有自己的理解。\n\n\n关于写作\n    2009年的一个偶然机会，一个无聊的在业青年感觉生活乏味，又仗着自以为能书三分墨的本事，也自以为是地到了某点开始写书，当时满腔志气，觉得某人一出谁与争锋，在某点发文三万多字，成绩惨淡，正要罢笔远离此行，却不曾想天降贵人。\n纵横当时处于发展时期，编辑“落焰”姐姐找上了这个即将放弃写作的小瘪三，诚意邀请来纵横发展，虽然开出的是白菜价，但是这位小瘪三自觉地有伯乐降临，激动无比，愿追随“落焰”主公，作为马前卒，荡平四海，一统天下。\n    于是乎，某人第一部处女作《江山》开始在纵横连载，天马行空，完全没有网文经验的他在真正写书之后，才知道这行绝非想象的那般简单。\n从那时候起，此人日夜苦读，白天上班，晚上写字，由此拉开了屌丝的人生道路。\n其间，此人性格顽劣，屡次招惹事端，甚至没来由地被一些别有居心者诬陷坑害，遂明白世事不简单，在主公的教诲下，那张向来没有把门的大嘴开始安静，当初的少年心性也开始在主公的耐心教诲下，开始变得成熟起来，不招惹是非，只知道埋头长进自己，好好写书。\n    《江山》写完，一百八十万字落幕，此人获益良多，终于明白自己的诸多缺陷，但是从中也开始学会了如何构制框架，如何将一本书形成一个整体。\n节选正文：胡雪辛也忙道：“范大人所言极是。当初叶吴两家反叛，京中也是大动干戈，若非御林军反应迅速，这后果只怕是不堪设想啊！”\n皇帝皱眉道：“两位爱卿有何良策？”\n范云傲上前一步，恭敬道：“圣上，微臣恳请圣上下旨秀公主，派遣东花厅吏员暂且监视贺族官员，一旦其中有任何人出现异动，立刻秘密逮捕……等到夜里，京城九门封锁，调动御林军，连夜逮捕贺族官员……”\n燕京城有四大门，五偏门，合称“九门”！\n皇帝眼中闪过异色，并没有立刻说话。\n其实在皇帝的心中，对于范云傲提到东花厅，多少还是很为不满的。\n燕国的机构之中，完全听命于皇帝的，被皇帝抓的最紧的，恐怕也只有花厅了，就连皇家禁卫军的御林军，其中也是鱼龙混杂，渗透了世家的势力。\n在皇帝的心中，内阁可以插手所有的事情，但是绝对不能触及到花厅。\n此时范云傲提出由花厅来执行任务，就等于是内阁插手到花厅的运作，这让皇帝心中很不痛快，但是他同时也知道，既然范云傲此时提出来，那肯定是经过了内阁的共同商议。\n虽然皇族的实力在这一年大增，但是要抗衡内阁为主的世家势力，那还是远远不够。\n最为紧要的事，目前最重要的事情，是悄无声息地将贺族官员一网打尽，不能让贺族的官员在京中发起动乱。\n虽然贺族官员即使发起动乱，最终也会被扑灭，但是一场动乱，总会让京中出现很多的麻烦，更是会让京中出现一阵子混乱，那样一来，很有可能会被敌国的暗探们抓住时机，做出一些更不利于燕国的事情。\n\n[要求]

\n吉乐岛，位于太平洋，本来是一处没有人烟的荒岛，可是在最近一段时间，却突然兴旺起来。\n因为有个人把它买了下来，这个人就是谢文东。\n吉乐岛以前叫什么名字，他不知道，也不想知道，现在，他把它改名为吉乐，这是他和他的亲人、朋友的吉乐地带。\n谢文东到这里度假，或者说到这里来避难，已经有几个月的时间，过着神仙般的生活。\n在吉乐岛上，他并不寂寞，他的家人，他喜爱的人，都在这里，当然，也不缺少他的朋友。\n当谢文东初次来吉乐岛时，这还是一处未进行任何过开发的未知领域，当然，只要有钱，世界上没有多少事是办不成的。\n他在这里新建了第一栋别墅。很快，他的得力部下，也是他的兄弟，李爽也来了，而且不是一个人，还带来了他的家人。他对谢文东说：“这个小岛太荒凉，让伯父伯母两位老两口住在这里孤单寂寞，所以把自己家人带来，是为了让伯父伯母能找到说话谈心的人。”他的鬼心眼哪能瞒过谢文东的眼睛，傻子都知道，他在黑道混，怕仇家找上自己的家人，与其在中国过提心吊胆的日子，还不如到吉乐岛过无忧无虑、舒心的生活。而且别看李爽平时傻糊糊的，心里精明的很，他明白一个道理，谢文东在的地方，一定很安全，家人到这生活，一定不会出事。\n不管李爽是怎么打算的，谢文东欣然接受，在自家别墅旁边，又新建一栋。\n竣工之后，李爽高高兴兴把自己家人送过来，搬进别墅里。他在吉乐岛住了半个月时间，受不了这里无聊的生活，和谢文东打声招呼，又回中国了。\n李爽开了个好头！他是第一个，很快高强也来了。高强为人寡言，不象李爽那么能胡诌，当谢文东问他原因时，他只说两个字：“安全！”\n短短几个月时间，原本荒凉的小岛变的热闹起来，大兴土木，施工不断，刚开始的一栋别墅也变成现在近二十栋之多，文东会和原北洪门的许多骨干都效仿李爽和高强，把家人送到吉乐岛。\n谢文东原本以为自己可以在吉乐岛上安安稳稳地享受一段平静的生活，哪想到几个月下来，自己快变成‘包工头’了。\n白天，海边的沙滩上总是能看到身穿游装的中年男人在晒太阳，即使到晚上，时常也有大规模的聚会。\n当任长风来吉乐岛之前，一度以为谢文东在此地过着的是枯涩日子，可是当他坐着直升飞机，快接近目的地时，被岛上那一片花花绿绿的别墅吓了一跳，特别是在岛屿另一侧，竟然还兴建了一座码头，码头边旁若无人的停靠着一艘小型军舰。\n直升飞机缓缓停在岛屿东侧的停机坪上，他弯腰跳下飞机，终于看到多日未见、朝思暮想的谢文东。\n任长风为人清高，性格向来孤傲，除了他自己，能被他放在眼中的没几个，谢文东绝对是那没几个里的重中之重。\n没等说话，他眼圈一红，眼中先一片晶莹，双唇蠕动，一肚子话此时却一个字都说不出来。\n谢文东很喜欢任长风这个人，第一，他能力出众，本事过人，若论单打独斗，无论是北洪门还是文东会，每几个人能与他匹敌，第二，他的性情也十分让谢文东欣赏。\n见到他，谢文东当然甚是高兴，不等任长风说话，先笑眯眯地把他拉上一辆敞棚的吉普车，笑道：“有话，我们回家再说！”\n任长风坐上车，偷眼打量身旁的谢文东。他还是老样子，没什么太多变化，相貌依然清秀，身材依然消瘦，细长的眼睛弯弯的眯缝着，若说有变化，是他面颊比以前红润了一些，看起来更加健康。\n“我的变化大吗？”谢文东靠着椅子，仰面望天，笑眯眯地问道。他并没有看任长风，但却知道他在打量自己。\n唉！任长风叹口气，和东哥在一起，是毫无秘密而言的。很多没见过谢文东的人向他询问，谢文东究竟是什么样子的，他的回答是：“他有一双望穿秋水的眼睛，他有一种洞彻人心的眼神。”他笑道：“东哥的变化不大，看起来比以前更精神了。”\n“哈哈！”谢文东大笑，让任长风这样高傲的人说出恭维的话，无论怎么听都觉得别扭。\n任长风老脸一红，顿了一下，又道：“可是北洪门的变化太大了。”\n自谢文东走后，南北洪门停战，不久之后，达成联盟，虽然没有统一，但名称上已经没有南北之分，都叫洪门。\n至于盟主，由原南北洪门的老大共同担任。南洪门自然是向问天了，北洪门这边，由于谢文东出国，金老爷子退隐，一切都由东心雷做主，所以，洪门是由向问天和东心雷来主导。\n由于东心雷在智谋上弱于向问天，谢文东给他的建议是，他这个洪门老大只是名义上的，是为了安抚原北洪门的那些人，至于洪门大小的事务，应交由向问天做主。东心雷对谢文东的话言听计从，心甘情愿做了名义上的老大。现在的洪门，实际上是掌握在向问天的手里。而任长风做为原北洪门的骨干，和向问天争斗多年，从本质上，看不起他和南洪门那些干部，要他与这些人一起共事，对他来说实在是种煎熬。\n他这次来吉乐岛，就没打算回去。反正他孤家寡人一个，走到哪，哪就是家。\n谢文东知道他说的话是什么意思，别看他远离中国，但对洪门的事却了如指掌。他说道：“向问天是个英雄，把北洪门交给他，他不会排除异己，也不会生出事端，而且，以他的为人和能力，会把洪门带来一个好的发展前景。”\n任长风点点头，他心中也明白这个道理，可就是无法接受。\n吉普车在一座白色的别墅前停下，两人还没下车，已有四男两女从房中迎出来。\n任长风抬目一瞧，笑了，这六位他不仅认识，还是熟人。五行兄弟和小风，他自然不会陌生。\n见小风身着家居便装，腰间系围裙，一付家庭主妇的模样，任长风脸上笑容加深，半开玩笑道：“小风这身打扮倒是让人眼前一亮啊！”小风身为谢文东的贴身保镖，身手相当了得，别看人长得美艳漂亮，但动起手来，素有‘疯子’之称。\n小风撇撇嘴，白了他一眼，嘴唇挑了挑，不知道在嘟囔什么。\n任长风大笑两声，目光一转，打量起五行兄弟，这五人一各个红光满面，显然这一阵子睡得好，吃的香，没少享受清福。\n几人热情地打过招呼后，进入别墅。\n大厅内正有一条倩影在忙前忙后，向桌子上端饭菜，这位动人的女郎任长风也认识，她是彭玲。\n任长风没等脱鞋，先客客气气地叫一声：“嫂子好！”\n彭玲玉面一红，看看一旁的谢文东，招呼道：“快近来坐吧！”\n谢文东哈哈一笑，拍拍任长风肩膀，道：“别客气！”说着，来到彭玲身旁，笑呵呵看着桌上饭菜，笑道：“挺丰盛的嘛！”\n彭玲脸上露出妩媚的娇笑。高家两姐妹在中国读书，而金蓉在国外上学，平时照顾谢文东起居的都是彭玲，这段时间里，也是彭玲一直陪伴在他左右。\n任长风坐在沙发上，环视一圈，好奇地问道：“怎么没看到伯父伯母呢？”\n谢文东笑道：“我爸妈住在后面的别墅里。”\n“哦！”任长风点点头。谢文东又道：“你住的地方我也准备好了，一会带你去看看。”\n“谢谢！”任长风心中倍感温暖。\n“客气什么？！”谢文东笑道：“我们是兄弟嘛！”\n他一句简单的兄弟，却让任长风甚是受用。吃饭中，他想起自己来时看到的军舰，好奇地问道：“东哥，刚才我在飞机上，看到岛上还停有军舰，那是怎么回事？”\n谢文东大笑道：“那是我向黑带买的。本来想买艘游艇，可是黑带没有，就给我弄来一艘这个东西。”\n军舰？游艇？这完全是两种性质嘛！谢文东说的轻描淡写，但任长风却暗暗佩服，俄罗斯的军舰，可是一般人有钱都买不来的，虽然只是小型号的。\n水镜老神在在道：“我们现在都把它当游艇用，没事时可以用它出海钓鱼！”\n扑！任长风差点喷饭，用军舰钓鱼？还真是第一次听说过。\n吃过饭后，谢文东带任长风到海边散步，小风远远在后面跟着。\n夕阳西下，落日映红天边和海角，清新的海风迎面扑来，让人浑身凉爽，有种说不出的舒适。岛屿的宁静，环境的美丽，让长时间生活在喧嚣都市的任长风仿佛置身于世外逃园。\n踩着柔软的沙滩，任长风幽幽叹息一声，问道：“东哥打算回国吗？”\n谢文东停下脚步，面对大海，说道：“回去，是一定要回去的，但不是现在。”\n任长风精神一振，忙问道：“那是什么时候？”\n谢文东摇摇头，道：“我不知道！即使现在回去，恐怕也难有什么作为，南北洪门已经达成联盟，实际上已经是统一了，我回去，又能做些什么呢？”\n任长风道：“可以挤掉向问天！偌大的洪门，怎能让他一人独有！？”\n谢文东微微一笑，背手望着夕阳，轻声说道：“再耀眼的骄阳，也有落下来的时候，何况是人呢？”\n任长风琢磨着他的话，正想发问，谢文东转头问道：“听说，现在有崛起一个新帮派，叫青帮。”\n“是的！”任长风点头道：“他们自称祖师爷是杜月笙，在全国很多地方都设有分堂，只是东哥在时，他们还没有浮出水面，只是在东哥走后不久，青帮突然变的高调起来，最近，和台洪门闹的不可开交。”\n谢文东挑眉问道：“青帮的势力已延伸到台湾了？”\n任长风道：“他们在台湾确实有很大的分堂，有消息说，他们本来就是从台湾兴起的，后来才发展到大陆。不过，青帮的总部在中国，这倒是真的。”\n“恩！”谢文东仰面，心中默默琢磨着。任长风的话，和暗组给自己的消息基本上差不多，以此来看，洪门和青帮的碰撞是迟早的事情，毕竟中国只有一个，地下的皇帝也只能有一个！\n他轻轻扣打额头，问道：“长风，你说如果现在的洪门和青帮打起来，谁会赢？”\n节选正文：谢文东仰面想了想，话锋一转，道：“既然韩非不在，打起来也没什么意思，这段时间，我刚好可以去趟日本。”\n东心雷惊讶道：“东哥要去日本，去做干什么？”\n谢文东一笑，道：“去见一个人。”“谁？”“李威！”\n日本洪门不象中国洪门，有南、北、香港、台湾之分，十分统一，全日本就只有一个洪门，只是在实力上，日本洪门在日本黑帮里还算不上一流的帮派。\n因为杀光李白山全家这件事，谢文东对李威的印象大打折扣，但不喜欢并不代表不接触，毕竟李威是日本洪门的老大，能用到他的地方还会很多。\n谢文东这次去日本，带的人并不少，除了五行兄弟和格桑这六位贴身保镖之外，还有新加入麾下的杰克以及姜森、任长风、血杀的精锐人员，毕竟日本是山口组的地头，他和山口组的关系又很僵，不得不做足准备，以防不测。\n对于谢文东的拜访，李威十分高兴，亲自带人去东京机场迎接，也算给足了谢文东面子。\n两人在机场见面之后，先是热情地相互拥抱一下，接下来，自然少不了一番客套的场面话，由于双方老大的态度亲密，场面中的气氛也很融洽，出了机场，坐上汽车，李威直接把谢文东送到自己的郊外住所。\n李威所住的别墅面积非常大，即使在位置在郊区，也可谓是豪宅了。别墅内除了一栋三层的楼房外，还有硕大的后花园，足有大半个足球场大，里面不仅有假山、草坪，还有一座游泳池和温泉。\n当谢文东到时，别墅里已聚集了不少人，大多都是四十左右的中年人，一各个白白胖胖，有西装革履的，也有穿大花衬衫的。这些人，随便挑出一个都是日本华人黑道中有头有脸的人物，不是帮主，就是会长。\n\n[要求]

\n他让一个家族的姓氏,成为一个帝国的旗号！\n踏过时空的界限，抛却身份的束缚，引领着一个曾经辉煌的家族走上又一个辉煌的顶点，做一件骨子里想实现的事情。\n怒目扬眉，凭借未知的三根金指，在动乱的四国、勾心斗角的九大世家以及名贯。\n天下的十方名将之间谋得他应有的地位。\n\n\n作品相关\n\n\n番外篇\n花非花，雾非雾，茫茫之中自有销魂处\n燕历平光XX年，天下大定。\n不过，虽说天下大定，可有些地方还是不怎么平稳。但是，总得来说并无有太大的匪事兵乱，百姓尚算安居乐业，倒也安稳。\n红枫镇，燕国之中的一个小小城镇。人口寥寥数千。此处民风淳朴，各家各户都以打猎为生。其实说它是一个镇，倒不如将它称之为一个村子来的合适。而它之所以会被称之为红枫镇，乃是因为这个镇子的周围，还有旁边的山上都是红枫树。每到秋季漫天遍野都是火红色的红枫，如火般红艳，将整个镇子笼罩在其中，显得这个镇子妩媚如韵味十足的少女，格外的迷人。\n故此成名，被人称之为红枫镇。\n时值秋季，傍晚时分。晕红的夕阳西陲落幕，将天地都笼上了一层朦朦的色彩，尤其醉人。红枫镇十里外，一处布局古韵清雅的小庄园中。此庄园里跟别的地方一样，种满了红枫。只见那似火红艳的红枫树下宛然立着一人。一个发丝如墨，白衣似雪，身形玲珑，容貌绝色，浑身散发着一股清雅气息的女子。\n只是，绝色女子一袭白衣，发丝如墨，本应是一个清姣绝艳的女子。可是，在那落幕夕阳下和红枫树的衬托之下，竟是生生地生出了几分妩媚妖艳的美感。就宛如一株鲜艳似血的曼陀罗花，开在了清澈的水中，美到极致，艳到了极致，媚到了十分，让人望而心迷，近而失魂。让清醒者看着就会恨不能将她牢牢地禁锢在怀里，再也不放手。\n事实上，也确实正有人在这么做。\n但见一阵清风吹起，吹起了满地落叶红枫，漫天飞舞不停，遮住了人的视线，一时间什么都看不清。\n片刻，待那风停，落叶重归于地的时候，白衣女子已被人抱在了怀中。那是一个青年男子。男子容貌俊美无俦，身姿健硕挺拔，气质贵雅不凡，眉目间流转间在看向怀中女子的时候，溢满了似水柔情。\n看着这个男子，绝色女子那犹如凝脂般的脸庞上氤氲而起一抹淡粉晕红。她轻启朱唇，美目中蕴含点点娇羞，欲说还休地看着男子，似是想说什么，却终是没有说出口……\n见她这般，俊美男子的眸底划过一道温柔却炽热的光芒，他左手揽着女子的腰身，右手轻柔地抚上了女子的朱唇。轻轻地摩擦着，他说道：“你可知我等这一天等了多久……我本以为你我之间会永无交际，我早已经打算用我自己的方式来守护你。直到你我死去。”话锋一转，俊美男子的语气变得有些低沉：“可是，天怜你我。到头来我终是掌握住了我的命运，推翻了命运。从此以后，再无人能左右我，也无人能伤得了你。你……可开心？”\n青年男子说这句话的时候，有些小心翼翼地样子。却也是心中在乎，所以不能做到像对外人那般的无所顾忌，狠厉无情。\n爱，深深地爱，所以，才会将对方的喜怒哀乐放在心头。\n俊美男子的话让绝色女子那双如琉璃般美丽的眼眸中染起了一抹特别复杂的色彩。似爱恋，似挣扎，似惶恐，似……最后，她睫毛轻颤，眯上了眼睛。但是，她那朱红唇瓣轻启，却颤颤地吐出了几个字：“漠儿……不值……为了我……不值……不值……”说着，两行晶莹清泪从她的眼角滚落，一滴滴落在了俊美男子的衣袖上……。\n惹得俊美男子那双深邃如海的眼眸越发幽暗，他动作极其轻柔地将唇贴上了女子的眼角，允掉了她眼角的泪珠。他的这个动作让绝色女子猛然睁开了双眼。她的双眼中闪烁着一种名为震惊的色彩……她语气轻颤的叫道：“韩漠…你…！”也不难怪她会这般，因为过去的时间里，她和他一直都是以礼相处。从未逾越底线。\n也正是她这一声惊呼，将俊美男子的身份托然而出，此男子正是韩漠。而这白衣女子，宛然就是已然‘死’去了一年之久的苏玉碧，被韩府人称‘碧姨娘’！！\n过往如烟，暂且不提。\n碧姨娘这副震惊如斯的表情让韩漠环抱她腰身的手臂紧了紧。只见韩漠深深地凝视着她，缓而不慢的说道：“值与不值，并不是由别人说了算，也不是你说了就能算。我只知我心中有你，认定了你，这就足矣！至于其他的，不在我的考虑范围内。”\n“一年，现在已经整整一年。我已经没有办法再去等待一年。给我一个结果。这样的生活你开不开心，想不想要。要不要一直这样下去！若是你不要，那么，我绝不会再出现你的面前。我会转身离去！若是想要，那么，我韩漠就此起誓，绝不负你！在世人舆论下，我不能给予你光明正大的身份，可我！！却会给予你唯一！一生的唯一！”\n“现在，在最短的时间里把你的答案告诉我。不要去担心别的，问问你自己的心，你想要什么。”\n要什么？碧姨娘一时慌乱无章，不知该怎么说。不知怎么说，正是因为灵魂深处早已根深蒂固地种下了一些东西。没有办法冲破，没有勇气去打碎。纵是心底很想回答‘要’，却没勇气诉说出来。\n久久……亦或者只是片刻。在碧姨娘天人交战的时候，韩漠突然松开了环抱着她腰身的手臂。背对她，韩漠语气‘忧伤’的说道：“我懂了……你不必为难。从今以后我不会再出现在这里。我会如你所愿，让你安静地生活下去……保重……”\n嘴上这么说，韩漠却在心中暗道：如果你没有勇气来打破它，那么，就让我来打破吧。只要能跟你在一起，我并不介意说一回谎话，做一次戏。\n这么想着，韩漠转身就要‘离去’。却被一双柔荑紧紧抱住，属于碧姨娘那娇柔动听的声音从他背后传来。\n“漠儿……不要……不要走……我……我……我……我……”断断续续半天，碧姨娘也没说出接下来的话。\n韩漠却已经得到想要的东西。他唇角微微上翘，说了一句：“无悔？”\n一瞬间，碧姨娘仿佛看透了一些什么，她柔柔地说道：“不悔……”说完，她的脸颊在韩漠的后背蹭了蹭。\n感受到触及后背的那两个温暖的柔软，一股火气从韩漠体内升起。苦苦压抑了许久的火焰就这么激烈迸发，他忽然转身把她紧紧地抱住，狠狠地吻上了她的唇。直至将她吻得气喘吁吁，双颊红晕，美目中情慾水雾骤起，他方才松开她的唇。紧接，他把她拦腰抱起，飞身进了屋子……\n片刻……屋内欢泣呻吟起，夹杂着男子的粗喘呼吸……一切组合成了一曲扉靡无比的乐曲……却不觉淫靡，反令人心生温馨……\n……小小三粉著\n\n\n关于三根金手指\n    三根金手指的设定，带有一定的玄幻色彩，当初也有不少人就此议论，褒贬不一，但是我最终还是用上了。\n一指自救，一指杀敌，最后一指并没有用上，但是我相信韩漠终究会用上，全书完本的时候，他的生命才走到了一小半，在他往后的生涯中，必然不会是一帆风顺，也必然还会遇到许多的难题，而保留的一根金手指追随他，也就等于是一个希望在追随他。\n所以我愿意将第三根金手指成为希望的手指。\n并非是故作深沉，也不是自以为很有哲理，但是沙漠确实想说，你我同是生活在这个时代，或许会遇到许多的挫折困难，甚至会遇到太多的不平，但是我们心中都该保有希望，而希望的保留，是让我们在人生道路上继续前进的神秘动力。\n一直以来，我对自己的未来生活充满着希望和自信，有了希望的信念，才会让自己的每一步走的很轻松很大气。\n\n\n关于十方名将\n    十方名将是本书设定的一个重要因素，也可说为全书增色不少。\n不少朋友深有怨念，觉得全书完本了，却还没有将十方名将完全摆出来，但是沙漠想笑问一声，真的需要摆出来吗？\n甚至有人觉得这也是烂尾因素之一。\n或许不少人觉得故事戛然而止，会有一种猝然感，由此而产生烂尾之感，这个我都能理解，但是如果说十方名将没有清晰摆出来就算是烂尾，那我实在不敢苟同。\n在朝五大名将，我们都已经十分清楚，而在野名将，本就是一种神秘感。\n我想说明的，无非是这天底下这样一群才干之士，他们的人生价值取向不同，有的固然愿意成为国家的骨干，建功立业，定国安邦，但是却有一类人却有着自己的价值观，愿意泯然众人，过着自己想要的生活。\n在朝的名将固然值得尊敬，但是在野的名将依然值得钦佩。\n在野的名将，以他们的能力，想要求得荣华富贵，当然是易如反掌，但是他们却舍却荣华富贵，只为自己的理念和价值去活，这当然是一种十分正确的人生价值观。\n浮躁的社会，以金钱至上的社会变的喧嚣无比，那么是否所有的人都该在金钱权势之中翻滚？是否还能有人坚守着自己的某一种理想，以自己的生活方式去生活？\n虽然如今很难看到这种人，但是不可否认，在我们中国五千年的文明进程中，这类人曾经拥有许多，而他们的故事和处世哲理，后辈还是愿意回忆一下。\n所以这些人代表的只是一种隐士，他们不被框架束缚，代表的是一个稀少的群体。\n在野的名将，书中自然已经展现了不少，但是究竟谁才是真正的在野五大名将，我相信每个人都有自己的理解。\n\n\n关于写作\n    2009年的一个偶然机会，一个无聊的在业青年感觉生活乏味，又仗着自以为能书三分墨的本事，也自以为是地到了某点开始写书，当时满腔志气，觉得某人一出谁与争锋，在某点发文三万多字，成绩惨淡，正要罢笔远离此行，却不曾想天降贵人。\n纵横当时处于发展时期，编辑“落焰”姐姐找上了这个即将放弃写作的小瘪三，诚意邀请来纵横发展，虽然开出的是白菜价，但是这位小瘪三自觉地有伯乐降临，激动无比，愿追随“落焰”主公，作为马前卒，荡平四海，一统天下。\n    于是乎，某人第一部处女作《江山》开始在纵横连载，天马行空，完全没有网文经验的他在真正写书之后，才知道这行绝非想象的那般简单。\n从那时候起，此人日夜苦读，白天上班，晚上写字，由此拉开了屌丝的人生道路。\n其间，此人性格顽劣，屡次招惹事端，甚至没来由地被一些别有居心者诬陷坑害，遂明白世事不简单，在主公的教诲下，那张向来没有把门的大嘴开始安静，当初的少年心性也开始在主公的耐心教诲下，开始变得成熟起来，不招惹是非，只知道埋头长进自己，好好写书。\n

   三根金手指的设定，带有一定的玄幻色彩，当初也有不少人就此议论，褒贬不一，但是我最终还是用上了。\n一指自救，一指杀敌，最后一指并没有用上，但是我相信韩漠终究会用上，全书完本的时候，他的生命才走到了一小半，在他往后的生涯中，必然不会是一帆风顺，也必然还会遇到许多的难题，而保留的一根金手指追随他，也就等于是一个希望在追随他。\n所以我愿意将第三根金手指成为希望的手指。\n并非是故作深沉，也不是自以为很有哲理，但是沙漠确实想说，你我同是生活在这个时代，或许会遇到许多的挫折困难，甚至会遇到太多的不平，但是我们心中都该保有希望，而希望的保留，是让我们在人生道路上继续前进的神秘动力。\n一直以来，我对自己的未来生活充满着希望和自信，有了希望的信念，才会让自己的每一步走的很轻松很大气。\n\n\n关于十方名将\n    十方名将是本书设定的一个重要因素，也可说为全书增色不少。\n不少朋友深有怨念，觉得全书完本了，却还没有将十方名将完全摆出来，但是沙漠想笑问一声，真的需要摆出来吗？\n甚至有人觉得这也是烂尾因素之一。\n或许不少人觉得故事戛然而止，会有一种猝然感，由此而产生烂尾之感，这个我都能理解，但是如果说十方名将没有清晰摆出来就算是烂尾，那我实在不敢苟同。\n在朝五大名将，我们都已经十分清楚，而在野名将，本就是一种神秘感。\n我想说明的，无非是这天底下这样一群才干之士，他们的人生价值取向不同，有的固然愿意成为国家的骨干，建功立业，定国安邦，但是却有一类人却有着自己的价值观，愿意泯然众人，过着自己想要的生活。\n在朝的名将固然值得尊敬，但是在野的名将依然值得钦佩。\n在野的名将，以他们的能力，想要求得荣华富贵，当然是易如反掌，但是他们却舍却荣华富贵，只为自己的理念和价值去活，这当然是一种十分正确的人生价值观。\n浮躁的社会，以金钱至上的社会变的喧嚣无比，那么是否所有的人都该在金钱权势之中翻滚？是否还能有人坚守着自己的某一种理想，以自己的生活方式去生活？\n虽然如今很难看到这种人，但是不可否认，在我们中国五千年的文明进程中，这类人曾经拥有许多，而他们的故事和处世哲理，后辈还是愿意回忆一下。\n所以这些人代表的只是一种隐士，他们不被框架束缚，代表的是一个稀少的群体。\n在野的名将，书中自然已经展现了不少，但是究竟谁才是真正的在野五大名将，我相信每个人都有自己的理解。\n\n\n关于写作\n    2009年的一个偶然机会，一个无聊的在业青年感觉生活乏味，又仗着自以为能书三分墨的本事，也自以为是地到了某点开始写书，当时满腔志气，觉得某人一出谁与争锋，在某点发文三万多字，成绩惨淡，正要罢笔远离此行，却不曾想天降贵人。\n纵横当时处于发展时期，编辑“落焰”姐姐找上了这个即将放弃写作的小瘪三，诚意邀请来纵横发展，虽然开出的是白菜价，但是这位小瘪三自觉地有伯乐降临，激动无比，愿追随“落焰”主公，作为马前卒，荡平四海，一统天下。\n    于是乎，某人第一部处女作《江山》开始在纵横连载，天马行空，完全没有网文经验的他在真正写书之后，才知道这行绝非想象的那般简单。\n从那时候起，此人日夜苦读，白天上班，晚上写字，由此拉开了屌丝的人生道路。\n其间，此人性格顽劣，屡次招惹事端，甚至没来由地被一些别有居心者诬陷坑害，遂明白世事不简单，在主公的教诲下，那张向来没有把门的大嘴开始安静，当初的少年心性也开始在主公的耐心教诲下，开始变得成熟起来，不招惹是非，只知道埋头长进自己，好好写书。\n    《江山》写完，一百八十万字落幕，此人获益良多，终于明白自己的诸多缺陷，但是从中也开始学会了如何构制框架，如何将一本书形成一个整体。\n节选正文：“你姐姐捎回来的？”杨焦冷笑道：“京里有东西过来，都是要从我这个村长手里过，是要检查的，你姐姐捎回来的银子，我怎么没见过？这是不是那两个奸细收买你的银子？好啊，你这死丫头胆子倒大，与敌国奸细勾结……”\n“我没有！”燕儿眼圈泛红：“就是我姐姐捎回来的，他们是我姐姐的朋友，不是奸细……而且，而且我们一个小小的村子，你……你说的奸细往这里来做什么……”\n燕儿知道杨焦的花招，但凡要整治村里的村民，动不动就抬出“奸细”这一套说辞。\n其实对于这些普通百姓来说，“奸细”这个词实在很陌生。\n杨焦恶狠狠地道：“你还狡辩，这村里上下什么事儿我不知道，无缘无故来两个人陌生人，又给你修房子又给你留银子，若不是想从你口里得到些东西，他们凭什么对你这么好？你姐姐去的地儿，怎会有人来看你一个死丫头，你可知道你姐姐到的是什么地儿？谅你也不知道……”伸出手来，道：“把银子给我，我要交给官府，查查看这些银子的真实来历……”\n燕儿立刻摇头道：“不行，这……这是我姐姐捎回来的，我不能给你……”\n杨焦凶狠狠地上前来，一脚踹向燕儿，燕儿虽然想躲开，还是被踹到腰儿，她身子弱得很，这一踹，顿时便倒在地上，杨焦恶狼般上前，从燕儿手里抢过燕子，揣进怀里，凶神恶煞地道：“不识抬举的死丫头，你还要不要命？和我作对，能有你好果子吃。惹恼了我，将你和你那瘸了腿的娘赶出村子，饿死在外面……”"}
{"id": 152, "category": "refactor", "type": "Style Conversion", "lang": "cn", "task": "[指令] 这里是一篇小说: \n我是唐朝的最大纨绔子弟。\n我是唐朝的皇太子。\n我是武则天的长子，有可能被母亲第一个干掉的儿子。\n（重要提示，还原当时真实历史，所以有后宫、萝莉养成、御姐控……，不喜欢的，请莫进入）\n\n\n\n【作品相关】关于本书中几个疑问：\n写到了现在，让有些人出现了一些困惑。比如我说刺杀，为什么不立即处死贺兰敏之。我在书中说了，太子不死，贺兰未必会死。有一点可以考证，太平公主出事大约可能在四月或者五月份。太子妃出事有可能在三月份或更早。太子妃有绝色，相信太子肯定不会不喜的，知道此事后，会有什么样的反应？然而真相呢？太子妃出事，贺兰敏之却是平安无事的。连一句斥责的话都没有。\n我细心地寻找答案。难道李治如此麻木？好歹也是自己的儿媳妇。如果说对贞操一点不再乎，何必拒之，改选了裴家女？既然再乎了，为什么不处执贺兰敏之？于是再看史书。看到了一段。魏国夫人死的时候，贺兰入吊，李治哭泣地与他说话。虽然说古人泪花儿特别多，可让一个皇帝哭泣，还不是年老无用的皇帝哭泣，那是超级大臣的待遇。比如李绩，魏征，于是好奇地再翻李绩死时的事，李绩死了，李治果然哭了，缀朝七天。但贺兰氏是什么人，一个小姑娘而己！可见在李治心中的地位。爱屋及乌总归有的。而且李治很好色的，不然武则天还是一个尼姑儿。所以呢，对贺兰敏之也是纵容的。这一点从后来处理也可以看出。太平公主出事了，才多大一点。可是李治最喜欢的小女儿。只是流放！还是武则天暴怒，下的圣旨，连暴自家丑事，包括母亲的事，公告天下，逼迫李治处执贺兰的，在半路上，武则天心中不平，将贺兰做掉了。但不是圣旨处死的。\n很荒唐是吧。但确实是事实。\n所以后人对这位贺兰氏多有传说。梁羽生小说中有贺兰烟。有人说是贺兰敏之姐姐，也不大可能的。贺兰氏得宠时，她还没有嫁人，贺兰敏之都二十岁略略出头了。正常女子嫁人是十五岁。因此是妹妹。当然，这是我的推测了。\n再说武则天、李弘与李治的三角关系。对李弘的培养，李治很重视的，也多次让他监国。然后后来太子渐长时，李治又担心了，自己又有病，舍不得放权。于是将政权多交给武则天处理。看到武则天重了，又分权给李弘。搞平衡。搞出了事了。然后是李弘与武则天，最爱李弘的不是李治，是武则天。大约是因为女儿的死，武则天小时候对李弘很关爱。然而让崇文馆一群大儒们教傻了。李弘长大后，多次忤逆武则天的意思。\n太子弘和武后之间的分歧由来已久。早在咸亨二年二圣幸东都，留太子弘监国，戴至德、张文瓘两位宰相辅政，这是弘第五次奉诏留京监国，时天下大旱已久，关中饥馑，二圣东巡当与就食于漕运便利的洛阳有关。弘身体病弱，政事多委决于两位宰相，自己四处出巡，体察民情，见有兵卒的食粮里有树皮和草籽，便吩咐人把自己仓库里的米分发给穷人。这日游历宫禁，不料却见到长期幽禁在掖庭的两位异母姐姐，也就是萧淑妃的二女义阳公主和宣城公主。因为母亲的缘故，她们一直无声无息地拘禁在后宫里，早已被人遗忘，虽然早已成人，却仍未嫁人。弘惊讶而又不安，立即奏请让两位姐姐出嫁，同时希望能将父皇同洲沙苑的空地出借给穷人耕种，二事合为一书，快马报至东都。\n弘不是第一次做这种事情，当初废太子忠以谋反罪被杀的时候，他也曾奏请为哥哥收尸下葬，武后也曾微笑着附和高宗称赞弘的仁厚，但这次她可笑不出来了。毕竟废太子忠是高宗下令杀的，而两位公主长期未嫁却直指是她这个后宫女主人失职。当时的武后，地位并不稳固，前一年才在重压下递交了后位辞呈，正是需要花心思讨好高宗的时候，李弘此举让她着实尴尬。而李弘监国竟然让宰相掌政，自己四处巡游亲民扮菩萨状，也让武后觉得儿子摆明收买人心，故意让人看清母亲的刻薄来衬托他的仁慈。弘的请求占尽道理，无可拒绝，诏令一并准奏。愤怒而无从发泄的武后，当即将两位公主随便指给殿前当值的翊卫权毅和王勖，草草完婚。事后，武后也觉不妥，于是主动为两位公主请封，表现出嫡母的大度风范，然而弘这一举动给她带来的难堪却久久难以忘怀。史载，弘“由是失爱于天后”。\n这一故事被后来的史家渲染得十分精彩，两位公主的年龄一说“年逾三十而不嫁”（《资治通鉴》），一说“四十不嫁”（《新唐书》），乍一看真以为就算不到四十岁，至少也有三十七八，的确太不人道了。可是仔细一想就有点不对头了，咸亨二年高宗自己都才43岁，怎么会有这么大的两个女儿？义阳公主不察，宣城公主的墓志铭至今留存，明载她以高安长公主的封号卒于开元二年，享年66岁。那么倒推到咸亨二年，宣城公主应为23岁。义阳公主略大，大概25、26岁左右。司马光和欧阳修都是出名治史严谨的饱学宿儒，却不愿意花一点点时间做一道简单的数学题，特别是司马光，还特意把此事记于上元二年条，有意将此事与李弘暴卒拉上联系，实在令人叹息。《资治通鉴》里关于高宗后期的年代记载多有失误，如高宗曾经打算让天后摄知国事，因中书令郝处俊力谏，中书侍郎、同中书门下三品李义琰声援，高宗才打消此念。此事唐书明载于上元三年李弘去世后，而据通鉴，李义琰也是仪凤元年（即上元三年，公元676年，高宗武后朝改元比较频繁）四月才迁为同中书门下三品，位列宰相，得以参与讨论国事。司马光却将此事记于上元二年三月，诸般铺垫准备停当之后，才呛讫咧哋呛讫咧哋地隆重推出上元二年四月，“太子薨于合璧宫，时人以为天后鸩之也。”个中苦心，颇令人玩味。\n这是摘自《武则天传》中的一段话，未必全对，但比较中肯了。\n再说太平公主，史书说那次事是太平公主的宫女。太子妃出事了，都不处理，难道为了一个宫女处理贺兰敏之？不过大兴唐书友群中，原原说了一个理由，有可能是矛盾积累起来的，宫女只是一个引子。这也有可能，但太平公主本人出事的可能性绝对是百分之五十。总之，从招惑太子妃起，贺兰敏之已经是病态了。为什么，书中已经解释过了。\n再分析杨家女，绝色勿用置疑。亲戚关系书中也说过。史书说是强奸导致的。为什么有通奸的来历？一是贺兰敏之的人才与太子的肺结核，一对比，让人容易想入非非，第二贺兰就是病态了，难道真不想到后果？于是又翻史书慢慢看。看杨家的家谱，看事前事后的反应。杨思俭一家自此以后，没有人为官了。恐怕受此牵连的。但并没有处理杨思俭本人。又看到了一件事，后来武则天想用外戚，于是用了杨执柔为相。杨执柔与杨思俭乃是一个血脉后代。虽然这样解释有些牵强。那么再说呢，贺兰敏之年近三十，肯定有妻子了。难道杨家女那么放荡。如果是如此，事后为什么为处理她家人？所以我用了书中的说法，杨家缺少了管制一部分，亲戚间来往给了贺兰敏之机会一部分。杨家女未必那么可恶的。通奸也未必成立的。\n以上是个人见解，仁者见仁，智者见智。老午不是历史学家，又用了我的想法，去拉开这本小说的序幕，也许错误了，还请大家一笑了之。（但有可能垂涎太子妃的美色，是主要原因，报复未必。但太平公主的事，如果是事实，那么报复则是主要原因了。历史啊，真相很难确定的）\n\n【作品相关】一些重要历史人物介绍：\n可恨可怜的武则天：对这个人物，我在书评里开了长篇的评论，小说中也说了一些。走上女皇之路，心狠手辣，绝不是偶然的，从小的欺侮，后宫的厮杀，大臣的鄙视弹压，儿子的仇怨，侄女侄子的背叛，于是天地间只剩下我一个人了。女皇之路开始。大家看这本小说时，不要纠缠于后来的武则天，必须从现在的武则天分析起。心中还有那么一丝丝亲情的，尽管变得很弱。对权利心的渴望并不会停息的。这就是现在的武则天。\n低估的皇帝李治：武则天所谓的神马功绩，一大半是李治留下的底子，当然武则天从中的协助，功不可没。总的说来，还不错，但不能说他柔弱，也杀人，亲戚，大臣，杀掉的还不少。对儿子心里很矛盾，又想放权，又想抓权，于是一度对长子与次子，是进行过培养，还分给他们处理一些小朝政的权利。可是又分权给武则天。可从李贤起，他已经渐渐失去对朝堂控制了。李贤被流，眼睁睁地看着，无能为力。李显上位了，急忙册立皇太孙。但也不能说李治无能，都低估了武则天，当时的戴至德，甚至郝处俊公开反对武则天当权。但都低估了武则天的手腕。所以说不是李治无能，是武则天手腕太厉害了。\n阴柔的仁太子李弘：几个皇太子当中，给老妈危胁最大的是病怏怏的大儿子，一度差点将武则天弄下台。仁爱确实，可也不能说他无用，小刀子割得很厉害的，一刀刀子，割得武则天后来几年十分难受。最后病死，但司马光说是武则天害死的，可能性百分之二十到百分之三十。\n夸夸其谈的李贤：不是说他不好，文学很好，可是做事急燥，这一点比他大哥，差得很远了。立为太子后，开宗立府，拉帮结派，亲自修书扬名，明崇俨是武则天授意说那番话的，立即被李贤干掉了。急吼吼的做派，为自己埋下祸根。有人说他的黄豆诗，写得不错。但这首黄台诗要看人的。曹槽五步诗，必死。李贤黄台诗，必死！评论里我说过此原因了。但让李泌拿出来救了时为太子的唐代宗一命。\n前后截然不同的李显：前期的李显刚而无谋，还不错，保住了一条命。可是吓傻了。后来韦氏的事，成为千古笑柄。\n打太极的李旦：李显在房州吓傻了，还没有李旦受的罪多。他就在深宫，皇后娘家人干掉了，妃子娘家人干掉了，亲眼看着妻子被杀，却笑着面对武则天，就是这样了，活了下来，睿智不减，这算是一个奇迹了。可是让武则天将锐气磨平了。于是看着儿子与妹妹对牛，最后将权利乖乖交出来。\n无奈的裴行俭：看这个人的历史，我时常怀疑他是一个穿越者，比袁天罡还妖异。但就是这样的一个妖人，因为不喜武则天，让武则天拉拢程务挺等将领，生生架空了他的军权。而程务挺却是裴行俭一手提拨上来的，最后程大将军也让武则天做掉了，是不是因果报应？或者说，武则天是不是更妖？\n唯一让武则天忌惮的刘仁轨：老将军后来在唐朝地位很高的。武则天废李显，渐渐走向女皇之路时，唯一安慰的大臣就是刘仁轨。多次派人宣抚。因为刘仁轨一句话，就杀掉了自己手下得力大将姜嗣宗。\n唯一让武则天上当的狄仁杰：武则天晚年渐渐改掉了暴戾，得亏此人。不但如此，提出了许多朝政，将武周从越行越远的道路上拉了回来。不过他的从容布局，让李显得保皇太子，又拉了张柬之等人上台，为后来的神龙政局打下了基础。不过上台后的李显，与武则天相比，差得太远了。这一点不知道狄仁杰会不会知道？\n心冷掉了魏元忠：老魏同志是一个好人，数次三番因为直谏，被流放，杀一点人头落地。终于熬到他梦想的，李唐王室上台了，可是李显的做派，让他寒心了。于是沉默不言。后来史书因此怦击他，不是他不想言，心冷掉了。但就是这样，也没有逃过噩运。\n凄凉富贵梦的贺兰敏之：站在太子的立场，他很可恨。其实很可怜，相依为命的母亲妹妹死得不明不白。而武则天留下他活下来原因，正是因为满足九十高龄母亲那些欲望。荣国夫人一死，也许自知末日将要到来，于是变得丧心病狂。当然，死得很惨。\n\n【作品相关】关于青海之战各地名路线释疑：\n地名主要参考了严耕望的《唐代交通会考》。但不是仅是这本书，手中的《吐蕃史》等相关的史书大约有十几本，咱写的是小说，不是论文，不一一细说。\n另外说的是一件事，这些大部头论文中，多有冲突之处，自己又考了一番，包括从百度上看了许多资料，手中的一些资料书籍，以及看了相关的地图。有许多地方必然也错误了，大家原谅一下。主要认真的考据一下，让大家产生代入感，也尽量使小说战争写得更合理一点。\n分成四部分来说。\n节选篇章：仁太子的啥，李威根本没有当一回事。即使他真能做成皇帝，对吐蕃也要早迟痛打的，但不是这时候，最好弄死论钦陵，然后再调兵遣将。这个想法不能说的。道：“急的不是我们唐朝，是你们王室。来，孤拿两本书给你看。”\n说着，来到书架前，先找出一本《晋书》，这是房玄龄、上官仪、李义府、许敬宗、李淳风等二十一个大佬编写的。文字很简练，可是书的质量嘛，不提也罢。居然连《搜神记》的内容都当作史料记载进去。\n不过这无关紧要，在里面又翻了翻。竹纸出来了，可才出来没有多久，活字印刷更不提。因此，寝殿书房里的书除了极少数是雕版印刷的，大多数是用手誊抄的，甚至还有少量是竹简书。因此，很厚，这些史书都分成了一个个小册子。\n在里面将《王敦桓温列传》抽出来。然后又来到《宋书》前面，将里面的《本纪第一武帝上》与《本纪第一武帝中》抽了出来，还有一个下，不需要了，没有抽。\n然后将三本小册子递到没禄氏面前，说道：“看

看。”\n没禄氏翻看起来，李威一边咬着胡饼，喝着小米粥，一边看她的脸色，越看她脸色越不对劲。要的就是这个效果。自古以来，害怕大臣功高震主而杀害大臣的事例，在史书能找到很多。不仅是中原，吐蕃也是，欧洲也有。\n等她翻到最后一页，李威也吃饱了。丢下筷子，问道：“有什么感想？或者说噶尔家族象这三人中的那一个？”\n“那又如何，我们赞普不是东晋那些无用的皇帝。”"}

\n吉乐岛，位于太平洋，本来是一处没有人烟的荒岛，可是在最近一段时间，却突然兴旺起来。\n因为有个人把它买了下来，这个人就是谢文东。\n吉乐岛以前叫什么名字，他不知道，也不想知道，现在，他把它改名为吉乐，这是他和他的亲人、朋友的吉乐地带。\n谢文东到这里度假，或者说到这里来避难，已经有几个月的时间，过着神仙般的生活。\n在吉乐岛上，他并不寂寞，他的家人，他喜爱的人，都在这里，当然，也不缺少他的朋友。\n当谢文东初次来吉乐岛时，这还是一处未进行任何过开发的未知领域，当然，只要有钱，世界上没有多少事是办不成的。\n他在这里新建了第一栋别墅。很快，他的得力部下，也是他的兄弟，李爽也来了，而且不是一个人，还带来了他的家人。他对谢文东说：“这个小岛太荒凉，让伯父伯母两位老两口住在这里孤单寂寞，所以把自己家人带来，是为了让伯父伯母能找到说话谈心的人。”他的鬼心眼哪能瞒过谢文东的眼睛，傻子都知道，他在黑道混，怕仇家找上自己的家人，与其在中国过提心吊胆的日子，还不如到吉乐岛过无忧无虑、舒心的生活。而且别看李爽平时傻糊糊的，心里精明的很，他明白一个道理，谢文东在的地方，一定很安全，家人到这生活，一定不会出事。\n不管李爽是怎么打算的，谢文东欣然接受，在自家别墅旁边，又新建一栋。\n竣工之后，李爽高高兴兴把自己家人送过来，搬进别墅里。他在吉乐岛住了半个月时间，受不了这里无聊的生活，和谢文东打声招呼，又回中国了。\n李爽开了个好头！他是第一个，很快高强也来了。高强为人寡言，不象李爽那么能胡诌，当谢文东问他原因时，他只说两个字：“安全！”\n短短几个月时间，原本荒凉的小岛变的热闹起来，大兴土木，施工不断，刚开始的一栋别墅也变成现在近二十栋之多，文东会和原北洪门的许多骨干都效仿李爽和高强，把家人送到吉乐岛。\n谢文东原本以为自己可以在吉乐岛上安安稳稳地享受一段平静的生活，哪想到几个月下来，自己快变成‘包工头’了。\n白天，海边的沙滩上总是能看到身穿游装的中年男人在晒太阳，即使到晚上，时常也有大规模的聚会。\n当任长风来吉乐岛之前，一度以为谢文东在此地过着的是枯涩日子，可是当他坐着直升飞机，快接近目的地时，被岛上那一片花花绿绿的别墅吓了一跳，特别是在岛屿另一侧，竟然还兴建了一座码头，码头边旁若无人的停靠着一艘小型军舰。\n直升飞机缓缓停在岛屿东侧的停机坪上，他弯腰跳下飞机，终于看到多日未见、朝思暮想的谢文东。\n任长风为人清高，性格向来孤傲，除了他自己，能被他放在眼中的没几个，谢文东绝对是那没几个里的重中之重。\n没等说话，他眼圈一红，眼中先一片晶莹，双唇蠕动，一肚子话此时却一个字都说不出来。\n谢文东很喜欢任长风这个人，第一，他能力出众，本事过人，若论单打独斗，无论是北洪门还是文东会，每几个人能与他匹敌，第二，他的性情也十分让谢文东欣赏。\n见到他，谢文东当然甚是高兴，不等任长风说话，先笑眯眯地把他拉上一辆敞棚的吉普车，笑道：“有话，我们回家再说！”\n任长风坐上车，偷眼打量身旁的谢文东。他还是老样子，没什么太多变化，相貌依然清秀，身材依然消瘦，细长的眼睛弯弯的眯缝着，若说有变化，是他面颊比以前红润了一些，看起来更加健康。\n“我的变化大吗？”谢文东靠着椅子，仰面望天，笑眯眯地问道。他并没有看任长风，但却知道他在打量自己。\n唉！任长风叹口气，和东哥在一起，是毫无秘密而言的。很多没见过谢文东的人向他询问，谢文东究竟是什么样子的，他的回答是：“他有一双望穿秋水的眼睛，他有一种洞彻人心的眼神。”他笑道：“东哥的变化不大，看起来比以前更精神了。”\n“哈哈！”谢文东大笑，让任长风这样高傲的人说出恭维的话，无论怎么听都觉得别扭。\n任长风老脸一红，顿了一下，又道：“可是北洪门的变化太大了。”\n自谢文东走后，南北洪门停战，不久之后，达成联盟，虽然没有统一，但名称上已经没有南北之分，都叫洪门。\n至于盟主，由原南北洪门的老大共同担任。南洪门自然是向问天了，北洪门这边，由于谢文东出国，金老爷子退隐，一切都由东心雷做主，所以，洪门是由向问天和东心雷来主导。\n由于东心雷在智谋上弱于向问天，谢文东给他的建议是，他这个洪门老大只是名义上的，是为了安抚原北洪门的那些人，至于洪门大小的事务，应交由向问天做主。东心雷对谢文东的话言听计从，心甘情愿做了名义上的老大。现在的洪门，实际上是掌握在向问天的手里。而任长风做为原北洪门的骨干，和向问天争斗多年，从本质上，看不起他和南洪门那些干部，要他与这些人一起共事，对他来说实在是种煎熬。\n他这次来吉乐岛，就没打算回去。反正他孤家寡人一个，走到哪，哪就是家。\n谢文东知道他说的话是什么意思，别看他远离中国，但对洪门的事却了如指掌。他说道：“向问天是个英雄，把北洪门交给他，他不会排除异己，也不会生出事端，而且，以他的为人和能力，会把洪门带来一个好的发展前景。”\n任长风点点头，他心中也明白这个道理，可就是无法接受。\n吉普车在一座白色的别墅前停下，两人还没下车，已有四男两女从房中迎出来。\n任长风抬目一瞧，笑了，这六位他不仅认识，还是熟人。五行兄弟和小风，他自然不会陌生。\n见小风身着家居便装，腰间系围裙，一付家庭主妇的模样，任长风脸上笑容加深，半开玩笑道：“小风这身打扮倒是让人眼前一亮啊！”小风身为谢文东的贴身保镖，身手相当了得，别看人长得美艳漂亮，但动起手来，素有‘疯子’之称。\n小风撇撇嘴，白了他一眼，嘴唇挑了挑，不知道在嘟囔什么。\n任长风大笑两声，目光一转，打量起五行兄弟，这五人一各个红光满面，显然这一阵子睡得好，吃的香，没少享受清福。\n几人热情地打过招呼后，进入别墅。\n大厅内正有一条倩影在忙前忙后，向桌子上端饭菜，这位动人的女郎任长风也认识，她是彭玲。\n任长风没等脱鞋，先客客气气地叫一声：“嫂子好！”\n彭玲玉面一红，看看一旁的谢文东，招呼道：“快近来坐吧！”\n谢文东哈哈一笑，拍拍任长风肩膀，道：“别客气！”说着，来到彭玲身旁，笑呵呵看着桌上饭菜，笑道：“挺丰盛的嘛！”\n彭玲脸上露出妩媚的娇笑。高家两姐妹在中国读书，而金蓉在国外上学，平时照顾谢文东起居的都是彭玲，这段时间里，也是彭玲一直陪伴在他左右。\n任长风坐在沙发上，环视一圈，好奇地问道：“怎么没看到伯父伯母呢？”\n谢文东笑道：“我爸妈住在后面的别墅里。”\n“哦！”任长风点点头。谢文东又道：“你住的地方我也准备好了，一会带你去看看。”\n“谢谢！”任长风心中倍感温暖。\n“客气什么？！”谢文东笑道：“我们是兄弟嘛！”\n他一句简单的兄弟，却让任长风甚是受用。吃饭中，他想起自己来时看到的军舰，好奇地问道：“东哥，刚才我在飞机上，看到岛上还停有军舰，那是怎么回事？”\n谢文东大笑道：“那是我向黑带买的。本来想买艘游艇，可是黑带没有，就给我弄来一艘这个东西。”\n军舰？游艇？这完全是两种性质嘛！谢文东说的轻描淡写，但任长风却暗暗佩服，俄罗斯的军舰，可是一般人有钱都买不来的，虽然只是小型号的。\n水镜老神在在道：“我们现在都把它当游艇用，没事时可以用它出海钓鱼！”\n扑！任长风差点喷饭，用军舰钓鱼？还真是第一次听说过。\n吃过饭后，谢文东带任长风到海边散步，小风远远在后面跟着。\n夕阳西下，落日映红天边和海角，清新的海风迎面扑来，让人浑身凉爽，有种说不出的舒适。岛屿的宁静，环境的美丽，让长时间生活在喧嚣都市的任长风仿佛置身于世外逃园。\n踩着柔软的沙滩，任长风幽幽叹息一声，问道：“东哥打算回国吗？”\n谢文东停下脚步，面对大海，说道：“回去，是一定要回去的，但不是现在。”\n任长风精神一振，忙问道：“那是什么时候？”\n谢文东摇摇头，道：“我不知道！即使现在回去，恐怕也难有什么作为，南北洪门已经达成联盟，实际上已经是统一了，我回去，又能做些什么呢？”\n任长风道：“可以挤掉向问天！偌大的洪门，怎能让他一人独有！？”\n谢文东微微一笑，背手望着夕阳，轻声说道：“再耀眼的骄阳，也有落下来的时候，何况是人呢？”\n任长风琢磨着他的话，正想发问，谢文东转头问道：“听说，现在有崛起一个新帮派，叫青帮。”\n“是的！”任长风点头道：“他们自称祖师爷是杜月笙，在全国很多地方都设有分堂，只是东哥在时，他们还没有浮出水面，只是在东哥走后不久，青帮突然变的高调起来，最近，和台洪门闹的不可开交。”\n谢文东挑眉问道：“青帮的势力已延伸到台湾了？”\n任长风道：“他们在台湾确实有很大的分堂，有消息说，他们本来就是从台湾兴起的，后来才发展到大陆。不过，青帮的总部在中国，这倒是真的。”\n“恩！”谢文东仰面，心中默默琢磨着。任长风的话，和暗组给自己的消息基本上差不多，以此来看，洪门和青帮的碰撞是迟早的事情，毕竟中国只有一个，地下的皇帝也只能有一个！\n他轻轻扣打额头，问道：“长风，你说如果现在的洪门和青帮打起来，谁会赢？”\n再给出一段话：\n任长风冷笑道：“不知道他们以前和青帮作战是怎么打的？非要等到人家欺负到头上了，才开始知耻而后勇，真是一群笨蛋！”\n很快，灵敏又传来消息，称青帮有了移动，韩非正在调集人手。\n得知这一点，谢文东哈哈大笑，站起身形，整了整衣襟，说道：“该我们上场了！”\n东心雷等人一愣，惊道：“东哥，我们要向青帮动手吗？”\n谢文东摇摇头，笑眯眯地说道：“我们现在没钱和青帮斗，不过，可以邀请韩非去喝茶嘛！”\n众人眨眨眼睛，没明白谢文东的意思。\n韩非带人，一路直奔，飞快地向酒店赶。\n可是，车行过半，忽然前方道路停有数不清的汽车，几乎将整条道路都堵死，十数名交警正和二十多名大汉纠缠在一起，似乎在争议什么。\n韩非坐在车里，皱了皱眉头，现在时间紧张，早到酒店一秒，铁宁就多一分安全，可是，看前方堵塞的情况，不知道要什么时候能解决，他等不了那么久。\n他果断的下令，让车队向后退，绕道去酒店。\n但车队刚向后倒出没有五米，无数辆黑色轿车突然冲过来，将韩非车队的后路也完全堵死。\n韩非焦急地摇下车窗，向后张望，他脑袋刚探出来，正好看到后方的轿车车门一开，从里面走出一行人，为首的一位，正是谢文东。\n离老远，就见谢文东一手插在口袋里，一手背于身后，边向他这边走来，边笑眯眯地说道：“韩兄，好久不见，别来无恙？”\n第168章\n谢文东！看到他，韩非心中一颤，感觉事情麻烦了。他推开车门，刚要下车，身旁的智囊魏东东急忙拉住他，低声说道：“韩大哥，小心谢文东来者不善！”\n\n\n[要求]

\n他让一个家族的姓氏,成为一个帝国的旗号！\n踏过时空的界限，抛却身份的束缚，引领着一个曾经辉煌的家族走上又一个辉煌的顶点，做一件骨子里想实现的事情。\n怒目扬眉，凭借未知的三根金指，在动乱的四国、勾心斗角的九大世家以及名贯。\n天下的十方名将之间谋得他应有的地位。\n\n\n作品相关\n\n\n番外篇\n花非花，雾非雾，茫茫之中自有销魂处\n燕历平光XX年，天下大定。\n不过，虽说天下大定，可有些地方还是不怎么平稳。但是，总得来说并无有太大的匪事兵乱，百姓尚算安居乐业，倒也安稳。\n红枫镇，燕国之中的一个小小城镇。人口寥寥数千。此处民风淳朴，各家各户都以打猎为生。其实说它是一个镇，倒不如将它称之为一个村子来的合适。而它之所以会被称之为红枫镇，乃是因为这个镇子的周围，还有旁边的山上都是红枫树。每到秋季漫天遍野都是火红色的红枫，如火般红艳，将整个镇子笼罩在其中，显得这个镇子妩媚如韵味十足的少女，格外的迷人。\n故此成名，被人称之为红枫镇。\n时值秋季，傍晚时分。晕红的夕阳西陲落幕，将天地都笼上了一层朦朦的色彩，尤其醉人。红枫镇十里外，一处布局古韵清雅的小庄园中。此庄园里跟别的地方一样，种满了红枫。只见那似火红艳的红枫树下宛然立着一人。一个发丝如墨，白衣似雪，身形玲珑，容貌绝色，浑身散发着一股清雅气息的女子。\n只是，绝色女子一袭白衣，发丝如墨，本应是一个清姣绝艳的女子。可是，在那落幕夕阳下和红枫树的衬托之下，竟是生生地生出了几分妩媚妖艳的美感。就宛如一株鲜艳似血的曼陀罗花，开在了清澈的水中，美到极致，艳到了极致，媚到了十分，让人望而心迷，近而失魂。让清醒者看着就会恨不能将她牢牢地禁锢在怀里，再也不放手。\n事实上，也确实正有人在这么做。\n但见一阵清风吹起，吹起了满地落叶红枫，漫天飞舞不停，遮住了人的视线，一时间什么都看不清。\n片刻，待那风停，落叶重归于地的时候，白衣女子已被人抱在了怀中。那是一个青年男子。男子容貌俊美无俦，身姿健硕挺拔，气质贵雅不凡，眉目间流转间在看向怀中女子的时候，溢满了似水柔情。\n看着这个男子，绝色女子那犹如凝脂般的脸庞上氤氲而起一抹淡粉晕红。她轻启朱唇，美目中蕴含点点娇羞，欲说还休地看着男子，似是想说什么，却终是没有说出口……\n见她这般，俊美男子的眸底划过一道温柔却炽热的光芒，他左手揽着女子的腰身，右手轻柔地抚上了女子的朱唇。轻轻地摩擦着，他说道：“你可知我等这一天等了多久……我本以为你我之间会永无交际，我早已经打算用我自己的方式来守护你。直到你我死去。”话锋一转，俊美男子的语气变得有些低沉：“可是，天怜你我。到头来我终是掌握住了我的命运，推翻了命运。从此以后，再无人能左右我，也无人能伤得了你。你……可开心？”\n青年男子说这句话的时候，有些小心翼翼地样子。却也是心中在乎，所以不能做到像对外人那般的无所顾忌，狠厉无情。\n爱，深深地爱，所以，才会将对方的喜怒哀乐放在心头。\n俊美男子的话让绝色女子那双如琉璃般美丽的眼眸中染起了一抹特别复杂的色彩。似爱恋，似挣扎，似惶恐，似……最后，她睫毛轻颤，眯上了眼睛。但是，她那朱红唇瓣轻启，却颤颤地吐出了几个字：“漠儿……不值……为了我……不值……不值……”说着，两行晶莹清泪从她的眼角滚落，一滴滴落在了俊美男子的衣袖上……。\n惹得俊美男子那双深邃如海的眼眸越发幽暗，他动作极其轻柔地将唇贴上了女子的眼角，允掉了她眼角的泪珠。他的这个动作让绝色女子猛然睁开了双眼。她的双眼中闪烁着一种名为震惊的色彩……她语气轻颤的叫道：“韩漠…你…！”也不难怪她会这般，因为过去的时间里，她和他一直都是以礼相处。从未逾越底线。\n也正是她这一声惊呼，将俊美男子的身份托然而出，此男子正是韩漠。而这白衣女子，宛然就是已然‘死’去了一年之久的苏玉碧，被韩府人称‘碧姨娘’！！\n过往如烟，暂且不提。\n碧姨娘这副震惊如斯的表情让韩漠环抱她腰身的手臂紧了紧。只见韩漠深深地凝视着她，缓而不慢的说道：“值与不值，并不是由别人说了算，也不是你说了就能算。我只知我心中有你，认定了你，这就足矣！至于其他的，不在我的考虑范围内。”\n“一年，现在已经整整一年。我已经没有办法再去等待一年。给我一个结果。这样的生活你开不开心，想不想要。要不要一直这样下去！若是你不要，那么，我绝不会再出现你的面前。我会转身离去！若是想要，那么，我韩漠就此起誓，绝不负你！在世人舆论下，我不能给予你光明正大的身份，可我！！却会给予你唯一！一生的唯一！”\n“现在，在最短的时间里把你的答案告诉我。不要去担心别的，问问你自己的心，你想要什么。”\n要什么？碧姨娘一时慌乱无章，不知该怎么说。不知怎么说，正是因为灵魂深处早已根深蒂固地种下了一些东西。没有办法冲破，没有勇气去打碎。纵是心底很想回答‘要’，却没勇气诉说出来。\n久久……亦或者只是片刻。在碧姨娘天人交战的时候，韩漠突然松开了环抱着她腰身的手臂。背对她，韩漠语气‘忧伤’的说道：“我懂了……你不必为难。从今以后我不会再出现在这里。我会如你所愿，让你安静地生活下去……保重……”\n嘴上这么说，韩漠却在心中暗道：如果你没有勇气来打破它，那么，就让我来打破吧。只要能跟你在一起，我并不介意说一回谎话，做一次戏。\n这么想着，韩漠转身就要‘离去’。却被一双柔荑紧紧抱住，属于碧姨娘那娇柔动听的声音从他背后传来。\n“漠儿……不要……不要走……我……我……我……我……”断断续续半天，碧姨娘也没说出接下来的话。\n韩漠却已经得到想要的东西。他唇角微微上翘，说了一句：“无悔？”\n一瞬间，碧姨娘仿佛看透了一些什么，她柔柔地说道：“不悔……”说完，她的脸颊在韩漠的后背蹭了蹭。\n感受到触及后背的那两个温暖的柔软，一股火气从韩漠体内升起。苦苦压抑了许久的火焰就这么激烈迸发，他忽然转身把她紧紧地抱住，狠狠地吻上了她的唇。直至将她吻得气喘吁吁，双颊红晕，美目中情慾水雾骤起，他方才松开她的唇。紧接，他把她拦腰抱起，飞身进了屋子……\n片刻……屋内欢泣呻吟起，夹杂着男子的粗喘呼吸……一切组合成了一曲扉靡无比的乐曲……却不觉淫靡，反令人心生温馨……\n……小小三粉著\n\n\n关于三根金手指\n    三根金手指的设定，带有一定的玄幻色彩，当初也有不少人就此议论，褒贬不一，但是我最终还是用上了。\n一指自救，一指杀敌，最后一指并没有用上，但是我相信韩漠终究会用上，全书完本的时候，他的生命才走到了一小半，在他往后的生涯中，必然不会是一帆风顺，也必然还会遇到许多的难题，而保留的一根金手指追随他，也就等于是一个希望在追随他。\n所以我愿意将第三根金手指成为希望的手指。\n并非是故作深沉，也不是自以为很有哲理，但是沙漠确实想说，你我同是生活在这个时代，或许会遇到许多的挫折困难，甚至会遇到太多的不平，但是我们心中都该保有希望，而希望的保留，是让我们在人生道路上继续前进的神秘动力。\n一直以来，我对自己的未来生活充满着希望和自信，有了希望的信念，才会让自己的每一步走的很轻松很大气。\n\n\n关于十方名将\n    十方名将是本书设定的一个重要因素，也可说为全书增色不少。\n不少朋友深有怨念，觉得全书完本了，却还没有将十方名将完全摆出来，但是沙漠想笑问一声，真的需要摆出来吗？\n甚至有人觉得这也是烂尾因素之一。\n或许不少人觉得故事戛然而止，会有一种猝然感，由此而产生烂尾之感，这个我都能理解，但是如果说十方名将没有清晰摆出来就算是烂尾，那我实在不敢苟同。\n在朝五大名将，我们都已经十分清楚，而在野名将，本就是一种神秘感。\n我想说明的，无非是这天底下这样一群才干之士，他们的人生价值取向不同，有的固然愿意成为国家的骨干，建功立业，定国安邦，但是却有一类人却有着自己的价值观，愿意泯然众人，过着自己想要的生活。\n在朝的名将固然值得尊敬，但是在野的名将依然值得钦佩。\n在野的名将，以他们的能力，想要求得荣华富贵，当然是易如反掌，但是他们却舍却荣华富贵，只为自己的理念和价值去活，这当然是一种十分正确的人生价值观。\n浮躁的社会，以金钱至上的社会变的喧嚣无比，那么是否所有的人都该在金钱权势之中翻滚？是否还能有人坚守着自己的某一种理想，以自己的生活方式去生活？\n虽然如今很难看到这种人，但是不可否认，在我们中国五千年的文明进程中，这类人曾经拥有许多，而他们的故事和处世哲理，后辈还是愿意回忆一下。\n所以这些人代表的只是一种隐士，他们不被框架束缚，代表的是一个稀少的群体。\n在野的名将，书中自然已经展现了不少，但是究竟谁才是真正的在野五大名将，我相信每个人都有自己的理解。\n\n\n关于写作\n    2009年的一个偶然机会，一个无聊的在业青年感觉生活乏味，又仗着自以为能书三分墨的本事，也自以为是地到了某点开始写书，当时满腔志气，觉得某人一出谁与争锋，在某点发文三万多字，成绩惨淡，正要罢笔远离此行，却不曾想天降贵人。\n纵横当时处于发展时期，编辑“落焰”姐姐找上了这个即将放弃写作的小瘪三，诚意邀请来纵横发展，虽然开出的是白菜价，但是这位小瘪三自觉地有伯乐降临，激动无比，愿追随“落焰”主公，作为马前卒，荡平四海，一统天下。\n    于是乎，某人第一部处女作《江山》开始在纵横连载，天马行空，完全没有网文经验的他在真正写书之后，才知道这行绝非想象的那般简单。\n从那时候起，此人日夜苦读，白天上班，晚上写字，由此拉开了屌丝的人生道路。\n其间，此人性格顽劣，屡次招惹事端，甚至没来由地被一些别有居心者诬陷坑害，遂明白世事不简单，在主公的教诲下，那张向来没有把门的大嘴开始安静，当初的少年心性也开始在主公的耐心教诲下，开始变得成熟起来，不招惹是非，只知道埋头长进自己，好好写书。\n

   三根金手指的设定，带有一定的玄幻色彩，当初也有不少人就此议论，褒贬不一，但是我最终还是用上了。\n一指自救，一指杀敌，最后一指并没有用上，但是我相信韩漠终究会用上，全书完本的时候，他的生命才走到了一小半，在他往后的生涯中，必然不会是一帆风顺，也必然还会遇到许多的难题，而保留的一根金手指追随他，也就等于是一个希望在追随他。\n所以我愿意将第三根金手指成为希望的手指。\n并非是故作深沉，也不是自以为很有哲理，但是沙漠确实想说，你我同是生活在这个时代，或许会遇到许多的挫折困难，甚至会遇到太多的不平，但是我们心中都该保有希望，而希望的保留，是让我们在人生道路上继续前进的神秘动力。\n一直以来，我对自己的未来生活充满着希望和自信，有了希望的信念，才会让自己的每一步走的很轻松很大气。\n\n\n关于十方名将\n    十方名将是本书设定的一个重要因素，也可说为全书增色不少。\n不少朋友深有怨念，觉得全书完本了，却还没有将十方名将完全摆出来，但是沙漠想笑问一声，真的需要摆出来吗？\n甚至有人觉得这也是烂尾因素之一。\n或许不少人觉得故事戛然而止，会有一种猝然感，由此而产生烂尾之感，这个我都能理解，但是如果说十方名将没有清晰摆出来就算是烂尾，那我实在不敢苟同。\n在朝五大名将，我们都已经十分清楚，而在野名将，本就是一种神秘感。\n我想说明的，无非是这天底下这样一群才干之士，他们的人生价值取向不同，有的固然愿意成为国家的骨干，建功立业，定国安邦，但是却有一类人却有着自己的价值观，愿意泯然众人，过着自己想要的生活。\n在朝的名将固然值得尊敬，但是在野的名将依然值得钦佩。\n在野的名将，以他们的能力，想要求得荣华富贵，当然是易如反掌，但是他们却舍却荣华富贵，只为自己的理念和价值去活，这当然是一种十分正确的人生价值观。\n浮躁的社会，以金钱至上的社会变的喧嚣无比，那么是否所有的人都该在金钱权势之中翻滚？是否还能有人坚守着自己的某一种理想，以自己的生活方式去生活？\n虽然如今很难看到这种人，但是不可否认，在我们中国五千年的文明进程中，这类人曾经拥有许多，而他们的故事和处世哲理，后辈还是愿意回忆一下。\n所以这些人代表的只是一种隐士，他们不被框架束缚，代表的是一个稀少的群体。\n在野的名将，书中自然已经展现了不少，但是究竟谁才是真正的在野五大名将，我相信每个人都有自己的理解。\n\n\n关于写作\n    2009年的一个偶然机会，一个无聊的在业青年感觉生活乏味，又仗着自以为能书三分墨的本事，也自以为是地到了某点开始写书，当时满腔志气，觉得某人一出谁与争锋，在某点发文三万多字，成绩惨淡，正要罢笔远离此行，却不曾想天降贵人。\n纵横当时处于发展时期，编辑“落焰”姐姐找上了这个即将放弃写作的小瘪三，诚意邀请来纵横发展，虽然开出的是白菜价，但是这位小瘪三自觉地有伯乐降临，激动无比，愿追随“落焰”主公，作为马前卒，荡平四海，一统天下。\n    于是乎，某人第一部处女作《江山》开始在纵横连载，天马行空，完全没有网文经验的他在真正写书之后，才知道这行绝非想象的那般简单。\n从那时候起，此人日夜苦读，白天上班，晚上写字，由此拉开了屌丝的人生道路。\n其间，此人性格顽劣，屡次招惹事端，甚至没来由地被一些别有居心者诬陷坑害，遂明白世事不简单，在主公的教诲下，那张向来没有把门的大嘴开始安静，当初的少年心性也开始在主公的耐心教诲下，开始变得成熟起来，不招惹是非，只知道埋头长进自己，好好写书。\n    《江山》写完，一百八十万字落幕，此人获益良多，终于明白自己的诸多缺陷，但是从中也开始学会了如何构制框架，如何将一本书形成一个整体。\n节选正文：\n众人本来还以为韩漠只是随口说说，但是此刻听他意思，竟似乎是真的要回东海。\n碧姨娘放下手中缝制的衣裳，看着韩漠道：“漠儿，你真的准备要回东海？”\n韩漠点点头，淡淡一笑。\n“只是你如今走得开吗？”碧姨娘担心道：“若是朝廷传下旨意，让你再回前线，你从东海再回来可赶得及？”\n碧姨娘自然知道韩漠是前线西北军的统帅，此番回京，她却不知内幕，只以为是朝廷有急事召回韩漠，回头还是要重返前线的。\n若是事情完毕，朝廷下令让韩漠重返前线，而韩漠却身处东海，那总是有些不好的。\n韩漠摇摇头，背负双手，望着不远处的水池子，沉吟片刻，终于道：“二伯在前线领军，短时间内，朝廷恐怕是用不上我的。”他并没有深说，只是缓缓走到碧姨娘旁边，拿起碧姨娘缝制的衣裳，上面绣着一只金鲤，栩栩如生，微笑道：“姨娘的手艺如今是越来越好了，这样的手艺只埋没在府中，实在是可惜的很！”\n碧姨娘何等聪慧妇人，听出韩漠话中另有其他意思，但是一时间也不明白其中深意，只是温柔一笑，道：“这又是什么好手艺，比我手艺好的多的是，也说不上埋没。女人家的，不能拿刀拿枪，只能拿着针线……这不正好用上为小定儿做几件衣裳吗？回头我给你们每人再做几套衣裳，上面都绣着你们喜欢的图案，要不嫌弃，出门穿那衣裳，不也照样可以让人瞧见吗？”\n筱倩嘻嘻笑道：“姨娘，依我看啊，回头让相公拿些银子出来，办一家绣坊，凭借姨娘的手艺，那一定是生意红火。咱们回头也过去一起帮忙！”\n"}

\n如果\n你余下的生命，只有几个小时，你会做什么？\n是安静的等待，度过最后的时光，还是放手一搏，为生存而耗尽最后一丝力气？\n行走在阴影之中，暗黑是最好的掩护，邪恶的符文印刻在眼中，用手中的匕首，刺破死亡的浓雾！\n\n\n恶魔篇章、阴影中的行者\n林飞开始了他的恶魔篇章之旅，面对可怕的恶魔，他会生存下去吗？\n\n\n序章·血夜！\n窗外，雷雨交加。\n坐在真皮沙发上的王新德手中捧着一杯价格不菲的红酒，在他身后站着两个穿着露骨的妙龄女郎，这两个女郎此刻正用她们柔若无骨的手指，揉捏着王新德肩膀上的肥肉。\n王新德所在的这间别墅建在郊外的一座半山腰，环境优雅，空气清新。别墅前面的院子里植有草坪，后面则有一个十分巨大的私人游泳池，无论是谁住到这里，都会感觉到非常怯意。奢华和享受，是这里永远的主题。只不过王新德不是来度假享受的。\n女性的柔美和体香可以让任何一个男人融化，但是此刻，王新德却无暇享受这些，甚至酒杯里的顶级红酒，喝到喉咙里，也是索然无味。\n因为他是来避难的，此刻屋子里除了两个他花大钱弄来解闷的妙龄女郎之外，还有几个身穿黑衣的保镖。\n这些保镖都是退伍军人，身手了得。\n而外面的房间里，同样有十几个他高薪聘请的保镖，此外，在别墅的各个通道和门口，也有人守着。而别墅前门和后门，各停着两辆警车，超过十个荷枪实弹的警察，二十四小时监控着这里，当然，目的也是为了保护他。\n之所以如此劳师动众，一来是因为王新德的身份特殊，更重要的是，在几天前，他曾遭遇过一次暗杀。\n那天他运气很好，一个保镖替他挡了一刀。\n一柄不过七八寸的小刀，刺穿了那个保镖的喉咙，温热的血溅在他的皮肤上，随后逐渐冷却，这种感觉让王新德吓的差一点尿了裤子。如果不是当时其他保镖拼死保护，王新德怕是已经见了上帝。\n作为一个大企业的老总和当地政府的政协委员之一，王新德自然有足够的金钱和权力让保镖和警察来保护自己，但即便如此，他现在依旧感觉不到安全。\n他怕了！\n没有人不怕死，尤其是像王新德这样名利双收的大人物。而若是明知道有人日夜想着干掉自己，怕换做是谁，也没法能睡得安稳。\n所以王新德动用他的权势，不但雇了比平时更多的保镖，更要求警方追查那个杀手的资料。而警方展现了他们良好的侦查能力，就在十几分钟前，杀手的资料已经摆到了王新德的面前。\n“林飞，男，二十一岁，孤儿，自幼受商人李学成的资助，小学和中学成绩优秀，高中毕业后考入M国商学院，一年前以优异的成绩毕业，拥有包括心理学在内的三个硕士学位，随后在M国工作，因商人李学成意外死亡，林飞辞去了M国的工作，返回国内吊丧，之后不知什么原因，在三个月前突然失踪。而在几天前，根据刺杀现场疑犯所留下的指纹和监控器拍下的一些相貌特征进行对比分析，可以确定犯案者，就是这个林飞，现在，我们已经对他发出了通缉令，相信很快就可以将他绳之以法！”\n一名带着金丝眼镜的警官将手中的资料念给王新德听，后者听到李学成这个名字后，眉毛不动声色的动了动，靠在了柔软的真皮沙发上，脸上露出了原来如此的神情。\n那个一直困扰王新德的问题，终于得到了解答，那就是为什么他会惹到这个杀手。原因，都出在李学成的身上。\n李学成，一个本分的商人，因为一些生意上的冲突而得罪了王新德，于是便被王新德雇人杀死，并且成功的伪装成一场车祸意外。之后，王新德更是丧心病狂的绑架了李学成的妻子，并且残忍的奸杀了对方。\n而作为被李学成资助过的孤儿，为恩人报仇，也是理所应当的了。只是陷害李学成这件事做的本该是神不知鬼不觉，那个林飞又是怎么知道的？\n“我要你们不惜一切代价，将这个林飞抓到，必要的时候，可以……”王新德还没有说完，这个时候，就听到不知从哪儿传来的咔嚓一声，整个别墅的灯光，突然熄灭了。\n“怎么回事？”眼前陷入一片黑暗，王新德马上就晃了，他此刻本就是如同惊弓之鸟，此刻自然是吓了一跳。\n房间里一阵鸡飞狗跳，黑暗中，王新德只感觉脖子上突然被抵上了一个东西。\n那东西冰冷异常，根据皮肤上传来的那种锋利的触感，王新德脑中浮现出一样东西来。\n刀，自己脖子上，竟然架着一把锋利至极的刀。\n这让王新德马上感觉到膀胱有些发胀，想要叫喊，但却是叫不出声来。\n“想叫？你可以试试，我保证，伴随着你的叫声喷出的，是你动脉里的鲜血！”一个冰冷的声音从王新德耳边响起。\n这让王新德惊恐到了极点，他听出来了，这个声音非常的耳熟，因为就在十几秒之前，他还听过。\n是那个戴眼镜的警官。\n此刻，王新德因为恐惧，除了点头，已经丧失了思考能力，他实在想不通，那个警官为什么要这样做。\n而那个警官，显然感受到了王新德的恐惧，却是平淡异常：“你害怕了？原来，你也会怕，那么当初你设计害死富商李学成，绑架奸杀他妻子的时候，可曾害怕过？有没有想过今天，会有人替他们讨回公道？”\n这个时候王新德点头也不是，摇头也不是，他只希望房间里那些吃干饭的保镖能早一点反应过来。\n“你不要再幻想了，我在假扮警察进入这个别墅里的时候，已经在电闸上做了手脚，他们要恢复，至少需要一分钟时间，而一分钟，足够让你安心上路了，哦对了，到了那边别忘了给李叔叔和阿姨他们磕头认错！”\n听到这句话，王新德猛然一愣，马上他就知道这个警官是什么人了。\n这个人就是林飞！\n他刚想豁出去大喊，却是猛然感觉整个脖子一阵剧痛，王新德的喉咙包括动脉都被一下切开，除了发出“咕噜咕噜”的声响外，他什么都做不了。\n生命，就是如此脆弱，只要一刀，便可以被剥夺而去。\n十几秒后，一个保镖将被破坏的电闸箱修好，灯再一次亮了起来。房间里的人刚刚松了口气，却是看到极其恐怖的一幕。\n王新德此刻瘫坐在他的真皮沙发上，浑身鲜血，半边脖子被划开，已然是死透了。\n“怎么可能？那杀手是怎么闯进来的？”此刻，带着眼镜的年轻警官一身是血，对四周的保镖咆哮着，表现出了正常的惊讶反应。\n屋子里的保镖都是大眼瞪小眼，他们刚刚什么都看不到，而他们的老板，就是在短短不到一分钟的时间里，悄无声息的被人切开了脖子。\n王新德死了，现场陷入了一片混乱，大量的警察进入了房间，而原本那个带着眼睛的年轻警官却是平淡地走出了房间。\n外门的雨，小了很多。\n年轻警察手里还拿着刚刚那份档案，档案里的人，就是他本人。\n“想不到，这些警察这么快就找到了我的资料，不过，他们还是晚了，呵呵，罪恶的人，一定会受到惩罚，谁都无法阻止！”\n屋子外，林飞，也就是这个年轻警察将眼镜丢在了路旁，同时将手里那份档案撕碎，丢在了一个角落。\n外面的警察通过对讲机和电话，将王新德死亡的消息递出去，过不了多久，这里将会出现数百名警察，林飞知道，在那之前，自己最好离开。\n而就在这个时候，林飞却是看到外面涌进来一群警察。其中一个浑身被扒光的人正一边解着手上的绳索，一边指着自己大声叫喊。\n一瞬间，林飞知道，自己暴露了。\n他还是太心软了，对于局外人，他不想下杀手。当时为了装扮警察，所以只是将那个身材和自己相似的警察打晕绑好，脱去了对方的衣服，然后丢在了路旁的草丛，现在，林飞却是知道，自己要品尝“仁慈”带来的苦果。\n这个时候，对面有不少警察已经举起了手枪。\n林飞知道，自己绝对不能被捕，所以猛的向一旁的草丛翻滚，同时枪声响起。\n许多子弹擦着林飞飞过，但还是有一颗，狠狠的钻入了林飞的腰部。剧痛让林飞闷哼了一声，但他还是忍着痛，向路旁的小山坡跳了下去。\n十几分钟后，林飞暂时摆脱了警察的追捕，但也因为失血过多，而没有了任何力气。\n寒冷，疲倦一瞬间都涌了上来，中枪的部位，已经彻底的麻木，感觉不到丝毫疼痛。林飞绕过一个墙角，不得不蹲坐下来。\n林飞都不用看伤口，便知道自己不行了。\n但，他还不能死在这里，因为，李学成还有一个十七岁的女儿，在整理李学成遗物的时候，林飞曾经找出过一个信封，里面写着，若是李学成夫妇发生了什么不测，便拜托林飞代为照顾他们的女儿。\n恩人将唯一的女儿托付给自己，这便是林飞不能死的理由。此外王新德还有一个弟弟，掌管着当地的黑帮，若是知道他哥哥是因为李学成而死，一定不会放过李学成唯一的女儿。\n所以，林飞绝对不能死，至少，不能现在就死。\n只是，生命依然在流逝。\n渐渐的，林飞感觉到身体完全失去了控制，身体旁边，血已经流出了一大片，在巷子外的灯光下，闪耀着一丝耀眼的猩红。\n好几次，林飞都想站起来，但是身体似乎早已经不属于他，林飞的眼皮越来越重，倦意仿佛潮水一般席卷而来。\n已经处于弥留之际的林飞闭上了眼睛，只是就在这个时候，他突然听到了一个声音。\n这个声音仿佛来自很远，又仿佛，就是来自耳边。\n“你很不甘吗？奉献出你的灵魂，我便让你活下去！”\n节选正文：\n在场的恶魔领主，除了那些被自己收服的，其他的里面也是三五成团，有的实力不弱，更有很大一部分，都是凝结了领域的恶魔。\n其中，林飞甚至看到了曾经和自己交手过的恐惧魔领主，只是后者在看到自己后，眼瞳里露出了畏惧的神色，明显，林飞之前那9999战力的顶级形态，让它彻底产生了恐惧。\n除此之外，还有曾经间接给林飞带路的山羊领主和半蛇领主，它们看到林飞，都是一脸错愕，本来那个山羊领主还想说什么，而半蛇领主却是赶忙将对方拉到了一边。\n“你干什么？”山羊领主明显有些不满。\n“我干什么？我这是在救你，你这个白痴，你没有看到浮游魔领主和女魔领主也站在那个家伙身后吗？显然，连这些可怕的领主都成了那个家伙的手下，你如果敢去挑衅，我敢打赌，他一定会杀了你！”\n半蛇领主明显相当的聪明，更是懂得审时度势，虽然它也不知道发生了什么事，但是对面那个家伙身后的确是跟着很多在他们看来都不敢招惹的恶魔领主，对方能做到这一点，足以说明拥有极强的实力，所以这种人是少惹为妙。\n山羊领主也是恍然大悟，看着林飞身后那一大群恶魔领主，却是露出了一脸不敢置信的神色。\n的确，就如同半蛇领主所说的，那些强大的恶魔领主竟然隐隐之间都在以对方为中心的方式站着，虽然不知道那个家伙是怎么做到的，但显然，那已经不是自己这种领主所能招惹的了。\n随着时间的推移，又有一些领主赶到，所有的恶魔都在等待着议会大厅开启，它们想要的，也只是大厅里的一个位置，因为只有那样，才能获得地位，甚至是争夺最后和地狱晶石接触的宝贵机会。\n几分钟后，那个庞大建筑的大门终于是慢慢的打开，一下子，所有的恶魔领主都屏气凝神，等待大门完全开启。\n\n\n[要求]

天才+灵药，周益乐必然会创造一个传奇。\n\n\n序\n摆放在床头的通讯器，突然亮了起来，刺耳的铃音，一下两下三下，不知疲倦的鸣叫着，把美梦中间的周益乐吵醒，脸上带着睡眠不足的苍白，拿起通讯器时，嘴里嘟嘟囔囔的碎骂了一句，让不让人睡觉了。\n可当周益乐看到通讯器号码的时候，却脸色一变，叹了一口气，不敢怠慢的接通了。窗外是昏暗的天空，23世纪的天总是雾茫茫的，少有阳光明媚的日子，周益乐腹议了一下天气，把最后一口营养液给喝完，就匆匆地上线，现实和虚幻之间，他出现在一个别致的竹屋里面。\n竹屋不大，也就是四五十平方的样子，位于屋子的中央，一个巨大的丹鼎，占去了大半的空间，丹鼎之外，却如菜市场一般，围满了人。\n没等周益乐适应现实和虚幻，一个抱着一大包的东西的魁梧汉子，毫不费力的分开了人群，来到他的面前，高声吩咐道：“流浪丹师，这是今天的丹药，在明天中午12点之前，最少要合成30枚坤元丹，少爷说了，他要赶在仙魔演义之前，渡过天劫，信用点已经打到了你的卡上了，记住，要快。”\n“可是……”\n周益乐张嘴正要说话，可汉子不给他说话的机会，不由分说地把材料塞到了他怀中，扬长而去，看着汉子一转身离开了他的丹房，周益乐张张嘴，什么都没说出来，看着手中的东西，100多个普通的玉瓶，上面写着玉灵丹，干乾丹，养元丹等二到三等丹药的名称。\n流浪丹师是周益乐游戏中的名字，这款游戏是三年前由神龙公司开发出来的，大型仙侠类游戏魔仙录，周益乐是这个游戏中间的一个玩家，不过却没有这个命来享受游戏，游戏是他谋生的手段，算得上是个职业玩家吧。\n周益乐同普通的职业玩家稍微的有些不同，战斗意识差的是一塌糊涂的，不能依靠打装备，代练等级挣钱，好在魔仙录是超大型的游戏，除了以上的方式之外，还是可以选择其他的方式挣钱。\n周益乐进入游戏之后，定位比较的现实，选择了生活玩家这个职业，依靠大量的时间，借助着合成丹药和炼制丹药，从一些玩游戏的有钱少爷那里挣到一些信用点，勉强的维持着生计。\n看了看手中的玉瓶，深深地吸了一口气，看来今天又要累的够呛，30枚坤元丹，最少要花费他15个小时以上的时间，这还是运气好的情况下，如果运气不好，通宵都有可能。\n即便在游戏中，周益乐脸上的苍白仍然没有褪去，昨天为了赶活，只睡了2个小时，疲惫还没有消除，就接到他们的通知，这些有钱的少爷们，真的以为自己是铁打的么。\n周益乐心中嘀咕着，借助这个发泄心中的不满，却不敢拒绝这单生意，甚至不敢叫出声来，先不说这个少爷的权势，这位名叫陈宇的公子，分分钟捏死他这样的小人物，这单生意的利润也是不菲的，一天忙碌下来，可以挣到他一个星期的生活费，包原料，一枚坤元丹30信用点，抵得上高级丹药的价格了，坤元丹合成起来麻烦了点，它还是属于四级丹药，最多比较珍贵一点。\n周益乐轻轻地摇摇头，想当年，年轻的时候，连续熬上五六个通宵，都完全没问题，现在不过是两三个通宵，就有些吃不消了，是不是老了。\n拍了拍脑袋，想着么多干什么，还是赶快把坤元丹给炼好，大不了做完了这一单生意，好好的休息几天好了，借着这一次魔仙演义资料片的发布，也小挣了一笔，休息几天散散心也好，一直期待的植物园烧烤，虚拟世界中尝试了那么多次，也该实地的尝试一下了。\n坤元丹是四级丹药，合成起来却非常复杂，必须把三十六种初级丹药，按照一定的比例混合，使用合成技能，一个一个的合成，其过程必须高度专注，不能出错，是一个花费时间的水磨工夫，一般没有经验的炼丹师，往往合成不下来。可坤元丹却是修真者渡过天劫的必备药品，可以提高15%的渡劫成功率，庞大的市场和相对较小的产出，价格一直居高不下。\n当年为了学习合成坤元丹的技术，周益乐吃了不少的苦，除了游戏中间花费的精力之外，当时练习的时候，整整一个月依靠着泡面度日，很是凄惨。\n事实证明，他学习这种复杂的合成丹药技术的决定是正确的，从那一天开始，他从一个在贫困线上挣扎职业玩家，渐渐的变得有了保障，甚至有精力和金钱去学习更高级的炼丹技术，在巨鼎城附近的丹师中间，称得上是小有名气了，不必依靠大量低级丹药，去和一大堆的丹师竞争，争取微薄的信用点了，反而过起了悠闲的生活。\n不过这一次的资料片却是例外，为了在资料片中占得先机，几乎所有的有钱人都行动起来了，周益乐也接了大量的活，甚至无法保证充足的休息。\n赶快干完这一单，明天就升级服务器了，到时候好好的休息吧，把心中的不快给驱除，周益乐进入了状态，这也是他能够在巨鼎城立足的根本原因，总能很快的进入状态，把丹药分门别类的放好，各种类别的丹药都齐备，成色上面也不错，足够合成150枚坤元丹，陈少虽然强势，可是倒也厚道，损耗也计算到里面了，合成坤元丹的成功率一般在30%左右，周益乐多一点，也不过是达到35%，5%的提高，在高级丹药上面，着实是很大一笔。\n不过坤元丹是个例外，坤元丹最大的利润就在于合成的难度，这些初级丹药上面，赚不到什么钱的，这或许是对方多给的原因吧。\n召唤出技能的菜单，流浪丹师这个游戏角色，在基本素质上面，火属性天赋和感知都是满的，火属性天赋代表着对于火属性的术法有先天的优势，感知对炼丹有奇效，双满的角色，恐怕是1000万个号码中间，都未必出现一个，比率非常的低，即便出现了搭配如此之好的，也少见。\n别人随到了这样的角色的时候，都会欣喜异常，主修火法，辅修炼丹，相辅相成之下，成为一代宗师也不在话下。可是出现在周益乐的身上，他只能是一笑置之，感知还有些作用，帮助他在炼丹的时候多一分的成功率，火属性天赋就浪费掉了，他没有钱，也没有精力让这个属性发扬光大，虽然依靠火属性天赋，修炼了仙品以上的功法，可以提高炼丹的水平，甚至可以炼制仙丹以上的丹药，可惜那只是一种奢望，即便最低级的仙品功法所需要的信用点数，足够在现实中起一栋大楼了。\n魔仙录运营三年多以来，在开始的时候周益乐还有幻想，想象着依靠天赋成名立万，做了生活职业者了之后，看了大量的有钱人，借助着金钱的魔力，迅速和普通人拉开差距之后，他就知道，天赋并不代表一切，没有雄厚的实力做后盾，还是老老实实的做生活职业者好了，最起码能够糊口不是么。\n别的不说，只看那些少爷们，挥洒千金，硬生生的把一个感知和属性天赋低等的人物，用易髓丹砸到顶级，他就彻底的熄了心中的渴望，游戏，特别是魔仙录影响力这么大的游戏，本身就是有钱人的乐园，穷人，还是做绿叶好了。\n站在丹鼎的面前，周益乐施展合成术，把各种初级的丹药按照顺序，分别的放入到丹鼎中间，合成术柔和的绿光闪动着，放进去的丹药都被吸收进去，形成一股特殊的药力，周益乐一边放入丹药，一边感知着里面药力的平衡，精神保持着高度的集中。\n大概15分钟之后，超过200枚的丹药放入进去，代表着合成术的绿光由淡绿变成了深绿，坤元丹的合成到了最关键的时刻，借助着强大的感知和对坤元丹的合成的熟悉，让周益乐熟练地控制着丹鼎，当最后，明亮的绿色光辉笼罩了整个丹室的时候，坤元丹合成完成了，一个金黄色，散发着无穷的光辉的丹药，在丹鼎中间形成。\n无论是外观，还是颜色，都证明这个坤元丹应该属于是上品丹药，周益乐赶紧的找出来一个玉瓶，把它给装起来，这么贵重的丹药，裸露在空气中，很容易降品的，今天不错，取得了开门红。\n接下来，成功和失败并存，从早晨8点开始，周益乐都在高强度的合成中间，保持了精神的高度集中，今天的合成术很给面子，成功率不低，到了晚上的9点钟左右，他居然提前完成了30枚坤元丹的炼制，剩余的材料大概有75份左右，也就是说成功率接近4成。\n揉揉因高度集中而发酸的眼睛，周益乐把30个装着坤元丹的玉瓶给集中，打包捆绑之后，给陈宇邮寄了过去，这个小少爷，不能够得罪啊，在A市拥有庞大的势力，还是尽早的邮寄过去吧，万一明天起晚了，耽误了他的事情，他的手段，可是会让人刻骨铭心记着的。\n看着邮寄完成的提示过来，周益乐才放松下来，首先眼睛发酸，眼皮都要沉下来了，昨天只睡了2小时，之前的几天，睡眠时间也没有超过3小时的，高强度的合成不但消耗游戏中的精力值，也消耗现实中的精力，合成中间的搭配的方法，任何一个出错，都会对合成产生影响。\n不能睡，要睡还是等到下线之后，躺在床上睡，周益乐这样想的，可是意识和身体似乎出现了断层，意识距离他越来越远，越来越远，借着他的眼前一黑，彻底的陷入到了无限的虚无中间。\n就这样，合成了一天的丹药的周益乐，就这样——‘睡’着了。\n节选正文：许文昌说道。\n“又闭关了？”\n周益乐感慨一下，似乎天虚子是经常的闭关，动辄就是几个月几年，不过按照典籍上面所述，到了他们的这个层次，这还真的不算什么闭关，对于元婴期悠长的岁月来说，三五十年的闭关都非常的正常，特别在突破境界的时候，不过天虚子显然在修炼一道上，已经达到了极限了，他在元婴前期停留的时间超过500年了，已经没有什么希望突破了。\n见到周益乐突破了练气期的12层，许文昌也非常的为他高兴，加之他已经出来了，他的职司也没什么了，索性前往一直居住的山谷，随便的抓捕了几只野兽，在那里大块朵。\n上次回来，周益乐几乎没有和许文昌交流，就闭关了，许文昌一直很好奇他在天星大草原的经历，趁着烧烤的时候，就问出来了，周益乐也一一的诉说，当说到最后，面对三级妖兽水蜥蜴死里逃生的时候，许文昌也不由被周益乐的大胆所倾倒。\n三级妖兽啊，即便是现在的他，在对付的时候也要小心翼翼的，更何况当时只是练气期的周益乐，按照他对于天虚子的了解，天虚子的真正目的也只是让他适应一下天星大草原的蓝圈和绿圈，至于青灵草和霓虹花，只用找一个速度慢的妖兽，调开它采集就好了，谁知道周益乐这么的胆大，直接找到一个开火进攻了，相信即便天虚子师叔祖知道，也会吓一跳的。\n“阿乐，下一次，你不能这么的恣意妄为了，要知道，你现在可是门派的希望。”\n“我当然不会了。”\n周益乐保证到，他对于上一次的死里逃生，也是心有余悸的，如果早知道水蜥蜴那么的难缠，他绝对不会上的。\n周益乐突然想到了，还有大批的炼器材料没有处理呢，问道：“对了，许哥，宗门是怎么炼器的么？”\n“炼器？”\n\n[要求]

Bussard, Journal of\n\tPropulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990\n\n\t    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion\n\t    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the\n\t    thrust-power \"gain\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values\n\t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\n\t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \"high-thrust\"\n\t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\n\t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\n\t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100\n\t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\n\t    \"high-thrust\" flight capability. One performance example shows a\n\t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\n\t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows\n\t    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in\n\t    Earth/moon space.\n\n\t\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for\n\tAerospace Flight Propulsion\" by Robert W.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion\n\tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.\n\n\t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron\n\t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times\n\t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma\n\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\n\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\n\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\n\t    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm\n\t    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure\n\t    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically\n\t    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power\n\t    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens\n\t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the\n\t    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages\n\t    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I\n\t    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob\n\t    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently\n\t    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one\n\t    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather\n\t    than Tokamak.

Bussard, Journal of\n\tPropulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990\n\n\t    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion\n\t    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the\n\t    thrust-power \"gain\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values\n\t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\n\t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \"high-thrust\"\n\t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\n\t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\n\t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100\n\t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\n\t    \"high-thrust\" flight capability. One performance example shows a\n\t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\n\t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows\n\t    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in\n\t    Earth/moon space.\n\n\t\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for\n\tAerospace Flight Propulsion\" by Robert W.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion\n\tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.\n\n\t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron\n\t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times\n\t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma\n\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\n\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\n\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\n\t    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm\n\t    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure\n\t    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically\n\t    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power\n\t    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens\n\t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the\n\t    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages\n\t    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I\n\t    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob\n\t    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently\n\t    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one\n\t    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather\n\t    than Tokamak.

(A ``block\n  cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,\n  say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) The notion of\n  product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern\n  product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84], DES [NBS77], SP-networks\n  [KAM78], LOKI [BRO90], FEAL [SHI84], PES [LAI90], Khufu and Khafre\n  [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product\n  ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,\n  and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER,\n  DES, LOKI, and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers.\n\n  The following table compares the main parameters of several product \n  ciphers:\n\n  cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds\n  LUCIFER          128               128                16\n  DES               64                56                16\n  LOKI              64                64                16\n  FEAL              64               128            2^x, x >= 5\n  PES               64               128                 8\n\n* What makes a product cipher secure?\n\n  Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is\n  completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the\n  cipher ``looks highly random''. For example, the cipher must be\n  nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends\n  on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown\n  that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a\n  dependence. In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing''\n  function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a\n  complex nonlinear fashion.\n\n  The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are\n  referred to as S-boxes. For example, LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes, and DES\n  has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a\n  careful design of these S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria\n  for the S-boxes of DES, which apply to S-boxes in general, may be\n  found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86].\n\n* What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?\n\n  Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks.\n  Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,\n  the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit\n  blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit\n  permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}.\n  The collection of all these permutations P_K, where K ranges over all\n  possible keys, is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from\n  plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate\n  a large subset of S_{2^N}.\n\n  Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple\n  product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a\n  sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the\n  symmetric group: it consists of all ``even'' permutations, i.e., all\n  permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)\n  Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show\n  that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number\n  of rounds.\n\n  The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the\n  group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an\n  extension over single encipherment if for keys K1, K2 there does\n  not exist a third key K3 such that\n\n  E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**)\n\n  which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys\n  K1, K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If\n  for every K1, K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then\n  we say that E is a group.\n\n  This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was\n  extensively studied by Sherman, Kaliski, and Rivest [SHE88]. In their\n  paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a\n  group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93].\n\n* What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?\n\n  Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under\n  some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K\n  appears to be a random element of S_{2^N}, the symmetric group.\n  Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K\n  and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some\n  order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial\n  time. That is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot\n  determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal\n  decision is no better than simply guessing.\n\n  Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers\n  are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by\n  random boolean functions.\n\n* How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?\n\n  There are four standard \"modes of operation\" (and numerous non-standard\n  ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S.\n  Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81,\n  published in 1980.  See the question about \"ECB\" below for more details.\n\n  Although they are defined for the DES block cipher, the \"modes of\n  operation\" can be used with any block cipher.\n\n* Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?\n\n  One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself\n  that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself \n  whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation.  But one\n  cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key, and \n  thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages\n  that were authenticated using that key.\n  \n  See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message\n  authentication using DES.\n\n* What exactly is DES?\n\n  DES is the U.S. Government's Data Encryption Standard - a product \n  cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.  \n\n  It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)].\n  FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS.\n  DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)\n  defined in ANSI X3.92-1981. \n\n* What is triple DES?\n\n  Triple DES is a product cipher which, like DES, operates on 64-bit \n  data blocks.  There are several forms, each of which uses the DES\n  cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.\n  The \"DES modes of operation\" may also be used with triple-DES.\n\n  Some people refer to E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) as triple-DES.\n\n  This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985\n  \"Financial Institution Key Management\" and is intended for use in\n  encrypting DES keys and IVs for \"Automated Key Distribution\".  Its\n  formal name is \"Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key\n  Pair\", but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE.\n\n  That standard says (section 7.2.1): \"Key encrypting keys may be a single\n  DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional\n  security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long\n  security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a\n  single key.\"\n\n  Others use the term \"triple-DES\" for E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) or\n  E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,x))).\n\n  One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form\n  E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance\n  has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on\n  sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key\n  from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on\n  its own part.)\n\n* What is differential cryptanalysis?\n\n  Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be\n  applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on\n  a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by\n  Biham and Shamir [BIH91], but Coppersmith has remarked that the\n  S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.\n  This method has proved effective against several product ciphers,\n  notably FEAL [BI91a].\n\n  Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of\n  ciphertexts Y, Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X, X' satisfy a\n  known difference D = X+X', where + is componentwise XOR. In the\n  basic Biham-Shamir attack, 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required\n  to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required\n  if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In these cases, the actual key\n  can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.\n  For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many\n  known plaintexts.\n\n  The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling\n  observations on the algorithm. Most importantly, if the key\n  schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used,\n  the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus\n  independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES.\n  Further, the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that\n  changing even single entries in these tables yields significant\n  improvement in the differential attack.\n\n  Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I would say\n  that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence\n  of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.''\n\n* How was NSA involved in the design of DES?\n\n  According to Kinnucan [KIN78], Tuchman, a member of the group that\n  developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying, ``We developed the DES\n  algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not\n  dictate a single wire!'' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of\n  DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in\n  Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``Their\n  basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,\n  and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes\n  containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA....\n  `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep\n  secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,' explains Tuchman.''\n  \n  On the other hand, a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in\n  the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States\n  Select Committee on Intelligence'', printed in the IEEE\n  Communications Magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: ``In the development\n  of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient;\n  indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and\n  certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their\n  knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.''\n\n  Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA.\n  The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the\n  algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense\n  resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman\n  presented above.\n\n* Is DES available in software?\n\n  Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for\n  pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY];\n  Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK].\n  A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87].\n\n  FIPS 46-1 says \"The algorithm specified in this standard is to be\n  implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ...\n  Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in\n  compliance with this standard.\"  Despite this, software\n  implementations abound, and are used by government agencies.\n\n* Is DES available in hardware?\n\n  The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors.\n  We don't vouch for the quality or even existence of the products.\n\n  Chip Rosenthal says: ``Dallas Semiconductor makes a DES\n  encryption/decryption device for use on standard, digital 64Kbps PCM\n  telecom data streams. It is capable of processing data in real time,\n  e.g. one sample/frame. It is the DS2160. Their phone number is\n  214-450-0400. You would probably need to talk with Dewight in Telecom\n  marketing.''\n\n  Christian Franke, franke@informatik.rwth-aachen.de, says: ``1.\n  Cryptech CRY12C102: 22.5Mbit/s according to Data Sheet, with 32 Bit\n  interface.

They can be reached at (613) 820-0024.\n\n* Can DES be used to protect classified information?\n\n  DES is not intended to protect classified data.  FIPS 46-1 says:\n  \"This standard will be used by Federal departments and agencies for\n  the cryptographic protection of computer data when the following\n  conditions apply: 1.  ...  cryptographic protection is required; and\n  2. the data is not classified according to the National Security Act\n  of 1947, as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.\"\n\n* What are \"ECB\", \"CBC\", \"CFB\", and \"OFB\" encryption?\n\n  These are methods for using block ciphers, such as DES, to encrypt \n  messages, files, and blocks of data, known as \"modes of operation.\"\n  Four \"modes of operation\" are defined in FIPS 81 (1980 December 2), \n  and also in ANSI X3.106-1983.   \n\n  FIPS 81 specifies that when 7-bit ASCII data is sent in octets, the\n  unused most-significant bit is to be set to 1.\n  FIPS 81 also specifies the padding for short blocks.\n\n  The four DES modes of operation are: \n\tElectronic Code Book  (ECB), \n\tCipher Block Chaining (CBC), \n\tK-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB), and \n\tK-bit Output FeedBack (OFB).\n\n  These methods are explained below in a c-language-like notation.\n\n  Some symbols:\n\n  P[n]\tThe n'th block of plaintext, input to encryption, output from\n  \tdecryption.

(A ``block\n  cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,\n  say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) The notion of\n  product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern\n  product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84], DES [NBS77], SP-networks\n  [KAM78], LOKI [BRO90], FEAL [SHI84], PES [LAI90], Khufu and Khafre\n  [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product\n  ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,\n  and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER,\n  DES, LOKI, and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers.\n\n  The following table compares the main parameters of several product \n  ciphers:\n\n  cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds\n  LUCIFER          128               128                16\n  DES               64                56                16\n  LOKI              64                64                16\n  FEAL              64               128            2^x, x >= 5\n  PES               64               128                 8\n\n* What makes a product cipher secure?\n\n  Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is\n  completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the\n  cipher ``looks highly random''. For example, the cipher must be\n  nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends\n  on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown\n  that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a\n  dependence. In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing''\n  function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a\n  complex nonlinear fashion.\n\n  The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are\n  referred to as S-boxes. For example, LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes, and DES\n  has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a\n  careful design of these S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria\n  for the S-boxes of DES, which apply to S-boxes in general, may be\n  found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86].\n\n* What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?\n\n  Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks.\n  Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,\n  the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit\n  blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit\n  permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}.\n  The collection of all these permutations P_K, where K ranges over all\n  possible keys, is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from\n  plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate\n  a large subset of S_{2^N}.\n\n  Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple\n  product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a\n  sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the\n  symmetric group: it consists of all ``even'' permutations, i.e., all\n  permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)\n  Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show\n  that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number\n  of rounds.\n\n  The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the\n  group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an\n  extension over single encipherment if for keys K1, K2 there does\n  not exist a third key K3 such that\n\n  E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**)\n\n  which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys\n  K1, K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If\n  for every K1, K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then\n  we say that E is a group.\n\n  This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was\n  extensively studied by Sherman, Kaliski, and Rivest [SHE88]. In their\n  paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a\n  group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93].\n\n* What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?\n\n  Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under\n  some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K\n  appears to be a random element of S_{2^N}, the symmetric group.\n  Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K\n  and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some\n  order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial\n  time. That is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot\n  determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal\n  decision is no better than simply guessing.\n\n  Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers\n  are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by\n  random boolean functions.\n\n* How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?\n\n  There are four standard \"modes of operation\" (and numerous non-standard\n  ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S.\n  Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81,\n  published in 1980.  See the question about \"ECB\" below for more details.\n\n  Although they are defined for the DES block cipher, the \"modes of\n  operation\" can be used with any block cipher.\n\n* Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?\n\n  One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself\n  that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself \n  whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation.  But one\n  cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key, and \n  thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages\n  that were authenticated using that key.\n  \n  See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message\n  authentication using DES.\n\n* What exactly is DES?\n\n  DES is the U.S. Government's Data Encryption Standard - a product \n  cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.  \n\n  It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)].\n  FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS.\n  DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)\n  defined in ANSI X3.92-1981. \n\n* What is triple DES?\n\n  Triple DES is a product cipher which, like DES, operates on 64-bit \n  data blocks.  There are several forms, each of which uses the DES\n  cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.\n  The \"DES modes of operation\" may also be used with triple-DES.\n\n  Some people refer to E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) as triple-DES.\n\n  This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985\n  \"Financial Institution Key Management\" and is intended for use in\n  encrypting DES keys and IVs for \"Automated Key Distribution\".  Its\n  formal name is \"Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key\n  Pair\", but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE.\n\n  That standard says (section 7.2.1): \"Key encrypting keys may be a single\n  DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional\n  security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long\n  security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a\n  single key.\"\n\n  Others use the term \"triple-DES\" for E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) or\n  E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,x))).\n\n  One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form\n  E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance\n  has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on\n  sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key\n  from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on\n  its own part.)\n\n* What is differential cryptanalysis?\n\n  Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be\n  applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on\n  a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by\n  Biham and Shamir [BIH91], but Coppersmith has remarked that the\n  S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.\n  This method has proved effective against several product ciphers,\n  notably FEAL [BI91a].\n\n  Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of\n  ciphertexts Y, Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X, X' satisfy a\n  known difference D = X+X', where + is componentwise XOR. In the\n  basic Biham-Shamir attack, 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required\n  to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required\n  if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In these cases, the actual key\n  can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.\n  For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many\n  known plaintexts.\n\n  The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling\n  observations on the algorithm. Most importantly, if the key\n  schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used,\n  the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus\n  independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES.\n  Further, the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that\n  changing even single entries in these tables yields significant\n  improvement in the differential attack.\n\n  Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I would say\n  that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence\n  of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.''\n\n* How was NSA involved in the design of DES?\n\n  According to Kinnucan [KIN78], Tuchman, a member of the group that\n  developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying, ``We developed the DES\n  algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not\n  dictate a single wire!'' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of\n  DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in\n  Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``Their\n  basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,\n  and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes\n  containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA....\n  `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep\n  secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,' explains Tuchman.''\n  \n  On the other hand, a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in\n  the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States\n  Select Committee on Intelligence'', printed in the IEEE\n  Communications Magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: ``In the development\n  of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient;\n  indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and\n  certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their\n  knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.''\n\n  Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA.\n  The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the\n  algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense\n  resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman\n  presented above.\n\n* Is DES available in software?\n\n  Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for\n  pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY];\n  Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK].\n  A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87].\n\n  FIPS 46-1 says \"The algorithm specified in this standard is to be\n  implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ...\n  Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in\n  compliance with this standard.\"  Despite this, software\n  implementations abound, and are used by government agencies.\n\n* Is DES available in hardware?\n\n  The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors.\n  We don't vouch for the quality or even existence of the products.\n\n  Chip Rosenthal says: ``Dallas Semiconductor makes a DES\n  encryption/decryption device for use on standard, digital 64Kbps PCM\n  telecom data streams. It is capable of processing data in real time,\n  e.g. one sample/frame. It is the DS2160. Their phone number is\n  214-450-0400. You would probably need to talk with Dewight in Telecom\n  marketing.''\n\n  Christian Franke, franke@informatik.rwth-aachen.de, says: ``1.\n  Cryptech CRY12C102: 22.5Mbit/s according to Data Sheet, with 32 Bit\n  interface. We use this one, because it was the only one available when\n  we started the project. No problems !  2. Pijnenburg PCC100: 20Mbit/s\n  according to Data Sheet.

They can be reached at (613) 820-0024.\n\n* Can DES be used to protect classified information?\n\n  DES is not intended to protect classified data.  FIPS 46-1 says:\n  \"This standard will be used by Federal departments and agencies for\n  the cryptographic protection of computer data when the following\n  conditions apply: 1.  ...  cryptographic protection is required; and\n  2. the data is not classified according to the National Security Act\n  of 1947, as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.\"\n\n* What are \"ECB\", \"CBC\", \"CFB\", and \"OFB\" encryption?\n\n  These are methods for using block ciphers, such as DES, to encrypt \n  messages, files, and blocks of data, known as \"modes of operation.\"\n  Four \"modes of operation\" are defined in FIPS 81 (1980 December 2), \n  and also in ANSI X3.106-1983.   \n\n  FIPS 81 specifies that when 7-bit ASCII data is sent in octets, the\n  unused most-significant bit is to be set to 1.\n  FIPS 81 also specifies the padding for short blocks.\n\n  The four DES modes of operation are: \n\tElectronic Code Book  (ECB), \n\tCipher Block Chaining (CBC), \n\tK-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB), and \n\tK-bit Output FeedBack (OFB).\n\n  These methods are explained below in a c-language-like notation.\n\n  Some symbols:\n\n  P[n]\tThe n'th block of plaintext, input to encryption, output from\n  \tdecryption.

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you \nin the thousands of communities around the country that are taking \npart in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.\n\t     \n\t     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas \nJefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to \nmention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he \nhas been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all \nfollowed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education \nhere in this great country.  The success of our democracy according \nto Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational \nsystem.\n\t     \n\t     His philosophy of government, his belief in the \nimportance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest \nhere this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us \nPresident Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in \nthe Chamber of Commerce studios.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for \ntaking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \nnetwork and we welcome you here this evening.\n\t     \n\t     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \nAnd, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \nalso.\n\t     \n\t     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \nmany of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \nyou'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \nWashington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\n\t     \n\t     I believe the President has a few words that he might \nwant to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \nat this time.  It's great to have you.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\n\t     \n\t     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \nReich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \nChamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \nalong with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \ntonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \nfrom school to the work place.\n\t     \n\t     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \nrecognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \neconomy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \nwork together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \nmake things happen.\n\t     \n\t     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \nkind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \nstate pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \nCorporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \nseveral hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \nappreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \nthe rest of you.\n\t     \n\t     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \nconstructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \nthis being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \nbelieved in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \neducation; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \nfreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \nthird, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \n\t     \n\t     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \nbeautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \ncherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \nwith changing times.\n\t     \n\t     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \nand increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \ncan compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\nabout what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \nwe do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \ngovernment, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \nour investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \nlong run.\n\t     \n\t     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \nAnd in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \nor eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \nand continues into the work force where education must go on for a \nlifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \nlearn.\n\t     \n\t     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \nwe're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \nbetween the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \nprivate sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \ntrying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \nwould create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \nthousands that have a strong education component so our young people \ncan be learning and working at the same time.\n\t     \n\t     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \nplace we can begin, I think, the discussion.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\n\t     \n\t     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \ncitizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \ntonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \ncan prepare students for this world of work.\n\t     \n\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \nDepartment are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \nSummer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \nThe aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \nproposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \njobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \nareas of the country.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \nsomewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \nfor more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \nwords is that so important?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \nFirst of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \nhave had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \nthem to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \ncontinue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \nresearch that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \nforget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \nover the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \nschools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \ntaught before.\n\t     \n\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \nnot only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \nabolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \nlearning because we think that the best and most productive workers \nwill have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \ncould maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \nsucceed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \ndisadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \ninto the next year, is really even greater.  \n\t     \n\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \nthroughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \neducational component of training.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \nSecretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \nor for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \neducation is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \nfor example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \ngeometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \nworking on something, and they can see the exact and direct \napplication of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \nlot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \neducation and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \nIt's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \nyoung people even beyond the summer.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \nprogram, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \nus a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \ndeveloping.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \nit's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \nwill not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \nrequire some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \nget in a high school diploma.  \n\t     \n\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \nof young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \neducation was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \npeople who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \ngo up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \nthey weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \nemployers.\n\t     \n\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \ntrying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \nbut don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \ntwo years of further training either in a community college, a \nvocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \nthis budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \nfunds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \nand with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \na way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \nbased on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \nrevolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \nthe earnings of American workers.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \nyou know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \npeople watching this program -- that the business community and \neducators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \nof our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \nfact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \npeople watching this program probably are the ones who are most \ndirectly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \nand I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \nalready out there.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \nabout youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \ncareer academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \nwith this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \nthese school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \nyou and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \nlonger than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \ncommunity is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \ndoing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \nChamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \nkinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \naimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\n\t     \n\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \nin developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \nhelping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \ndevelop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\n\t     \n\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \none of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \nplayers in a community come together and work together and cooperate \ntogether.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \nthe business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \nis talking, but they're not really working together in a common \nstrategy.\n\t     \n\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \nwould be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \nexcellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \ntracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \nmake it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \neligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \ncollege, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \ntalking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \nskills for on-the-job learning.\n\t     \n\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \nalready being done.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \npoint based on my personal experience at home -- the business \ncommunity has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \nthe job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \nbut also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \nof partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \ngoing to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \nsecond-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \ninfluence them.  So I think that's very important.\n\t     \n\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \nthe federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \nfunds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \nsure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \nquality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \ndetermine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \ncourse, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \nprogram for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \nlong-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \nPresident, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \ncommunities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \ncoming forth before too long.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \nwere both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \nschools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \na lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \n\t     \n\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \nthat the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \nBush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \ndo this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \nCongress that will actually define the things that the national \ngovernment ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \nchildren of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \ngoals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \nready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \ngraduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \nconfident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \nsecond to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \ndisciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \nthem out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \nlife-long learning in this country.\n\t     \n\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \nstate role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \nrole.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \nintroduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \nand then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \nis and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \nthat we need to meet.\n\t     \n\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \nlike it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \nNot mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \nmoney, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \npartnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \nit will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \nof its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \nsupport and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \nefforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\n\t     \n\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \nthe telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \ncourse, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \nI wonder if you would comment on that.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \nour young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \ndon't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \nof community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \nnational skill standards to which they could aspire and which \nemployers would understand as a national credential, many of these \nyoung people would actually find that they were much more eligible \nfor jobs.\n\t     \n\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \ncountries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \ncollege, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \ntechnical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \nyou don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \ndevelop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \nwith the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \nindustry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \nkinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \ninstitutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \nahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \nTodd of Austin, Texas.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \nRiley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \nhave some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \nhave heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \nsimply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \nmuch of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \nvery supportive.  \n\t     \n\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \nsummer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \nhave over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \nas 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \n\t     \n\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \nanswered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \nthe question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \nwould be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \nis even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \nlevel might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\nround basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \nlocal community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \nsomething that we believe is very important to success in this \neffort.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \nanswer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \nand thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \nI've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \n\t     \n\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \nstructure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \nprogram and that will move a lot of these young people back into \nschools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \nthe private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \ntry to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \nto be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \nworking on that.\n\t     \n\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \nCongress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \nbuild in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \ntraining programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \nheavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \nasked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \nhope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \ntrained on a year-round basis.\n\t     \n\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \na moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \nas work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \nactually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \nthey're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \nhope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \nwe hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \ncuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \nraisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \nable to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\n\t     \n\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \nof my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \nand that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \nschool for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \naddition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \njobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \nIt's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \neconomy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \nelse.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \nthink this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \nthink is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \ngreater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \nto be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \nright, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \nwill be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \nnext year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \nwill be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \ntogether to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \nthen the state, with all the various school districts, a very \nimportant part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \nthink everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \nmoving.\n\t     \n\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \n\t     \n\t     Doctor?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \nbe on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \nand work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \nits inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \nalternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \nwe have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \nextremely effective learning strategy.\n\t     \n\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \nseveral principles that are very important in bridging the school and \nwork.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \npractice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \nto careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \nupon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \nlastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \ndevelopment of high performance competencies.  \n\t     \n\t     My question, then is:  How can the general education \nfaculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \ntransition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \ncan you suggest to achieve this integration?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \nand we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \nwork going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \nguests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \nin that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \nthem and we can discuss it later.\n\t     \n\t     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \nthing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \nclear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \npeople who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \nexplicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \nis very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \nwhat I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \nvocational learning and what is academic learning.\n\t     \n\t     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \nwe should have a strong component for people who are in the \nvocational program.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \nrethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \nwork combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \nimportant for all students.  It's not just a special group of \nstudents that needs them.\n\t     \n\t     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \nStates -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \nexperiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \n12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \nand then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \nto college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \ncan go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \ncareer directions.\n\t     \n\t     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \ngoes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\nrelated work within the classroom, within our schools.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \ngoing to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \nthink you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \nyou and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and \nyour ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \n\n                                 END9:00 P.M.

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you \nin the thousands of communities around the country that are taking \npart in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.\n\t     \n\t     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas \nJefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to \nmention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he \nhas been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all \nfollowed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education \nhere in this great country.  The success of our democracy according \nto Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational \nsystem.\n\t     \n\t     His philosophy of government, his belief in the \nimportance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest \nhere this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us \nPresident Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in \nthe Chamber of Commerce studios.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for \ntaking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \nnetwork and we welcome you here this evening.\n\t     \n\t     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \nAnd, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \nalso.\n\t     \n\t     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \nmany of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \nyou'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \nWashington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\n\t     \n\t     I believe the President has a few words that he might \nwant to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \nat this time.  It's great to have you.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\n\t     \n\t     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \nReich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \nChamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \nalong with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \ntonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \nfrom school to the work place.\n\t     \n\t     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \nrecognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \neconomy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \nwork together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \nmake things happen.\n\t     \n\t     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \nkind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \nstate pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \nCorporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \nseveral hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \nappreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \nthe rest of you.\n\t     \n\t     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \nconstructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \nthis being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \nbelieved in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \neducation; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \nfreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \nthird, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \n\t     \n\t     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \nbeautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \ncherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \nwith changing times.\n\t     \n\t     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \nand increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \ncan compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\nabout what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \nwe do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \ngovernment, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \nour investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \nlong run.\n\t     \n\t     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \nAnd in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \nor eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \nand continues into the work force where education must go on for a \nlifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \nlearn.\n\t     \n\t     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \nwe're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \nbetween the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \nprivate sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \ntrying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \nwould create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \nthousands that have a strong education component so our young people \ncan be learning and working at the same time.\n\t     \n\t     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \nplace we can begin, I think, the discussion.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\n\t     \n\t     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \ncitizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \ntonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \ncan prepare students for this world of work.\n\t     \n\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \nDepartment are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \nSummer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \nThe aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \nproposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \njobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \nareas of the country.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \nsomewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \nfor more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \nwords is that so important?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \nFirst of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \nhave had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \nthem to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \ncontinue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \nresearch that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \nforget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \nover the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \nschools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \ntaught before.\n\t     \n\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \nnot only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \nabolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \nlearning because we think that the best and most productive workers \nwill have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \ncould maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \nsucceed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \ndisadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \ninto the next year, is really even greater.  \n\t     \n\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \nthroughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \neducational component of training.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \nSecretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \nor for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \neducation is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \nfor example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \ngeometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \nworking on something, and they can see the exact and direct \napplication of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \nlot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \neducation and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \nIt's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \nyoung people even beyond the summer.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \nprogram, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \nus a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \ndeveloping.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \nit's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \nwill not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \nrequire some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \nget in a high school diploma.  \n\t     \n\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \nof young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \neducation was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \npeople who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \ngo up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \nthey weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \nemployers.\n\t     \n\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \ntrying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \nbut don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \ntwo years of further training either in a community college, a \nvocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \nthis budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \nfunds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \nand with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \na way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \nbased on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \nrevolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \nthe earnings of American workers.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \nyou know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \npeople watching this program -- that the business community and \neducators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \nof our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \nfact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \npeople watching this program probably are the ones who are most \ndirectly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \nand I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \nalready out there.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \nabout youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \ncareer academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \nwith this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \nthese school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \nyou and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \nlonger than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \ncommunity is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \ndoing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \nChamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \nkinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \naimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\n\t     \n\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \nin developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \nhelping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \ndevelop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\n\t     \n\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \none of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \nplayers in a community come together and work together and cooperate \ntogether.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \nthe business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \nis talking, but they're not really working together in a common \nstrategy.\n\t     \n\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \nwould be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \nexcellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \ntracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \nmake it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \neligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \ncollege, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \ntalking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \nskills for on-the-job learning.\n\t     \n\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \nalready being done.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \npoint based on my personal experience at home -- the business \ncommunity has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \nthe job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \nbut also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \nof partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \ngoing to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \nsecond-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \ninfluence them.  So I think that's very important.\n\t     \n\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \nthe federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \nfunds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \nsure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \nquality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \ndetermine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \ncourse, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \nprogram for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \nlong-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \nPresident, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \ncommunities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \ncoming forth before too long.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \nwere both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \nschools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \na lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \n\t     \n\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \nthat the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \nBush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \ndo this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \nCongress that will actually define the things that the national \ngovernment ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \nchildren of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \ngoals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \nready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \ngraduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \nconfident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \nsecond to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \ndisciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \nthem out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \nlife-long learning in this country.\n\t     \n\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \nstate role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \nrole.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \nintroduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \nand then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \nis and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \nthat we need to meet.\n\t     \n\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \nlike it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \nNot mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \nmoney, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \npartnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \nit will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \nof its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \nsupport and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \nefforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\n\t     \n\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \nthe telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \ncourse, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \nI wonder if you would comment on that.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \nour young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \ndon't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \nof community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \nnational skill standards to which they could aspire and which \nemployers would understand as a national credential, many of these \nyoung people would actually find that they were much more eligible \nfor jobs.\n\t     \n\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \ncountries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \ncollege, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \ntechnical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \nyou don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \ndevelop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \nwith the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \nindustry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \nkinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \ninstitutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \nahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \nTodd of Austin, Texas.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \nRiley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \nhave some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \nhave heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \nsimply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \nmuch of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \nvery supportive.  \n\t     \n\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \nsummer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \nhave over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \nas 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \n\t     \n\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \nanswered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \nthe question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \nwould be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \nis even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \nlevel might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\nround basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \nlocal community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \nsomething that we believe is very important to success in this \neffort.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \nanswer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \nand thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \nI've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \n\t     \n\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \nstructure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \nprogram and that will move a lot of these young people back into \nschools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \nthe private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \ntry to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \nto be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \nworking on that.\n\t     \n\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \nCongress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \nbuild in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \ntraining programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \nheavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \nasked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \nhope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \ntrained on a year-round basis.\n\t     \n\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \na moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \nas work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \nactually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \nthey're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \nhope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \nwe hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \ncuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \nraisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \nable to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\n\t     \n\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \nof my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \nand that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \nschool for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \naddition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \njobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \nIt's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \neconomy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \nelse.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \nthink this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \nthink is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \ngreater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \nto be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \nright, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \nwill be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \nnext year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \nwill be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \ntogether to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \nthen the state, with all the various school districts, a very \nimportant part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \nthink everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \nmoving.\n\t     \n\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \n\t     \n\t     Doctor?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \nbe on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \nand work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \nits inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \nalternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \nwe have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \nextremely effective learning strategy.\n\t     \n\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \nseveral principles that are very important in bridging the school and \nwork.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \npractice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \nto careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \nupon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \nlastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \ndevelopment of high performance competencies.  \n\t     \n\t     My question, then is:  How can the general education \nfaculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \ntransition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \ncan you suggest to achieve this integration?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \nand we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \nwork going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \nguests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \nin that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \nthem and we can discuss it later.\n\t     \n\t     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \nthing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \nclear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \npeople who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \nexplicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \nis very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \nwhat I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \nvocational learning and what is academic learning.\n\t     \n\t     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \nwe should have a strong component for people who are in the \nvocational program.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \nrethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \nwork combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \nimportant for all students.  It's not just a special group of \nstudents that needs them.\n\t     \n\t     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \nStates -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \nexperiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \n12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \nand then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \nto college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \ncan go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \ncareer directions.\n\t     \n\t     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \ngoes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\nrelated work within the classroom, within our schools.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \ngoing to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \nthink you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \nyou and Secretary Reich for being here.

\n吉乐岛，位于太平洋，本来是一处没有人烟的荒岛，可是在最近一段时间，却突然兴旺起来。\n因为有个人把它买了下来，这个人就是谢文东。\n吉乐岛以前叫什么名字，他不知道，也不想知道，现在，他把它改名为吉乐，这是他和他的亲人、朋友的吉乐地带。\n谢文东到这里度假，或者说到这里来避难，已经有几个月的时间，过着神仙般的生活。\n在吉乐岛上，他并不寂寞，他的家人，他喜爱的人，都在这里，当然，也不缺少他的朋友。\n当谢文东初次来吉乐岛时，这还是一处未进行任何过开发的未知领域，当然，只要有钱，世界上没有多少事是办不成的。\n他在这里新建了第一栋别墅。很快，他的得力部下，也是他的兄弟，李爽也来了，而且不是一个人，还带来了他的家人。他对谢文东说：“这个小岛太荒凉，让伯父伯母两位老两口住在这里孤单寂寞，所以把自己家人带来，是为了让伯父伯母能找到说话谈心的人。”他的鬼心眼哪能瞒过谢文东的眼睛，傻子都知道，他在黑道混，怕仇家找上自己的家人，与其在中国过提心吊胆的日子，还不如到吉乐岛过无忧无虑、舒心的生活。而且别看李爽平时傻糊糊的，心里精明的很，他明白一个道理，谢文东在的地方，一定很安全，家人到这生活，一定不会出事。\n不管李爽是怎么打算的，谢文东欣然接受，在自家别墅旁边，又新建一栋。\n竣工之后，李爽高高兴兴把自己家人送过来，搬进别墅里。他在吉乐岛住了半个月时间，受不了这里无聊的生活，和谢文东打声招呼，又回中国了。\n李爽开了个好头！他是第一个，很快高强也来了。高强为人寡言，不象李爽那么能胡诌，当谢文东问他原因时，他只说两个字：“安全！”\n短短几个月时间，原本荒凉的小岛变的热闹起来，大兴土木，施工不断，刚开始的一栋别墅也变成现在近二十栋之多，文东会和原北洪门的许多骨干都效仿李爽和高强，把家人送到吉乐岛。\n谢文东原本以为自己可以在吉乐岛上安安稳稳地享受一段平静的生活，哪想到几个月下来，自己快变成‘包工头’了。\n白天，海边的沙滩上总是能看到身穿游装的中年男人在晒太阳，即使到晚上，时常也有大规模的聚会。\n当任长风来吉乐岛之前，一度以为谢文东在此地过着的是枯涩日子，可是当他坐着直升飞机，快接近目的地时，被岛上那一片花花绿绿的别墅吓了一跳，特别是在岛屿另一侧，竟然还兴建了一座码头，码头边旁若无人的停靠着一艘小型军舰。\n直升飞机缓缓停在岛屿东侧的停机坪上，他弯腰跳下飞机，终于看到多日未见、朝思暮想的谢文东。\n任长风为人清高，性格向来孤傲，除了他自己，能被他放在眼中的没几个，谢文东绝对是那没几个里的重中之重。\n没等说话，他眼圈一红，眼中先一片晶莹，双唇蠕动，一肚子话此时却一个字都说不出来。\n谢文东很喜欢任长风这个人，第一，他能力出众，本事过人，若论单打独斗，无论是北洪门还是文东会，每几个人能与他匹敌，第二，他的性情也十分让谢文东欣赏。\n见到他，谢文东当然甚是高兴，不等任长风说话，先笑眯眯地把他拉上一辆敞棚的吉普车，笑道：“有话，我们回家再说！”\n任长风坐上车，偷眼打量身旁的谢文东。他还是老样子，没什么太多变化，相貌依然清秀，身材依然消瘦，细长的眼睛弯弯的眯缝着，若说有变化，是他面颊比以前红润了一些，看起来更加健康。\n“我的变化大吗？”谢文东靠着椅子，仰面望天，笑眯眯地问道。他并没有看任长风，但却知道他在打量自己。\n唉！任长风叹口气，和东哥在一起，是毫无秘密而言的。很多没见过谢文东的人向他询问，谢文东究竟是什么样子的，他的回答是：“他有一双望穿秋水的眼睛，他有一种洞彻人心的眼神。”他笑道：“东哥的变化不大，看起来比以前更精神了。”\n“哈哈！”谢文东大笑，让任长风这样高傲的人说出恭维的话，无论怎么听都觉得别扭。\n任长风老脸一红，顿了一下，又道：“可是北洪门的变化太大了。”\n自谢文东走后，南北洪门停战，不久之后，达成联盟，虽然没有统一，但名称上已经没有南北之分，都叫洪门。\n至于盟主，由原南北洪门的老大共同担任。南洪门自然是向问天了，北洪门这边，由于谢文东出国，金老爷子退隐，一切都由东心雷做主，所以，洪门是由向问天和东心雷来主导。\n由于东心雷在智谋上弱于向问天，谢文东给他的建议是，他这个洪门老大只是名义上的，是为了安抚原北洪门的那些人，至于洪门大小的事务，应交由向问天做主。东心雷对谢文东的话言听计从，心甘情愿做了名义上的老大。现在的洪门，实际上是掌握在向问天的手里。而任长风做为原北洪门的骨干，和向问天争斗多年，从本质上，看不起他和南洪门那些干部，要他与这些人一起共事，对他来说实在是种煎熬。\n他这次来吉乐岛，就没打算回去。反正他孤家寡人一个，走到哪，哪就是家。\n谢文东知道他说的话是什么意思，别看他远离中国，但对洪门的事却了如指掌。他说道：“向问天是个英雄，把北洪门交给他，他不会排除异己，也不会生出事端，而且，以他的为人和能力，会把洪门带来一个好的发展前景。”\n任长风点点头，他心中也明白这个道理，可就是无法接受。\n吉普车在一座白色的别墅前停下，两人还没下车，已有四男两女从房中迎出来。\n任长风抬目一瞧，笑了，这六位他不仅认识，还是熟人。五行兄弟和小风，他自然不会陌生。\n见小风身着家居便装，腰间系围裙，一付家庭主妇的模样，任长风脸上笑容加深，半开玩笑道：“小风这身打扮倒是让人眼前一亮啊！”小风身为谢文东的贴身保镖，身手相当了得，别看人长得美艳漂亮，但动起手来，素有‘疯子’之称。\n小风撇撇嘴，白了他一眼，嘴唇挑了挑，不知道在嘟囔什么。\n任长风大笑两声，目光一转，打量起五行兄弟，这五人一各个红光满面，显然这一阵子睡得好，吃的香，没少享受清福。\n几人热情地打过招呼后，进入别墅。\n大厅内正有一条倩影在忙前忙后，向桌子上端饭菜，这位动人的女郎任长风也认识，她是彭玲。\n任长风没等脱鞋，先客客气气地叫一声：“嫂子好！”\n彭玲玉面一红，看看一旁的谢文东，招呼道：“快近来坐吧！”\n谢文东哈哈一笑，拍拍任长风肩膀，道：“别客气！”说着，来到彭玲身旁，笑呵呵看着桌上饭菜，笑道：“挺丰盛的嘛！”\n彭玲脸上露出妩媚的娇笑。高家两姐妹在中国读书，而金蓉在国外上学，平时照顾谢文东起居的都是彭玲，这段时间里，也是彭玲一直陪伴在他左右。\n任长风坐在沙发上，环视一圈，好奇地问道：“怎么没看到伯父伯母呢？”\n谢文东笑道：“我爸妈住在后面的别墅里。”\n“哦！”任长风点点头。谢文东又道：“你住的地方我也准备好了，一会带你去看看。”\n“谢谢！”任长风心中倍感温暖。\n“客气什么？！”谢文东笑道：“我们是兄弟嘛！”\n他一句简单的兄弟，却让任长风甚是受用。吃饭中，他想起自己来时看到的军舰，好奇地问道：“东哥，刚才我在飞机上，看到岛上还停有军舰，那是怎么回事？”\n谢文东大笑道：“那是我向黑带买的。本来想买艘游艇，可是黑带没有，就给我弄来一艘这个东西。”\n军舰？游艇？这完全是两种性质嘛！谢文东说的轻描淡写，但任长风却暗暗佩服，俄罗斯的军舰，可是一般人有钱都买不来的，虽然只是小型号的。\n水镜老神在在道：“我们现在都把它当游艇用，没事时可以用它出海钓鱼！”\n扑！任长风差点喷饭，用军舰钓鱼？还真是第一次听说过。\n吃过饭后，谢文东带任长风到海边散步，小风远远在后面跟着。\n夕阳西下，落日映红天边和海角，清新的海风迎面扑来，让人浑身凉爽，有种说不出的舒适。岛屿的宁静，环境的美丽，让长时间生活在喧嚣都市的任长风仿佛置身于世外逃园。\n踩着柔软的沙滩，任长风幽幽叹息一声，问道：“东哥打算回国吗？”\n谢文东停下脚步，面对大海，说道：“回去，是一定要回去的，但不是现在。”\n任长风精神一振，忙问道：“那是什么时候？”\n谢文东摇摇头，道：“我不知道！即使现在回去，恐怕也难有什么作为，南北洪门已经达成联盟，实际上已经是统一了，我回去，又能做些什么呢？”\n任长风道：“可以挤掉向问天！偌大的洪门，怎能让他一人独有！？”\n谢文东微微一笑，背手望着夕阳，轻声说道：“再耀眼的骄阳，也有落下来的时候，何况是人呢？”\n任长风琢磨着他的话，正想发问，谢文东转头问道：“听说，现在有崛起一个新帮派，叫青帮。”\n“是的！”任长风点头道：“他们自称祖师爷是杜月笙，在全国很多地方都设有分堂，只是东哥在时，他们还没有浮出水面，只是在东哥走后不久，青帮突然变的高调起来，最近，和台洪门闹的不可开交。”\n谢文东挑眉问道：“青帮的势力已延伸到台湾了？”\n任长风道：“他们在台湾确实有很大的分堂，有消息说，他们本来就是从台湾兴起的，后来才发展到大陆。不过，青帮的总部在中国，这倒是真的。”\n“恩！”谢文东仰面，心中默默琢磨着。任长风的话，和暗组给自己的消息基本上差不多，以此来看，洪门和青帮的碰撞是迟早的事情，毕竟中国只有一个，地下的皇帝也只能有一个！\n他轻轻扣打额头，问道：“长风，你说如果现在的洪门和青帮打起来，谁会赢？”\n给你一段话，帮我续写\n“啊！是这样啊！”谢文东哈哈大笑，拍着马戈伊的肩膀说道：“马戈伊先生肯来帮我，我很高兴，我欢迎还来不及，怎么可能会不接受呢？！”\n安人运和安盟停止内战，国家统一，原安人运官员的职位或多或少都得到了提升，象皮龙·内贝那样麻雀变凤凰的更不在少数，但这位帕非·马戈伊却倒霉的很，职位一直都没有变动，被压得死死的，也正是因为这样，他才心灰意冷，将目光瞄向了在安哥拉势力越来越大的谢文东。\n他的到来，也为谢文东在安哥拉的地位带来了新的飞跃。\n用帕非·马戈伊自己的话讲，他会最大限度的利用谢文东手中现有的优势将谢文东塑造成安哥拉的地下之王，左右安哥拉未来的命运。\n第307章\n帕非·马戈伊来投靠自己，谢文东非常欢迎的，目前他在安哥拉也确实缺少这样一个人，另外还有最主要的一点，帕非·马戈伊能说一口流利的汉语，思想也很中国化，这是谢文东最喜欢的。\n见自己提出的要求马上被谢文东接受了，马戈伊也十分高兴，连声道谢，随后，他说道：“安盟作为一个大的动派，想要生存，甚至想要成为执政动，必须得有雄厚的资金作为基础，这也是安盟目前最缺少的，谢先生想得到他们的支持，其实很简单，只要向他们提供足够多的政治资金即可。”\n“哦！”谢文东揉着下巴，陷入沉思，过了半响，他幽幽说道：“如此来说，是需要花费不少钱的。”\n“呵呵！”马戈伊笑了，说道：“如果谢先生真得到了石油区的开采权，其中的利润可比安盟提供政治资金要多得多，而且谢先生每年都会通过国家银行分得红利，只需要拿出其中的一小部分，便足以让安盟对谢先生言听计从了！”\n\n[要求]

In comparison, in \nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \nrespectively). Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \n\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.

The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \nand gang affiliation. The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \nand health-care providers. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \nstudy. Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \nby p values of less than 0.05. Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \n(no-law states). Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \n43.2%, respectively). High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \n\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \ndirected at parents with young children. Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance \nin metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for \nthe years 1983-1988. Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program \nand the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-\nbased surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The \nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \npool, or random variation. Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance \nconducted from October 1988 through May 1989. Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices \nof 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO \ncollaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza \nviruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and \nterritorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians. \nNonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received \nthroughout the year. Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B \nviruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency \noverall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted \nover the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices \nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \nA(H1N1). Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \nAuthors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona\n\n                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies\n\nFollowing the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-\nET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been \ndeveloped that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT), \nembryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together, \nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \ntechnology (ART) procedures. \n\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \n\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \ntraditional therapies. \n\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \n\no in vitro \no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \n  transfer \no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \ntowards improved success of these technologies. \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                           Future Areas of Research\n\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \ndisease. \n\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \n\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \nsex-linked disorders. \n\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \nof affected children. \n\n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, Arizona\n\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for theManagement of Infertility\n\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \n\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \ntraditional therapies. The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \n\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \nand/or idiopathic infertility.    The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \nthrough enzymatic digestion. Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \nestablish conception. \n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \n--------- end of part 2 ------------\n\n---Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na\n\n[Requirement] Rewrite the email in an informal and engaging style.

In comparison, in \nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \nrespectively). Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \n\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \nPrevention Svcs, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \nand gang affiliation. The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \nand health-care providers. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \nstudy. Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \nby p values of less than 0.05. Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \n(no-law states). Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \n43.2%, respectively). High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \n\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \ndirected at parents with young children. Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance \nin metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for \nthe years 1983-1988. Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program \nand the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-\nbased surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The \nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \npool, or random variation. Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance \nconducted from October 1988 through May 1989. Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices \nof 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO \ncollaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza \nviruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and \nterritorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians. \nNonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received \nthroughout the year. Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B \nviruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency \noverall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted \nover the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices \nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \nA(H1N1). Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \nAuthors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona\n\n                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies\n\nFollowing the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-\nET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been \ndeveloped that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT), \nembryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together, \nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \ntechnology (ART) procedures. \n\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \n\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \ntraditional therapies. \n\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \n\no in vitro \no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \n  transfer \no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \ntowards improved success of these technologies. \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                           Future Areas of Research\n\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \ndisease. \n\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \n\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \nsex-linked disorders. \n\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \nof affected children. \n\n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, Arizona\n\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for theManagement of Infertility\n\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \n\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \ntraditional therapies. The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \n\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \nand/or idiopathic infertility.    The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \nthrough enzymatic digestion. Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \nestablish conception. \n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \n--------- end of part 2 ------------\n\n---Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na"}

In comparison, in \nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \nrespectively). Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \n\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \nPrevention Svcs, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \nand gang affiliation. The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \nand health-care providers. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \nstudy. Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \nby p values of less than 0.05. Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \n(no-law states). Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \n43.2%, respectively). High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \n\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \ndirected at parents with young children. Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance \nin metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for \nthe years 1983-1988. Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program \nand the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-\nbased surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The \nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \npool, or random variation. Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance \nconducted from October 1988 through May 1989. Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices \nof 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO \ncollaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza \nviruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and \nterritorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians. \nNonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received \nthroughout the year. Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B \nviruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency \noverall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted \nover the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices \nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \nA(H1N1). Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \nAuthors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona\n\n                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies\n\nFollowing the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-\nET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been \ndeveloped that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT), \nembryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together, \nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \ntechnology (ART) procedures. \n\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \n\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \ntraditional therapies. \n\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \n\no in vitro \no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \n  transfer \no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \ntowards improved success of these technologies. \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                           Future Areas of Research\n\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \ndisease. \n\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \n\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \nsex-linked disorders. \n\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \nof affected children. \n\n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, Arizona\n\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for theManagement of Infertility\n\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \n\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \ntraditional therapies. The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \n\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \nand/or idiopathic infertility.    The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \nthrough enzymatic digestion. Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \nestablish conception. \n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \n--------- end of part 2 ------------\n\n---Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na\n\n[Requirement] Rewrite the email in an informal and engaging style.

In comparison, in \nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \nrespectively). Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \n\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.

The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \nand gang affiliation. The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \nand health-care providers. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \nstudy. Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \nby p values of less than 0.05. Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \n(no-law states). Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \n43.2%, respectively). High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \n\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \ndirected at parents with young children. Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance \nin metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for \nthe years 1983-1988. Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program \nand the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-\nbased surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The \nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \npool, or random variation. Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance \nconducted from October 1988 through May 1989. Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices \nof 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO \ncollaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza \nviruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and \nterritorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians. \nNonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received \nthroughout the year. Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B \nviruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency \noverall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted \nover the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices \nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \nA(H1N1). Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \nAuthors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona\n\n                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies\n\nFollowing the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-\nET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been \ndeveloped that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT), \nembryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together, \nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \ntechnology (ART) procedures. \n\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \n\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \ntraditional therapies. \n\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \n\no in vitro \no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \n  transfer \no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \ntowards improved success of these technologies. \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                           Future Areas of Research\n\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \ndisease. \n\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \n\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \nsex-linked disorders. \n\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \nof affected children. \n\n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, Arizona\n\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for theManagement of Infertility\n\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \n\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \ntraditional therapies. The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \n\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \nand/or idiopathic infertility.    The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \nthrough enzymatic digestion. Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \nestablish conception. \n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \n--------- end of part 2 ------------\n\n---Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na"}

learning , yeah . professor a : that 's that 's great . phd g : yeah . phd c : yeah . professor a : do we have an agenda ? liz liz and andreas ca n't sh ca n't uh , ca n't come . grad b : i do . professor a : so , they wo n't be here . grad b : i have agenda and it 's all me . phd g : did grad b : cuz no one sent me anything else . phd g : did they send , uh , the messages to you about the meeting today ? grad b : i have no idea but i just got it a few minutes ago . right when you were in my office it arrived . phd g : oh . ok , cuz i checked my mail . i did n't have anything . grad b : so , does anyone have any a agenda items other than me ? i actually have one more also which is to talk about the digits . professor a : uh , right , so so i i was just gon na talk briefly about the nsf itr . phd c : mm - hmm . yeah . grad b : oh , great . professor a : uh , and then , you have i mean , i wo n't say much , but { comment } uh , but then , uh , you said wan na talk about digits ? grad b : i have a short thing about digits and then uh i wan na talk a little bit about naming conventions , although it 's unclear whether this is the right place to talk about it . so maybe just talk about it very briefly and take the details to the people who for whom it 's relevant . professor a : right . phd c : yeah . postdoc f : i could always say something about transcription . i 've been but but uh , well professor a : well if we yeah , we should n't add things in just to add things in . i 'm actually pretty busy today , postdoc f : yeah . professor a : so if we can { comment } we postdoc f : yeah , yeah , yeah . professor a : a short meeting would be fine . postdoc f : this does sound like we 're doing fine , yeah . that wo n't do . grad b : so the only thing i wan na say about digits is , we are pretty much done with the first test set . there are probably forms here and there that are marked as having been read that were n't really read . so i wo n't really know until i go through all the transcriber forms and extract out pieces that are in error . so i wa uh . two things . the first is what should we do about digits that were misread ? my opinion is , um , we should just throw them out completely , and have them read again by someone else . you know , the grouping is completely random , phd c : uh - huh . grad b : so it it 's perfectly fine to put a a group together again of errors and have them re - read , just to finish out the test set . postdoc f : oh ! by throw them out completely ? grad b : um , the other thing you could do is change the transcript to match what they really said . so those are those are the two options . phd c : yeah . postdoc f : mm - hmm . professor a : but there 's often things where people do false starts . i know i 've done it , where i say say a grad b : what the transcribers did with that is if they did a correction , and they eventually did read the right string , { comment } you extract the right string . phd g : oh , you 're talking about where they completely read the wrong string and did n't correct it ? phd e : yeah . grad b : yeah . and did n't notice . which happens in a few places . phd e : yeah . phd c : yeah . grad b : so so postdoc f : well , and s and you 're talking string - wise , you 're not talking about the entire page ? grad b : correct . phd e : yeah . postdoc f : i get it . grad b : and so the the two options are change the transcript to match what they really said , but then but then the transcript is n't the aurora test set anymore . i do n't think that really matters because the conditions are so different . and that would be a little easier . phd g : well how many are how how often does that happen ? grad b : mmm , five or six times . phd g : oh , so it 's not very much . grad b : no , it 's not much at all . phd g : seems like we should just change the transcripts phd e : yeah . phd g : to match . professor a : yeah , it 's five or six times out of thousands ? phd c : yeah . grad b : four thousand . professor a : four thousand ? phd c : four thous ah ! four thousand . phd g : yeah , it 's professor a : yeah , i would , uh , tak do the easy way , phd g : yeah . professor a : yeah . phd c : yeah . professor a : it it 's kinda nice i mean , wh who knows what studies people will be doing on on speaker - dependent things and so i think having having it all phd c : yeah . professor a : the speakers who we had is is at least interesting . phd g : so you um , how many digits have been transcribed now ? grad b : four thousand lines . and each line is between one and about ten digits . phd g : four thousand lines ? grad b : i did n't i did n't compute the average . i think the average was around four or five . professor a : so that 's a couple hours of of , uh , speech , probably . grad b : yep . yep . professor a : which is a yeah reasonable reasonable test set . phd c : mm - hmm . phd g : mm - hmm . grad b : and , jane , i do have a set of forms which i think you have copies of somewhere . postdoc f : mm - hmm . yeah , true . grad b : oh you do ? oh ok , good , good . postdoc f : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad b : yeah , i was just wond i thought i had had all of them back from you . and then the other thing is that , uh , the forms in front of us here that we 're gon na read later , were suggested by liz postdoc f : no , not yet . grad b : because she wanted to elicit some different prosodics from digits . and so , uh , i just wanted people to , take a quick look at the instructions phd c : mm - hmm . phd e : eight eight two two two nine . grad b : and the way it wa worked and see if it makes sense and if anyone has any comments on it . professor a : i see . and the decision here , uh , was to continue with uh the words rather than the the numerics . grad b : uh , yes , although we could switch it back . the problem was o and zero . although we could switch it back and tell them always to say `` zero `` or always to say `` o `` . postdoc f : oh professor a : or neither . phd c : yeah . professor a : but it 's just two thing ways that you can say it . grad b : mm - hmm . professor a : right ? grad b : sure . professor a : um um , phd e : yeah . professor a : that 's the only thought i have because if you t start talking about these , you know u tr she 's trying to get at natural groupings , but it there 's there 's nothing natural about reading numbers this way . grad b : right . professor a : i mean if you saw a telephone number you would never see it this way . grad b : the the problem also is she did want to stick with digits . i mean i 'm speaking for her since she 's not here . professor a : yeah . grad b : but , um , the other problem we were thinking about is if you just put the numerals , { comment } they might say forty - three instead of four three . phd e : yeah . phd c : yeah . phd e : yeah . phd c : yeah . postdoc f : well , if there 's space , though , between them . i mean , you can with when you space them out they do n't look like , uh , forty - three anymore . phd e : yeah . grad b : well , she and i were talking about it , professor a : yeah . grad b : and she felt that it 's very , very natural to do that sort of chunking . professor a : she 's right . it 's it it 's a different problem . i mean it 's a it 's a it 's an interesting problem i mean , we 've done stuff with numbers before , and yeah sometimes people if you say s `` three nine eight one `` sometimes people will say `` thirty - nine eighty - one `` or `` three hundred three hundred eighty - nine one `` , or i do n't think they 'd say that , phd c : yeah . professor a : but but th grad b : not very frequently professor a : no grad b : but , they certainly could . professor a : but yeah . uh , th thirty - eight ninety - one is probably how they 'd do it . grad b : so . i mean , this is something that liz and i spoke about professor a : but i see . grad b : and , since this was something that liz asked for specifically , i think we need to defer to her . professor a : mm - hmm . phd c : yeah . professor a : ok . well , we 're probably gon na be collecting meetings for a while and if we decide we still wan na do some digits later we might be able to do some different ver different versions , grad b : do something different , professor a : but this is the next suggestion , grad b : yeah . professor a : so . ok . ok , so uh e l i guess , let me , uh , get my my short thing out about the nsf . i sent this actually this is maybe a little side thing . um , i i sent to what i thought we had , uh , in some previous mail , as the right joint thing to send to , which was `` m mtg rcdr hyphen joint `` . grad b : it was . joint . yep . professor a : but then i got some sort of funny mail saying that the moderator was going to grad b : it 's that 's because they set the one up at uw that 's not on our side , that 's on the u - dub { comment } side . and so u - uw set it up as a moderated list . postdoc f : yeah . professor a : oh , ok . grad b : and , i have no idea whether it actually ever goes to anyone so you might just wan na mail to mari professor a : no no , th i got i got , uh , little excited notes from mari and jeff and so on , grad b : and professor a : so it 's grad b : ok , good . professor a : yeah . grad b : so the moderator actually did repost it . professor a : yeah . grad b : cuz i had sent one earlier actually the same thing happened to me i had sent one earlier . the message says , `` you 'll be informed `` and then i was never informed but i got replies from people indicating that they had gotten it , so . professor a : right . grad b : it 's just to prevent spam . professor a : i see . yeah so o ok . well , anyway , i guess everybody here are y are you are on that list , right ? so you got the note ? phd g : mm - hmm . professor a : yeah ? ok . phd g : yeah . professor a : um , so this was , uh , a , uh , proposal that we put in before on on more more higher level , uh , issues in meetings , from i guess higher level from my point of view . uh , and , uh , meeting mappings , and , uh so is i for it was a proposal for the itr program , uh , information technology research program 's part of national science foundation . it 's the second year of their doing , uh , these grants . they 're they 're a lot of them are some of them anyway , are larger larger grants than the usual , small nsf grants , and . so , they 're very competitive , and they have a first phase where you put in pre - proposals , and we we , uh , got through that . and so th the the next phase will be we 'll actually be doing a larger proposal . and i 'm i i hope to be doing very little of it . and uh , which was also true for the pre - proposal , so . uh , there 'll be bunch of people working on it . so . grad b : when 's when 's the full proposal due ? professor a : uh , i think april ninth , or something . so it 's about a month . um grad b : yep . and they said end of business day you could check on the reviewer forms , is that phd g : tomorrow . professor a : tomorrow . march second , i said . phd e : tomorrow ? grad b : i 've been a day off all week . phd c : tomorrow . phd e : yeah . grad b : i guess that 's a good thing cuz that way i got my papers done early . phd g : it would be interesting professor a : so that 's amazing you showed up at this meeting ! grad b : it is . it is actually quite amazing . phd e : yeah . phd g : it 'll be interesting to see the reviewer 's comments . professor a : yeah . yeah . my favorite is was when when when one reviewer says , uh , `` you know , this should be far more detailed `` , and the nex the next reviewer says , `` you know , there 's way too much detail `` . grad b : yep . or `` this is way too general `` , and the other reviewer says , `` this is way too specific `` . phd c : yeah . professor a : yeah . phd c : yeah . professor a : yeah . grad b : `` this is way too hard `` , `` way too easy `` . professor a : we 'll see . maybe there 'll be something useful . and and , uh grad b : well it sounded like they they the first gate was pretty easy . is that right ? that they did n't reject a lot of the pre - proposals ? professor a : do you know anything about the numbers ? grad b : no . just just th phd g : it 's just from his message it sounded like that . phd e : yeah . yeah . i said something , yeah . phd g : gary strong 's there was a sentence at the end of one of his paragraphs phd e : yeah . phd g : i professor a : i should go back and look . i did n't i do n't think that 's true . grad b : yeah , ok . phd g : mmm . he said the next phase 'll be very , competitive phd e : very very , phd g : because we did n't want to weed out much in the first phase . phd e : yeah . yeah . professor a : well we 'll have to see what the numbers are . grad b : or something like that , phd c : mm - hmm . professor a : yeah . but they they have to weed out enough so that they have enough reviewers . grad b : right . phd c : yeah . professor a : so , uh , you know , maybe they did n't r weed out as much as usual , but it 's it 's usually a pretty but it yeah . it 's it 's certainly not i 'm sure that it 's not down to one in two or something of what 's left . grad b : right . professor a : i 'm sure it 's , you know grad b : how how many awards are there , do you know ? professor a : well there 's different numbers of w awards for different size they have three size grants . this one there 's , um see the small ones are less than five hundred thousand total over three years and that they have a fair number of them . um , and the large ones are , uh , boy , i forget , i think , more than , uh , more than a million and a half , more than two million or something like that . and and we 're in the middle middle category . grad b : mm - hmm . professor a : i think we 're , uh , uh , i forget what it was . but , um uh , i do n't remember , but it 's pr probably along the li i i could be wrong on this yeah , but probably along the lines of fifteen or that they 'll fund , or twenty . i mean when they do you do you know how many they funded when they f in in chuck 's , that he got last year ? phd g : i do n't i do n't know . professor a : yeah . grad b : i thought it was smaller , that it was like four or five , was n't it ? professor a : well they fund phd g : i i 'm professor a : they phd g : i do n't remember . professor a : yeah . i mean grad b : uh it does n't matter , we 'll find out one way or another . professor a : yeah . i mean last time i think they just had two categories , small and big , grad b : mm - hmm . professor a : and this time they came up with a middle one , so it 'll there 'll be more of them that they fund than of the big . phd g : if we end up getting this , um , what will it mean to icsi in terms of , w wh where will the money go to , what would we be doing with it ? grad b : exactly what we say in the proposal . phd g : i i mean uh which part is icsi though . professor a : you know , it i none of it will go for those yachts that we 've talking about . phd g : i mean dang ! professor a : um , well , no , i mean it 's u it phd g : it 's just for the research to continue the research on the meeting recorder stuff ? professor a : it 's extending the research , right ? because the other phd g : yeah . grad b : yeah it 's go higher level stuff than we 've been talking about for meeting recorder . professor a : yeah . yeah the other things that we have , uh , been working on with , uh , the c with communicator uh , especially with the newer things with the more acoustically - oriented things are are are are lower level . and , this is dealing with , uh , mapping on the level of of , um , the conversation of mapping the conversations phd g : mm - hmm . right , right . professor a : to different kind of planes . so . um . but , um . so it 's all it 's all stuff that none none of us are doing right now , or none of us are funded for , so it 's so it 's it would be new . phd g : so assuming everybody 's completely busy now , it means we 're gon na hafta , hire more students , or , something ? professor a : well there 's evenings , and there 's weekends , and uh . yeah , there there would be there would be new hires , and and there there would be expansion , but , also , there 's always for everybody there 's there 's always things that are dropping off , grants that are ending , or other things that are ending , so , phd g : right . professor a : there 's there 's a continual need to to bring in new things . phd c : mm - hmm . phd g : right . professor a : but but there definitely would be new new new , uh , students , phd g : i see . professor a : and so forth , both at at uw and here . grad b : are there any students in your class who are expressing interest ? professor a : um , not clear yet . not clear yet . grad b : other than the one who 's already here . professor a : i mean we got we have yeah , two of them are two in the c there 're two in the class already here , and then and and , uh uh , then there 's a third who 's doing a project here , who , uh but he he he wo n't be in the country that long , grad b : mm - hmm . professor a : and , maybe another will end up . actually there is one other guy who 's looking that that 's that guy , uh , jeremy ? { comment } i think . phd c : mm - hmm . professor a : anyway , yeah that 's that 's all i was gon na say is that that that 's you know , that 's nice and we 're sorta preceding to the next step , and , it 'll mean some more work , uh , you know , in in march in getting the proposal out , and then , it 's , uh , you know we 'll see what happens . uh , the last one was that you had there , { comment } was about naming ? grad b : yep . it just , uh we 've been cutting up sound files , in for ba both digits and for , uh , doing recognition . and liz had some suggestions on naming and it just brought up the whole issue that has n't really been resolved about naming . so , uh , one thing she would like to have is for all the names to be the same length so that sorting is easier . um , phd c : yeah . grad b : same number of characters so that when you 're sorting filenames you can easily extract out bits and pieces that you want . and that 's easy enough to do . and i do n't think we have so many meetings that that 's a big deal just to change the names . so that means , uh , instead of calling it `` mr one `` , `` mr two `` , you 'd call it `` mrm zero zero one `` , `` mrm zero zero two `` , things like that . just so that they 're they 're all the same length . postdoc f : but , you know , when you , do things like that you can always as long as you have uh , you can always search from the beginning or the end of the string . grad b : the problem is that they 're a lot of fields . postdoc f : you know , so `` zero zero two `` grad b : alright , postdoc f : yeah . grad b : so we we have th we 're gon na have the speaker id , the session , uh uh , information on the microphones , postdoc f : yeah , well , your example was really grad b : information on the speak on the channels and all that . phd c : uh - huh . grad b : and so if each one of those is a fixed length , the sorting becomes a lot easier . grad d : she wanted to keep them the same lengths across different meetings also . so like , the nsa meeting lengths , { comment } all filenames are gon na be the same length as the meeting recorder meeting names ? grad b : yep . and as i said , the it 's we just do n't have that many that that 's a big deal . phd g : cuz of digits . grad b : and so , uh , um , at some point we have to sort of take a few days off , let the transcribers have a few days off , make sure no one 's touching the data and reorganize the file structures . and when we do that we can also rationalize some of the naming . postdoc f : i i would think though that the transcribe the transcripts themselves would n't need to have such lengthy names . grad b : right . postdoc f : so , i mean , you 're dealing with a different domain there , and with start and end times and all that , and channels and stuff , grad b : right . so the only thing that would change with that is just the directory names , postdoc f : so , it 's a different set . grad b : i would change them to match . so instead of being mr one it would be mrm zero zero one . but i do n't think that 's a big deal . postdoc f : fine . fine . grad b : so for for m the meetings we were thinking about three letters and three numbers for meeting i ds . uh , for speakers , m or f and then three numbers , for , uh and , uh , that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling a speaker database so that we get those links back and forth and keep it consistent . um , and then , uh , the microphone issues . we want some way of specifying , more than looking in the `` key `` file , what channel and what mike . what channel , what mike , and what broadcaster . or i do n't know how to s say it . so i mean with this one it 's this particular headset with this particular transmitter w as a wireless . phd c : yeah . grad b : and you know that one is a different headset and different channel . and so we just need some naming conventions on that . phd c : yeah . grad b : and , uh , phd c : uh - huh . grad b : that 's gon na become especially important once we start changing the microphone set - up . we have some new microphones that i 'd like to start trying out , um , once i test them . and then we 'll we 'll need to specify that somewhere . so i was just gon na do a fixed list of , uh , microphones and types . phd c : yeah . grad b : so , as i said phd g : that sounds good . phd c : yeah . professor a : um , since we have such a short agenda list i guess i wi i will ask how how are the transcriptions going ? yeah . postdoc f : the the news is that i 've i uh s so in s um so i 've switched to start my new sentence . i i switched to doing the channel - by - channel transcriptions to provide , uh , the uh , tighter time bins for partly for use in thilo 's work and also it 's of relevance to other people in the project . and , um , i discovered in the process a couple of of interesting things , which , um , one of them is that , um , it seems that there are time lags involved in doing this , uh , uh , using an interface that has so much more complexity to it . and i and i wanted to maybe ask , uh , chuck to help me with some of the questions of efficiency . maybe i was thinking maybe the best way to do this in the long run may be to give them single channel parts and then piece them together later . and i i have a script , i can piece them together . i mean , so it 's like , i i know that i can take them apart and put them together and i 'll end up with the representation which is where the real power of that interface is . professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and it may be that it 's faster to transcribe a channel at a time with only one , uh , sound file and one , uh , set of of , uh , utterances to check through . phd c : yeah . professor a : i 'm a little confused . i thought that that one of the reason we thought we were so much faster than than , uh , the the other transcription , uh , thing was that that we were using the mixed file . postdoc f : oh , yes . ok . but , um , with the mixed , when you have an overlap , you only have a a choice of one start and end time for that entire overlap , which means that you 're not tightly , uh , tuning the individual parts th of that overlap by different speakers . professor a : mm - hmm . yeah . postdoc f : so someone may have only said two words in that entire big chunk of overlap . professor a : yeah . postdoc f : and for purposes of of , uh , things like well , so things like training the speech - nonspeech segmentation thing . phd e : yeah . postdoc f : th - it 's necessary to have it more tightly tuned than that . and w and w and , you know , is a it would be wonderful if , uh , it 's possible then to use that algorithm to more tightly tie in all the channels after that but , um , you know , i 've th the so , i i do n't know exactly where that 's going at this point . but m i was experimenting with doing this by hand and i really do think that it 's wise that we 've had them start the way we have with , uh , m y working off the mixed signal , um , having the interface that does n't require them to do the ti uh , the time bins for every single channel at a t uh , through the entire interaction . professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : um , i did discover a couple other things by doing this though , and one of them is that , um , um , once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by the transcriber . professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : as you might expect , professor a : sure . postdoc f : because when it 's a b backchannel could well happen in a very densely populated overlap . and if we 're gon na study types of overlaps , which is what i wan na do , an analysis of that , then that really does require listening { comment } to every single channel all the way through the entire { comment } length for all the different speakers . now , for only four speakers , that 's not gon na be too much time , but if it 's nine speakers , then that i that is more time . so it 's li you know , kind of wondering and i think again it 's like this it 's really valuable that thilo 's working on the speech - nonspeech segmentation because maybe , um , we can close in on that wi without having to actually go to the time that it would take to listen to every single channel from start to finish through every single meeting . phd e : yeah , but those backchannels will always be a problem i think . uh especially if they 're really short and they 're not very loud and so it it can it it will always happen that also the automatic s detection system will miss some of them , so . postdoc f : ok . well so then then , maybe the answer is to , uh , listen especially densely in places of overlap , phd e : yeah . postdoc f : just so that they 're they 're not being overlooked because of that , and count on accuracy during the sparser phases . phd e : yeah . postdoc f : cuz there are large s spaces of the that 's a good point . there are large spaces where there 's no overlap at all . someone 's giving a presentation , phd e : yeah . postdoc f : or whatever . that 's that 's a good that 's a good thought . and , um , let 's see , there was one other thing i was gon na say . i i think it 's really interesting data to work with , i have to say , it 's very enjoyable . i really , not not a problem spending time with these data . really interesting . and not just because i 'm in there . no , it 's real interesting . professor a : uh , well i think it 's a short meeting . uh , you 're you 're you 're still in the midst of what you 're doing from what you described last time , i assume , phd c : is true . professor a : and phd c : i have n't results , eh , yet professor a : yeah . phd c : but , eh , i i 'm continue working with the mixed signal now , { comment } after the the last experience . professor a : yeah . yeah . phd c : and and i 'm tried to to , uh , adjust the to to improve , eh , an harmonicity , eh , detector that , eh , i i implement . professor a : yeah . phd c : but i have problem because , eh , i get , eh , eh , very much harmonics now . professor a : yeah . phd c : um , harmonic possi possible harmonics , uh , eh , and now i 'm i 'm i 'm trying to to find , eh , some kind of a , um of h of help , eh , using the energy to to distinguish between possible harmonics , and and other fre frequency peaks , that , eh , corres not harmonics . and , eh , i have to to talk with y with you , with the group , eh , about the instantaneous frequency , because i have , eh , an algorithm , and , i get , mmm , eh , t t results similar results , like , eh , the paper , eh , that i i am following . but , eh , the the rules , eh , that , eh , people used in the paper to to distinguish the harmonics , is does n't work well . professor a : mm - hmm . phd c : and i i i i not sure that i eh , the the way o to ob the way to obtain the the instantaneous frequency is right , or it 's it 's not right . eh , professor a : yeah . phd c : i have n't enough file feeling to to to distinguish what happened . professor a : yeah , i 'd like to talk with you about it . if if if , uh if i do n't have enough time and y you wan na discuss with someone else some someone else besides us that you might want to talk to , uh , might be stephane . phd c : yeah . i talked with stephane and and thilo professor a : yeah and and thilo , yeah . yeah , but phd c : they nnn they they { comment } they did n't phd e : i 'm not too experienced with harmonics professor a : i see . phd c : they think that { comment } the experience is not enough to phd e : and phd g : is is this the algorithm where you hypothesize a fundamental , and then get the energy for all the harmonics of that fundamental ? phd c : no , no it 's no no . no . phd g : and then hypothesize a new fundamental and get the energy professor a : yeah , that 's wh phd c : no . i i i i do n't proth process the the fundamental . i i , ehm i calculate the the phase derivate using the fft . professor a : yeah . phd c : and the algorithm said that , eh , if you if you change the the the , eh , nnn the x - the frequency `` x `` , eh , using the in the instantaneous frequency , you can find , eh , how , eh , in several frequencies that proba probably the the harmonics , eh , professor a : uh - huh . phd c : the errors of peaks the frequency peaks , eh , eh , move around these , eh eh frequency harmonic the frequency of the harmonic . and , eh , if you if you compare the the instantaneous frequency , eh , of the of the , eh , continuous , eh , eh , filters , that , eh that , eh , they used eh , to to to get , eh , the the instantaneous frequency , professor a : mm - hmm . phd c : it probably too , you can find , eh , that the instantaneous frequency for the continuous , eh , eh the output of the continuous filters are very near . and in my case i in equal with our signal , it does n't happened . professor a : yeah . i 'd hafta look at that and think about it . phd c : and professor a : it 's it 's it 's i have n't worked with that either so i 'm not sure the way the simple - minded way i suggested was what chuck was just saying , is that you could make a a sieve . you know , y you actually say that here is phd c : yeah . professor a : let 's let 's hypothesize that it 's this frequency or that frequency , and and , uh , maybe you maybe you could use some other cute methods to , uh , short cut it by by uh , making some guesses , phd c : yeah . professor a : but but uh uh uh , i would , uh i mean you could make some guesses from , uh from the auto - correlation or something but but then , given those guesses , try , um , uh , only looking at the energy at multiples of the of that frequency , and and see how much of the take the one that 's maximum . call that the phd c : yeah . professor a : but phd c : using the energy of the of the multiple of the frequency . professor a : of all the harmonics of that . yeah . phd c : yeah . phd g : do you hafta do some kind of , uh , low - pass filter before you do that ? phd c : i do n't use . phd g : or phd c : but , i i know many people use , eh , low - pass filter to to to get , eh , the pitch . professor a : no . to get the pitch , yes . phd c : i do n't use . to get the pitch , yes . phd e : to get the pitch , yeah . phd c : but the harmonic , no . phd g : but i but the harmonics are gon na be , uh , uh , i do n't know what the right word is . um , they 're gon na be dampened by the uh , vocal tract , right ? the response of the vocal tract . professor a : yeah ? phd c : yeah ? phd g : and so just looking at the energy on those at the harmonics , is that gon na ? professor a : well so the thing is that the this is for , uh , a , um phd g : i m what you 'd like to do is get rid of the effect of the vocal tract . right ? phd e : yeah . phd g : and just look at the at at the signal coming out of the glottis . professor a : yeah . uh , well , yeah that 'd be good . phd c : yeah . professor a : but , uh but i but but i do n't know that you need to grad b : open wide ! professor a : but i do n't need you know if you need to get rid of it . i mean that 'd that 'd be nice but i do n't know if it 's ess if it 's essential . um , i mean cuz i think the main thing is that , uh , you 're trying phd g : uh - huh . professor a : wha what are you doing this for ? you 're trying distinguish between the case where there is , uh where where there are more than uh , where there 's more than one speaker and the case where there 's only one speaker . grad b : sorry . professor a : so if there 's more than one speaker , um yeah i guess you could i guess yeah you 're so you 're not distinguished between voiced and unvoiced , so so , i if you do n't if you do n't care about that phd c : yeah . professor a : see , if you also wan na just determine if you also wan na determine whether it 's unvoiced , then i think you want to look look at high frequencies also , because the f the fact that there 's more energy in the high frequencies is gon na be an ob sort of obvious cue that it 's unvoiced . phd g : yeah . professor a : but , i i uh i mean i i but , um , other than that i guess as far as the one person versus two persons , it would be primarily a low frequency phenomenon . and if you looked at the low frequencies , yes the higher frequencies are gon na there 's gon na be a spectral slope . the higher frequencies will be lower energy . but so what . i mean that 's that 's w phd c : i will prepare for the next week eh , all my results about the harmonicity and will will try to come in and to discuss here , because , eh , i have n't enough feeling to to u many time to to understand what happened with the with , eh , so many peaks , eh , eh , and i i see the harmonics there many time but , eh , there are a lot of peaks , eh , that , eh , they are not harmonics . professor a : yeah . phd c : um , i have to discover what what is the the w the best way to to { comment } to { comment } c to use them professor a : well , but yeah i do n't think you can i mean you 're not gon na be able to look at every frame , so i mean i i mean i i really i i really thought that the best way to do it , and i 'm speaking with no experience on this particular point , but , my impression was that the best way to do it was however you you 've used instantaneous frequency , whatever . { comment } however you 've come up you with your candidates , you wan na see how much of the energy is in that phd c : yeah . yeah . professor a : as coppo as opposed to all of the all the total energy . and , um , if it 's voiced , i guess so so y i think maybe you do need a voiced - unvoiced determination too . but if it 's voiced , phd c : yeah . professor a : um , and the , uh e the fraction of the energy that 's in the harmonic sequence that you 're looking at is relatively low , then it should be then it 's more likely to be an overlap . phd c : is height . yeah . this this is the idea the idea i i i had to to compare the the ratio of the the energy of the harmonics with the eh , with the , eh , total energy in the spectrum and try to get a ratio to to distinguish between overlapping and speech . mmm . professor a : but you 're looking a y you 're looking at let 's take a second with this . uh , uh , you 're looking at f at the phase derivative , um , in in , uh , what domain ? i mean this is this is in in in in bands ? or or phd c : no , no , no . professor a : just just overall phd c : it 's a it 's a o i w the band the band is , eh , from zero to to four kilohertz . and i i ot i professor a : and you just take the instantaneous frequency ? phd c : yeah . i u m t i i used two m two method two methods . eh , one , eh , based on the f eh , ftt . to fft to to obtain the or to study the harmonics from from the spectrum directly , professor a : yeah . phd c : and to study the energy and the multiples of professor a : yeah . phd c : frequency . and another another algorithm i have is the in the instantaneous frequency , based on on on the fft to to to calculate the the phase derivate in the time . eh , uh n the d i mean i i have two two algorithms . professor a : right . phd c : but , eh , in m i in my opinion the the the instantaneous frequency , the the the behavior , eh , was th it was very interesting . because i i saw eh , how the spectrum concentrate , eh , around the the harmonic . but then when i apply the the rule , eh , of the in the the instantaneous frequency of the ne of the continuous filter in the the near filter , the the rule that , eh , people propose in the paper does n't work . and i do n't know why . professor a : but the instantaneous frequency , would n't that give you something more like the central frequency of the you know , of the where most of the energy is ? i mean , i think if you does i does it why would it correspond to pitch ? phd c : yeah . i i i not sure . i i i try to to professor a : yeah . phd c : when first i i calculate , eh , using the fft , postdoc f : di - digital camera . phd c : the the grad b : keep forgetting . phd c : i get the the spectrum , professor a : yeah . phd c : and i represent all the frequency . professor a : yeah . phd c : and when ou i obtained the instantaneous frequency . and i change the the the @ @ , using the instantaneous frequency , here . professor a : oh , so you scale you s you do a a scaling along that axis according to instantaneous phd c : i use yeah . professor a : it 's a kinda normalization . phd c : yeah . yeah . because when when eh , when i i i use these these frequency , eh , the range is different , and the resolution is different . professor a : yeah . phd c : and i observe more more or less , thing like this . and the paper said that , eh , these frequencies are probably , eh , harmonics . professor a : i see . huh . phd c : but , eh , they used , eh , a rule , eh , based in the in the because to to calculate the instantaneous frequency , they use a hanning window . professor a : yeah . phd c : and , they said that , eh , if these peak are , eh , harmonics , the f instantaneous frequency , of the contiguous , eh w eh eh , filters are very near , or have to be very near . but , eh , phh ! i do n't i i i i don i i and i do n't know what is the what is the distance . and i tried to to put different distance , eh , to put difference , eh eh , length of the window , eh , different front sieve , pfff ! and i i not sure what happened . professor a : ok , yeah well i i guess i 'm not following it enough . i 'll { comment } probably gon na hafta look at the paper , but which i 'm not gon na have time to do in the next few days , but but i 'm i 'm curious about it . phd c : yeah . professor a : um , uh , ok . postdoc f : i i did i it did occur to me that this is uh , the return to the transcription , that there 's one third thing i wanted to to ex raise as a to as an issue which is , um , how to handle breaths . so , i wanted to raise the question of whether people in speech recognition want to know where the breaths are . and the reason i ask the question is , um , aside from the fact that they 're obviously very time - consuming to encode , uh , the fact that there was some i had the indication from dan ellis in the email that i sent to you , phd e : yeah . postdoc f : and you know about , that in principle we might be able to , um , handle breaths by accessi by using cross - talk from the other things , be able that in principle , maybe we could get rid of them , so maybe and i was i i do n't know , i mean we had this an and i did n't could n't get back to you , phd e : yeah . postdoc f : but the question of whether it 'd be possible to eliminate them from the audio signal , which would be the ideal situation , professor a : i do n't know think it 'd be ideal . postdoc f : cuz phd g : uh - uh . professor a : we - see , we 're we 're dealing with real speech and we 're trying to have it be as real as possible phd e : yeah . professor a : and breaths are part of real speech . postdoc f : well , except that these are really truly i mean , ther there 's a segment in o the one i did n the first one that i did for i for this , phd e : yeah . postdoc f : where truly w we 're hearing you breathing like as if we 're you 're in our ear , you know , and it 's like it 's like professor a : yeah . postdoc f : i y i i mean , breath is natural , but not professor a : it is but it is if you record it . phd c : yeah . postdoc f : except that we 're we 're trying to mimic oh , i see what you 're saying . you 're saying that the pda application would have uh , have to cope with breath . professor a : yeah . postdoc f : but phd g : an - any application may have to . grad b : the p d a might not have to , phd e : no i grad b : but more people than just pda users are interested in this corpus . phd e : yeah . grad b : so so mean you 're right postdoc f : ok , then the then i have two questions . grad b : we could remove it , postdoc f : yeah ? grad b : but i i think we do n't wan na w remove it from the corpus , in terms of delivering it because the people will want it in there . professor a : yeah . if it gets postdoc f : ok , so maybe the question is notating it . yeah ? professor a : yeah i right . if if it gets in the way of what somebody is doing with it then you might wan na have some method which will allow you to block it , but you it 's real data . you do n't wan na b but you do n't postdoc f : ok , well professor a : if s you know , if there 's a little bit of noise out there , and somebody is is talking about something they 're doing , that 's part of what we accept as part of a real meeting , even and we have the f uh the uh the the fan and the in the projector up there , and , uh , this is it 's this is actual stuff that we we wan na work with . postdoc f : well this is in very interesting because i it basically has a i it shows very clearly the contrast between , uh , speech recognition research and discourse research because in in discourse and linguistic research , what counts is what 's communit communicative . phd g : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and breath , you know , everyone breathes , they breathe all the time . and once in a while breath is communicative , but r very rarely . ok , so now , i had a discussion with chuck about the data structure professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and the idea is that the transcripts will that get stored as a master there 'll be a master transcript which has in it everything that 's needed for both of these uses . professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and the one that 's used for speech recognition will be processed via scripts . you know , like , don 's been writing scripts professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and and , uh , to process it for the speech recognition side . discourse side will have this this side over he the we we 'll have a s ch sorry , not being very fluent here . but , um , this the discourse side will have a script which will stri strip away the things which are non - communicative . ok . so then the then let 's let 's think about the practicalities of how we get to that master copy with reference to breaths . so what i would r r what i would wonder is would it be possible to encode those automatically ? could we get a breath detector ? grad b : oh , just to save the transcribers time . postdoc f : well , i mean , you just have no idea . i mean , if you 're getting a breath several times every minute , grad b : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and just simply the keystrokes it takes to negotiate , to put the boundaries in , to to type it in , i it 's just a huge amount of time . grad b : mm - hmm . phd e : oops . professor a : wh - what phd c : yeah . postdoc f : and you wan na be sure it 's used , and you wan na be sure it 's done as efficiently as possible , and if it can be done automatically , that would be ideal . professor a : what if you put it in but did n't put the boundaries ? postdoc f : well , but professor a : so you just know it 's between these other things , postdoc f : well , ok . so now there 's there 's another another possibility professor a : right ? postdoc f : which is , um , the time boundaries could mark off words { comment } from nonwords . and that would be extremely time - effective , if that 's sufficient . professor a : yeah i mean i 'm think if it 's too if it 's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se , we are gon na be building up models for these things and these things are somewhat self - aligning , so if so , we i i if we say there is some kind of a thing which we call a `` breath `` or a `` breath - in `` or `` breath - out `` , the models will learn that sort of thing . uh , so but you but you do want them to point them at some region where where the breaths really are . so postdoc f : ok . but that would maybe include a pause as well , phd g : well , there 's a there 's postdoc f : and that would n't be a problem to have it , uh , pause plus breath plus laugh plus sneeze ? professor a : yeah , i you know there is there 's this dynamic tension between between marking absolutely everything , as you know , and and and marking just a little bit and counting on the statistical methods . basically the more we can mark the better . but if there seems to be a lot of effort for a small amount of reward in some area , and this might be one like this although i i i 'd be interested to h get get input from liz and andreas on this to see if they cuz they 've - they 've got lots of experience with the breaths in in , uh , uh , their transcripts . grad b : they have lots of experience with breathing ? phd g : i professor a : actually well , yes they do , but we we can handle that without them here . but but but , uh , you were gon na say something about phd g : yeah , i i think , um , one possible way that we could handle it is that , um , you know , as the transcribers are going through , and if they get a hunk of speech that they 're gon na transcribe , u th they 're gon na transcribe it because there 's words in there or whatnot . if there 's a breath in there , they could transcribe that . phd e : yeah . yeah . postdoc f : that 's what they 've been doing . so , within an overlap segment , they they do this . phd g : right . but right . but if there 's a big hunk of speech , let 's say on morgan 's mike where he 's not talking at all , um , do n't do n't worry about that . phd e : yeah . phd g : so what we 're saying is , there 's no guarantee that , um so for the chunks that are transcribed , everything 's transcribed . but outside of those boundaries , there could have been stuff that was n't transcribed . so you just somebody ca n't rely on that data and say `` that 's perfectly clean data `` . uh do you see what i 'm saying ? postdoc f : yeah , you 're saying it 's uncharted territory . phd g : so i would say do n't tell them to transcribe anything that 's outside of a grouping of words . professor a : that sounds like a reasonable reasonable compromise . phd e : yeah , and that 's that that quite co corresponds to the way i i try to train the speech - nonspeech detector , as i really try to not to detect those breaths which are not within a speech chunk but with which are just in in a silence region . professor a : yeah . phd e : and they so they hopefully wo n't be marked in in those channel - specific files . professor a : u i i wanted to comment a little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes . phd e : but phd g : yeah , so postdoc f : mm - hmm . professor a : see , in a in a way this is a really key point , that for speech recognition , uh , research , uh , um , e a it 's not just a minor part . in fact , the i think i would say the core thing that we 're trying to do is to recognize the actual , meaningful components in the midst of other things that are not meaningful . so it 's critical it 's not just incidental it 's critical for us to get these other components that are not meaningful . because that 's what we 're trying to pull the other out of . that 's our problem . if we had nothing postdoc f : yeah . professor a : if we had only linguistically - relevant things if if we only had changes in the spectrum that were associated with words , with different spectral components , and , uh , we we did n't have noise , we did n't have convolutional errors , we did n't have extraneous , uh , behaviors , and so forth , and moving your head and all these sorts of things , then , actually speech recognition i i is n't that bad right now . i mean you can you know it 's it 's the technology 's come along pretty well . phd c : yeah . professor a : the the the reason we still complain about it is because is when when you have more realistic conditions then then things fall apart . postdoc f : ok , fair enough . i guess , um , i uh , what i was wondering is what what at what level does the breathing aspect enter into the problem ? because if it were likely that a pda would be able to be built which would get rid of the breathing , so it would n't even have to be processed at thi at this computational le well , let me see , it 'd have to be computationally processed to get rid of it , but if there were , uh , like likely on the frontier , a good breath extractor then , um , and then you 'd have to professor a : but that 's a research question , you know ? and so postdoc f : yeah , well , see and that 's what i would n't know . professor a : that and we do n't either . i mean so so the thing is it 's it right now it 's just raw d it 's just data that we 're collecting , and so we do n't wan na presuppose that people will be able to get rid of particular degradations because that 's actually the research that we 're trying to feed . so , you know , an and maybe maybe in five years it 'll work really well , and and it 'll only mess - up ten percent of the time , but then we would still want to account for that ten percent , so . postdoc f : i guess there 's another aspect which is that as we 've improved our microphone technique , we have a lot less breath in the in the more recent , uh , recordings , so it 's in a way it 's an artifact that there 's so much on the on the earlier ones . professor a : uh - huh . i see . phd g : one of the um , just to add to this one of the ways that we will be able to get rid of breath is by having models for them . i mean , that 's what a lot of people do nowadays . professor a : right . grad b : right . phd c : yeah . phd g : and so in order to build the model you need to have some amount of it marked , so that you know where the boundaries are . professor a : yeah . phd g : so i mean , i do n't think we need to worry a lot about breaths that are happening outside of a , you know , conversation . we do n't have to go and search for them to to mark them at all , but , i mean , if they 're there while they 're transcribing some hunk of words , i 'd say put them in if possible . postdoc f : ok , and it 's also the fact that they differ a lot from one channel to the other because of the way the microphone 's adjusted . phd c : yeah . phd g : mm - hmm . professor a : should we do the digits ? grad b : yep . ok .\n\n[Requirement] The translated text must be equal to 8192 words long.", "raw_data": "grad b : ok we 're on and we seem to be working . we did n't crash we 're not crashing anymore phd c : one , two , three , four , f grad b : and it really bothers me . professor a : yeah ? phd c : no crashing . phd g : i do . i crashed when i started this morning . grad b : you crashed crashed this morning ? i did not crash this morning . phd c : yeah ? professor a : oh ! well maybe it 's just , you know , how many t u u u u how many times you crash in a day . phd g : really ? yeah . maybe , yeah . professor a : first time first time in the day , you know . phd g : or maybe it 's once you 've done enough meetings { comment } it wo n't crash on you anymore . phd e : yeah . postdoc f : yeah . phd g : it 's a matter of experience . phd e : yeah . professor a : yeah . postdoc f : self - learning , yeah . professor a : that 's that 's great . phd g : yeah . phd c : yeah . professor a : do we have an agenda ? liz liz and andreas ca n't sh ca n't uh , ca n't come . grad b : i do . professor a : so , they wo n't be here . grad b : i have agenda and it 's all me . phd g : did grad b : cuz no one sent me anything else . phd g : did they send , uh , the messages to you about the meeting today ? grad b : i have no idea but i just got it a few minutes ago . right when you were in my office it arrived . phd g : oh . ok , cuz i checked my mail . i did n't have anything . grad b : so , does anyone have any a agenda items other than me ? i actually have one more also which is to talk about the digits . professor a : uh , right , so so i i was just gon na talk briefly about the nsf itr . phd c : mm - hmm . yeah . grad b : oh , great . professor a : uh , and then , you have i mean , i wo n't say much , but { comment } uh , but then , uh , you said wan na talk about digits ? grad b : i have a short thing about digits and then uh i wan na talk a little bit about naming conventions , although it 's unclear whether this is the right place to talk about it . so maybe just talk about it very briefly and take the details to the people who for whom it 's relevant . professor a : right . phd c : yeah . postdoc f : i could always say something about transcription . i 've been but but uh , well professor a : well if we yeah , we should n't add things in just to add things in . i 'm actually pretty busy today , postdoc f : yeah . professor a : so if we can { comment } we postdoc f : yeah , yeah , yeah . professor a : a short meeting would be fine . postdoc f : this does sound like we 're doing fine , yeah . that wo n't do . grad b : so the only thing i wan na say about digits is , we are pretty much done with the first test set . there are probably forms here and there that are marked as having been read that were n't really read . so i wo n't really know until i go through all the transcriber forms and extract out pieces that are in error . so i wa uh . two things . the first is what should we do about digits that were misread ? my opinion is , um , we should just throw them out completely , and have them read again by someone else . you know , the grouping is completely random , phd c : uh - huh . grad b : so it it 's perfectly fine to put a a group together again of errors and have them re - read , just to finish out the test set . postdoc f : oh ! by throw them out completely ? grad b : um , the other thing you could do is change the transcript to match what they really said . so those are those are the two options . phd c : yeah . postdoc f : mm - hmm . professor a : but there 's often things where people do false starts . i know i 've done it , where i say say a grad b : what the transcribers did with that is if they did a correction , and they eventually did read the right string , { comment } you extract the right string . phd g : oh , you 're talking about where they completely read the wrong string and did n't correct it ? phd e : yeah . grad b : yeah . and did n't notice . which happens in a few places . phd e : yeah . phd c : yeah . grad b : so so postdoc f : well , and s and you 're talking string - wise , you 're not talking about the entire page ? grad b : correct . phd e : yeah . postdoc f : i get it . grad b : and so the the two options are change the transcript to match what they really said , but then but then the transcript is n't the aurora test set anymore . i do n't think that really matters because the conditions are so different . and that would be a little easier . phd g : well how many are how how often does that happen ? grad b : mmm , five or six times . phd g : oh , so it 's not very much . grad b : no , it 's not much at all . phd g : seems like we should just change the transcripts phd e : yeah . phd g : to match . professor a : yeah , it 's five or six times out of thousands ? phd c : yeah . grad b : four thousand . professor a : four thousand ? phd c : four thous ah ! four thousand . phd g : yeah , it 's professor a : yeah , i would , uh , tak do the easy way , phd g : yeah . professor a : yeah . phd c : yeah . professor a : it it 's kinda nice i mean , wh who knows what studies people will be doing on on speaker - dependent things and so i think having having it all phd c : yeah . professor a : the speakers who we had is is at least interesting . phd g : so you um , how many digits have been transcribed now ? grad b : four thousand lines . and each line is between one and about ten digits . phd g : four thousand lines ? grad b : i did n't i did n't compute the average . i think the average was around four or five . professor a : so that 's a couple hours of of , uh , speech , probably . grad b : yep . yep . professor a : which is a yeah reasonable reasonable test set . phd c : mm - hmm . phd g : mm - hmm . grad b : and , jane , i do have a set of forms which i think you have copies of somewhere . postdoc f : mm - hmm . yeah , true . grad b : oh you do ? oh ok , good , good . postdoc f : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad b : yeah , i was just wond i thought i had had all of them back from you . and then the other thing is that , uh , the forms in front of us here that we 're gon na read later , were suggested by liz postdoc f : no , not yet . grad b : because she wanted to elicit some different prosodics from digits . and so , uh , i just wanted people to , take a quick look at the instructions phd c : mm - hmm . phd e : eight eight two two two nine . grad b : and the way it wa worked and see if it makes sense and if anyone has any comments on it . professor a : i see . and the decision here , uh , was to continue with uh the words rather than the the numerics . grad b : uh , yes , although we could switch it back . the problem was o and zero . although we could switch it back and tell them always to say `` zero `` or always to say `` o `` . postdoc f : oh professor a : or neither . phd c : yeah . professor a : but it 's just two thing ways that you can say it . grad b : mm - hmm . professor a : right ? grad b : sure . professor a : um um , phd e : yeah . professor a : that 's the only thought i have because if you t start talking about these , you know u tr she 's trying to get at natural groupings , but it there 's there 's nothing natural about reading numbers this way . grad b : right . professor a : i mean if you saw a telephone number you would never see it this way . grad b : the the problem also is she did want to stick with digits . i mean i 'm speaking for her since she 's not here . professor a : yeah . grad b : but , um , the other problem we were thinking about is if you just put the numerals , { comment } they might say forty - three instead of four three . phd e : yeah . phd c : yeah . phd e : yeah . phd c : yeah . postdoc f : well , if there 's space , though , between them . i mean , you can with when you space them out they do n't look like , uh , forty - three anymore . phd e : yeah . grad b : well , she and i were talking about it , professor a : yeah . grad b : and she felt that it 's very , very natural to do that sort of chunking . professor a : she 's right . it 's it it 's a different problem . i mean it 's a it 's a it 's an interesting problem i mean , we 've done stuff with numbers before , and yeah sometimes people if you say s `` three nine eight one `` sometimes people will say `` thirty - nine eighty - one `` or `` three hundred three hundred eighty - nine one `` , or i do n't think they 'd say that , phd c : yeah . professor a : but but th grad b : not very frequently professor a : no grad b : but , they certainly could . professor a : but yeah . uh , th thirty - eight ninety - one is probably how they 'd do it . grad b : so . i mean , this is something that liz and i spoke about professor a : but i see . grad b : and , since this was something that liz asked for specifically , i think we need to defer to her . professor a : mm - hmm . phd c : yeah . professor a : ok . well , we 're probably gon na be collecting meetings for a while and if we decide we still wan na do some digits later we might be able to do some different ver different versions , grad b : do something different , professor a : but this is the next suggestion , grad b : yeah . professor a : so . ok . ok , so uh e l i guess , let me , uh , get my my short thing out about the nsf . i sent this actually this is maybe a little side thing . um , i i sent to what i thought we had , uh , in some previous mail , as the right joint thing to send to , which was `` m mtg rcdr hyphen joint `` . grad b : it was . joint . yep . professor a : but then i got some sort of funny mail saying that the moderator was going to grad b : it 's that 's because they set the one up at uw that 's not on our side , that 's on the u - dub { comment } side . and so u - uw set it up as a moderated list . postdoc f : yeah . professor a : oh , ok . grad b : and , i have no idea whether it actually ever goes to anyone so you might just wan na mail to mari professor a : no no , th i got i got , uh , little excited notes from mari and jeff and so on , grad b : and professor a : so it 's grad b : ok , good . professor a : yeah . grad b : so the moderator actually did repost it . professor a : yeah . grad b : cuz i had sent one earlier actually the same thing happened to me i had sent one earlier . the message says , `` you 'll be informed `` and then i was never informed but i got replies from people indicating that they had gotten it , so . professor a : right . grad b : it 's just to prevent spam . professor a : i see . yeah so o ok . well , anyway , i guess everybody here are y are you are on that list , right ? so you got the note ? phd g : mm - hmm . professor a : yeah ? ok . phd g : yeah . professor a : um , so this was , uh , a , uh , proposal that we put in before on on more more higher level , uh , issues in meetings , from i guess higher level from my point of view . uh , and , uh , meeting mappings , and , uh so is i for it was a proposal for the itr program , uh , information technology research program 's part of national science foundation . it 's the second year of their doing , uh , these grants . they 're they 're a lot of them are some of them anyway , are larger larger grants than the usual , small nsf grants , and . so , they 're very competitive , and they have a first phase where you put in pre - proposals , and we we , uh , got through that . and so th the the next phase will be we 'll actually be doing a larger proposal . and i 'm i i hope to be doing very little of it . and uh , which was also true for the pre - proposal , so . uh , there 'll be bunch of people working on it . so . grad b : when 's when 's the full proposal due ? professor a : uh , i think april ninth , or something . so it 's about a month . um grad b : yep . and they said end of business day you could check on the reviewer forms , is that phd g : tomorrow . professor a : tomorrow . march second , i said . phd e : tomorrow ? grad b : i 've been a day off all week . phd c : tomorrow . phd e : yeah . grad b : i guess that 's a good thing cuz that way i got my papers done early . phd g : it would be interesting professor a : so that 's amazing you showed up at this meeting ! grad b : it is . it is actually quite amazing . phd e : yeah . phd g : it 'll be interesting to see the reviewer 's comments . professor a : yeah . yeah . my favorite is was when when when one reviewer says , uh , `` you know , this should be far more detailed `` , and the nex the next reviewer says , `` you know , there 's way too much detail `` . grad b : yep . or `` this is way too general `` , and the other reviewer says , `` this is way too specific `` . phd c : yeah . professor a : yeah . phd c : yeah . professor a : yeah . grad b : `` this is way too hard `` , `` way too easy `` . professor a : we 'll see . maybe there 'll be something useful . and and , uh grad b : well it sounded like they they the first gate was pretty easy . is that right ? that they did n't reject a lot of the pre - proposals ? professor a : do you know anything about the numbers ? grad b : no . just just th phd g : it 's just from his message it sounded like that . phd e : yeah . yeah . i said something , yeah . phd g : gary strong 's there was a sentence at the end of one of his paragraphs phd e : yeah . phd g : i professor a : i should go back and look . i did n't i do n't think that 's true . grad b : yeah , ok . phd g : mmm . he said the next phase 'll be very , competitive phd e : very very , phd g : because we did n't want to weed out much in the first phase . phd e : yeah . yeah . professor a : well we 'll have to see what the numbers are . grad b : or something like that , phd c : mm - hmm . professor a : yeah . but they they have to weed out enough so that they have enough reviewers . grad b : right . phd c : yeah . professor a : so , uh , you know , maybe they did n't r weed out as much as usual , but it 's it 's usually a pretty but it yeah . it 's it 's certainly not i 'm sure that it 's not down to one in two or something of what 's left . grad b : right . professor a : i 'm sure it 's , you know grad b : how how many awards are there , do you know ? professor a : well there 's different numbers of w awards for different size they have three size grants . this one there 's , um see the small ones are less than five hundred thousand total over three years and that they have a fair number of them . um , and the large ones are , uh , boy , i forget , i think , more than , uh , more than a million and a half , more than two million or something like that . and and we 're in the middle middle category . grad b : mm - hmm . professor a : i think we 're , uh , uh , i forget what it was . but , um uh , i do n't remember , but it 's pr probably along the li i i could be wrong on this yeah , but probably along the lines of fifteen or that they 'll fund , or twenty . i mean when they do you do you know how many they funded when they f in in chuck 's , that he got last year ? phd g : i do n't i do n't know . professor a : yeah . grad b : i thought it was smaller , that it was like four or five , was n't it ? professor a : well they fund phd g : i i 'm professor a : they phd g : i do n't remember . professor a : yeah . i mean grad b : uh it does n't matter , we 'll find out one way or another . professor a : yeah . i mean last time i think they just had two categories , small and big , grad b : mm - hmm . professor a : and this time they came up with a middle one , so it 'll there 'll be more of them that they fund than of the big . phd g : if we end up getting this , um , what will it mean to icsi in terms of , w wh where will the money go to , what would we be doing with it ? grad b : exactly what we say in the proposal . phd g : i i mean uh which part is icsi though . professor a : you know , it i none of it will go for those yachts that we 've talking about . phd g : i mean dang ! professor a : um , well , no , i mean it 's u it phd g : it 's just for the research to continue the research on the meeting recorder stuff ? professor a : it 's extending the research , right ? because the other phd g : yeah . grad b : yeah it 's go higher level stuff than we 've been talking about for meeting recorder . professor a : yeah . yeah the other things that we have , uh , been working on with , uh , the c with communicator uh , especially with the newer things with the more acoustically - oriented things are are are are lower level . and , this is dealing with , uh , mapping on the level of of , um , the conversation of mapping the conversations phd g : mm - hmm . right , right . professor a : to different kind of planes . so . um . but , um . so it 's all it 's all stuff that none none of us are doing right now , or none of us are funded for , so it 's so it 's it would be new . phd g : so assuming everybody 's completely busy now , it means we 're gon na hafta , hire more students , or , something ? professor a : well there 's evenings , and there 's weekends , and uh . yeah , there there would be there would be new hires , and and there there would be expansion , but , also , there 's always for everybody there 's there 's always things that are dropping off , grants that are ending , or other things that are ending , so , phd g : right . professor a : there 's there 's a continual need to to bring in new things . phd c : mm - hmm . phd g : right . professor a : but but there definitely would be new new new , uh , students , phd g : i see . professor a : and so forth , both at at uw and here . grad b : are there any students in your class who are expressing interest ? professor a : um , not clear yet . not clear yet . grad b : other than the one who 's already here . professor a : i mean we got we have yeah , two of them are two in the c there 're two in the class already here , and then and and , uh uh , then there 's a third who 's doing a project here , who , uh but he he he wo n't be in the country that long , grad b : mm - hmm . professor a : and , maybe another will end up . actually there is one other guy who 's looking that that 's that guy , uh , jeremy ? { comment } i think . phd c : mm - hmm . professor a : anyway , yeah that 's that 's all i was gon na say is that that that 's you know , that 's nice and we 're sorta preceding to the next step , and , it 'll mean some more work , uh , you know , in in march in getting the proposal out , and then , it 's , uh , you know we 'll see what happens . uh , the last one was that you had there , { comment } was about naming ? grad b : yep . it just , uh we 've been cutting up sound files , in for ba both digits and for , uh , doing recognition . and liz had some suggestions on naming and it just brought up the whole issue that has n't really been resolved about naming . so , uh , one thing she would like to have is for all the names to be the same length so that sorting is easier . um , phd c : yeah . grad b : same number of characters so that when you 're sorting filenames you can easily extract out bits and pieces that you want . and that 's easy enough to do . and i do n't think we have so many meetings that that 's a big deal just to change the names . so that means , uh , instead of calling it `` mr one `` , `` mr two `` , you 'd call it `` mrm zero zero one `` , `` mrm zero zero two `` , things like that . just so that they 're they 're all the same length . postdoc f : but , you know , when you , do things like that you can always as long as you have uh , you can always search from the beginning or the end of the string . grad b : the problem is that they 're a lot of fields . postdoc f : you know , so `` zero zero two `` grad b : alright , postdoc f : yeah . grad b : so we we have th we 're gon na have the speaker id , the session , uh uh , information on the microphones , postdoc f : yeah , well , your example was really grad b : information on the speak on the channels and all that . phd c : uh - huh . grad b : and so if each one of those is a fixed length , the sorting becomes a lot easier . grad d : she wanted to keep them the same lengths across different meetings also . so like , the nsa meeting lengths , { comment } all filenames are gon na be the same length as the meeting recorder meeting names ? grad b : yep . and as i said , the it 's we just do n't have that many that that 's a big deal . phd g : cuz of digits . grad b : and so , uh , um , at some point we have to sort of take a few days off , let the transcribers have a few days off , make sure no one 's touching the data and reorganize the file structures . and when we do that we can also rationalize some of the naming . postdoc f : i i would think though that the transcribe the transcripts themselves would n't need to have such lengthy names . grad b : right . postdoc f : so , i mean , you 're dealing with a different domain there , and with start and end times and all that , and channels and stuff , grad b : right . so the only thing that would change with that is just the directory names , postdoc f : so , it 's a different set . grad b : i would change them to match . so instead of being mr one it would be mrm zero zero one . but i do n't think that 's a big deal . postdoc f : fine . fine . grad b : so for for m the meetings we were thinking about three letters and three numbers for meeting i ds . uh , for speakers , m or f and then three numbers , for , uh and , uh , that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling a speaker database so that we get those links back and forth and keep it consistent . um , and then , uh , the microphone issues . we want some way of specifying , more than looking in the `` key `` file , what channel and what mike . what channel , what mike , and what broadcaster . or i do n't know how to s say it . so i mean with this one it 's this particular headset with this particular transmitter w as a wireless . phd c : yeah . grad b : and you know that one is a different headset and different channel . and so we just need some naming conventions on that . phd c : yeah . grad b : and , uh , phd c : uh - huh . grad b : that 's gon na become especially important once we start changing the microphone set - up . we have some new microphones that i 'd like to start trying out , um , once i test them . and then we 'll we 'll need to specify that somewhere . so i was just gon na do a fixed list of , uh , microphones and types . phd c : yeah . grad b : so , as i said phd g : that sounds good . phd c : yeah . professor a : um , since we have such a short agenda list i guess i wi i will ask how how are the transcriptions going ? yeah . postdoc f : the the news is that i 've i uh s so in s um so i 've switched to start my new sentence . i i switched to doing the channel - by - channel transcriptions to provide , uh , the uh , tighter time bins for partly for use in thilo 's work and also it 's of relevance to other people in the project . and , um , i discovered in the process a couple of of interesting things , which , um , one of them is that , um , it seems that there are time lags involved in doing this , uh , uh , using an interface that has so much more complexity to it . and i and i wanted to maybe ask , uh , chuck to help me with some of the questions of efficiency . maybe i was thinking maybe the best way to do this in the long run may be to give them single channel parts and then piece them together later . and i i have a script , i can piece them together . i mean , so it 's like , i i know that i can take them apart and put them together and i 'll end up with the representation which is where the real power of that interface is . professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and it may be that it 's faster to transcribe a channel at a time with only one , uh , sound file and one , uh , set of of , uh , utterances to check through . phd c : yeah . professor a : i 'm a little confused . i thought that that one of the reason we thought we were so much faster than than , uh , the the other transcription , uh , thing was that that we were using the mixed file . postdoc f : oh , yes . ok . but , um , with the mixed , when you have an overlap , you only have a a choice of one start and end time for that entire overlap , which means that you 're not tightly , uh , tuning the individual parts th of that overlap by different speakers . professor a : mm - hmm . yeah . postdoc f : so someone may have only said two words in that entire big chunk of overlap . professor a : yeah . postdoc f : and for purposes of of , uh , things like well , so things like training the speech - nonspeech segmentation thing . phd e : yeah . postdoc f : th - it 's necessary to have it more tightly tuned than that . and w and w and , you know , is a it would be wonderful if , uh , it 's possible then to use that algorithm to more tightly tie in all the channels after that but , um , you know , i 've th the so , i i do n't know exactly where that 's going at this point . but m i was experimenting with doing this by hand and i really do think that it 's wise that we 've had them start the way we have with , uh , m y working off the mixed signal , um , having the interface that does n't require them to do the ti uh , the time bins for every single channel at a t uh , through the entire interaction . professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : um , i did discover a couple other things by doing this though , and one of them is that , um , um , once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by the transcriber . professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : as you might expect , professor a : sure . postdoc f : because when it 's a b backchannel could well happen in a very densely populated overlap . and if we 're gon na study types of overlaps , which is what i wan na do , an analysis of that , then that really does require listening { comment } to every single channel all the way through the entire { comment } length for all the different speakers . now , for only four speakers , that 's not gon na be too much time , but if it 's nine speakers , then that i that is more time . so it 's li you know , kind of wondering and i think again it 's like this it 's really valuable that thilo 's working on the speech - nonspeech segmentation because maybe , um , we can close in on that wi without having to actually go to the time that it would take to listen to every single channel from start to finish through every single meeting . phd e : yeah , but those backchannels will always be a problem i think . uh especially if they 're really short and they 're not very loud and so it it can it it will always happen that also the automatic s detection system will miss some of them , so . postdoc f : ok . well so then then , maybe the answer is to , uh , listen especially densely in places of overlap , phd e : yeah . postdoc f : just so that they 're they 're not being overlooked because of that , and count on accuracy during the sparser phases . phd e : yeah . postdoc f : cuz there are large s spaces of the that 's a good point . there are large spaces where there 's no overlap at all . someone 's giving a presentation , phd e : yeah . postdoc f : or whatever . that 's that 's a good that 's a good thought . and , um , let 's see , there was one other thing i was gon na say . i i think it 's really interesting data to work with , i have to say , it 's very enjoyable . i really , not not a problem spending time with these data . really interesting . and not just because i 'm in there . no , it 's real interesting . professor a : uh , well i think it 's a short meeting . uh , you 're you 're you 're still in the midst of what you 're doing from what you described last time , i assume , phd c : is true . professor a : and phd c : i have n't results , eh , yet professor a : yeah . phd c : but , eh , i i 'm continue working with the mixed signal now , { comment } after the the last experience . professor a : yeah . yeah . phd c : and and i 'm tried to to , uh , adjust the to to improve , eh , an harmonicity , eh , detector that , eh , i i implement . professor a : yeah . phd c : but i have problem because , eh , i get , eh , eh , very much harmonics now . professor a : yeah . phd c : um , harmonic possi possible harmonics , uh , eh , and now i 'm i 'm i 'm trying to to find , eh , some kind of a , um of h of help , eh , using the energy to to distinguish between possible harmonics , and and other fre frequency peaks , that , eh , corres not harmonics . and , eh , i have to to talk with y with you , with the group , eh , about the instantaneous frequency , because i have , eh , an algorithm , and , i get , mmm , eh , t t results similar results , like , eh , the paper , eh , that i i am following . but , eh , the the rules , eh , that , eh , people used in the paper to to distinguish the harmonics , is does n't work well . professor a : mm - hmm . phd c : and i i i i not sure that i eh , the the way o to ob the way to obtain the the instantaneous frequency is right , or it 's it 's not right . eh , professor a : yeah . phd c : i have n't enough file feeling to to to distinguish what happened . professor a : yeah , i 'd like to talk with you about it . if if if , uh if i do n't have enough time and y you wan na discuss with someone else some someone else besides us that you might want to talk to , uh , might be stephane . phd c : yeah . i talked with stephane and and thilo professor a : yeah and and thilo , yeah . yeah , but phd c : they nnn they they { comment } they did n't phd e : i 'm not too experienced with harmonics professor a : i see . phd c : they think that { comment } the experience is not enough to phd e : and phd g : is is this the algorithm where you hypothesize a fundamental , and then get the energy for all the harmonics of that fundamental ? phd c : no , no it 's no no . no . phd g : and then hypothesize a new fundamental and get the energy professor a : yeah , that 's wh phd c : no . i i i i do n't proth process the the fundamental . i i , ehm i calculate the the phase derivate using the fft . professor a : yeah . phd c : and the algorithm said that , eh , if you if you change the the the , eh , nnn the x - the frequency `` x `` , eh , using the in the instantaneous frequency , you can find , eh , how , eh , in several frequencies that proba probably the the harmonics , eh , professor a : uh - huh . phd c : the errors of peaks the frequency peaks , eh , eh , move around these , eh eh frequency harmonic the frequency of the harmonic . and , eh , if you if you compare the the instantaneous frequency , eh , of the of the , eh , continuous , eh , eh , filters , that , eh that , eh , they used eh , to to to get , eh , the the instantaneous frequency , professor a : mm - hmm . phd c : it probably too , you can find , eh , that the instantaneous frequency for the continuous , eh , eh the output of the continuous filters are very near . and in my case i in equal with our signal , it does n't happened . professor a : yeah . i 'd hafta look at that and think about it . phd c : and professor a : it 's it 's it 's i have n't worked with that either so i 'm not sure the way the simple - minded way i suggested was what chuck was just saying , is that you could make a a sieve . you know , y you actually say that here is phd c : yeah . professor a : let 's let 's hypothesize that it 's this frequency or that frequency , and and , uh , maybe you maybe you could use some other cute methods to , uh , short cut it by by uh , making some guesses , phd c : yeah . professor a : but but uh uh uh , i would , uh i mean you could make some guesses from , uh from the auto - correlation or something but but then , given those guesses , try , um , uh , only looking at the energy at multiples of the of that frequency , and and see how much of the take the one that 's maximum . call that the phd c : yeah . professor a : but phd c : using the energy of the of the multiple of the frequency . professor a : of all the harmonics of that . yeah . phd c : yeah . phd g : do you hafta do some kind of , uh , low - pass filter before you do that ? phd c : i do n't use . phd g : or phd c : but , i i know many people use , eh , low - pass filter to to to get , eh , the pitch . professor a : no . to get the pitch , yes . phd c : i do n't use . to get the pitch , yes . phd e : to get the pitch , yeah . phd c : but the harmonic , no . phd g : but i but the harmonics are gon na be , uh , uh , i do n't know what the right word is . um , they 're gon na be dampened by the uh , vocal tract , right ? the response of the vocal tract . professor a : yeah ? phd c : yeah ? phd g : and so just looking at the energy on those at the harmonics , is that gon na ? professor a : well so the thing is that the this is for , uh , a , um phd g : i m what you 'd like to do is get rid of the effect of the vocal tract . right ? phd e : yeah . phd g : and just look at the at at the signal coming out of the glottis . professor a : yeah . uh , well , yeah that 'd be good . phd c : yeah . professor a : but , uh but i but but i do n't know that you need to grad b : open wide ! professor a : but i do n't need you know if you need to get rid of it . i mean that 'd that 'd be nice but i do n't know if it 's ess if it 's essential . um , i mean cuz i think the main thing is that , uh , you 're trying phd g : uh - huh . professor a : wha what are you doing this for ? you 're trying distinguish between the case where there is , uh where where there are more than uh , where there 's more than one speaker and the case where there 's only one speaker . grad b : sorry . professor a : so if there 's more than one speaker , um yeah i guess you could i guess yeah you 're so you 're not distinguished between voiced and unvoiced , so so , i if you do n't if you do n't care about that phd c : yeah . professor a : see , if you also wan na just determine if you also wan na determine whether it 's unvoiced , then i think you want to look look at high frequencies also , because the f the fact that there 's more energy in the high frequencies is gon na be an ob sort of obvious cue that it 's unvoiced . phd g : yeah . professor a : but , i i uh i mean i i but , um , other than that i guess as far as the one person versus two persons , it would be primarily a low frequency phenomenon . and if you looked at the low frequencies , yes the higher frequencies are gon na there 's gon na be a spectral slope . the higher frequencies will be lower energy . but so what . i mean that 's that 's w phd c : i will prepare for the next week eh , all my results about the harmonicity and will will try to come in and to discuss here , because , eh , i have n't enough feeling to to u many time to to understand what happened with the with , eh , so many peaks , eh , eh , and i i see the harmonics there many time but , eh , there are a lot of peaks , eh , that , eh , they are not harmonics . professor a : yeah . phd c : um , i have to discover what what is the the w the best way to to { comment } to { comment } c to use them professor a : well , but yeah i do n't think you can i mean you 're not gon na be able to look at every frame , so i mean i i mean i i really i i really thought that the best way to do it , and i 'm speaking with no experience on this particular point , but , my impression was that the best way to do it was however you you 've used instantaneous frequency , whatever . { comment } however you 've come up you with your candidates , you wan na see how much of the energy is in that phd c : yeah . yeah . professor a : as coppo as opposed to all of the all the total energy . and , um , if it 's voiced , i guess so so y i think maybe you do need a voiced - unvoiced determination too . but if it 's voiced , phd c : yeah . professor a : um , and the , uh e the fraction of the energy that 's in the harmonic sequence that you 're looking at is relatively low , then it should be then it 's more likely to be an overlap . phd c : is height . yeah . this this is the idea the idea i i i had to to compare the the ratio of the the energy of the harmonics with the eh , with the , eh , total energy in the spectrum and try to get a ratio to to distinguish between overlapping and speech . mmm . professor a : but you 're looking a y you 're looking at let 's take a second with this . uh , uh , you 're looking at f at the phase derivative , um , in in , uh , what domain ? i mean this is this is in in in in bands ? or or phd c : no , no , no . professor a : just just overall phd c : it 's a it 's a o i w the band the band is , eh , from zero to to four kilohertz . and i i ot i professor a : and you just take the instantaneous frequency ? phd c : yeah . i u m t i i used two m two method two methods . eh , one , eh , based on the f eh , ftt . to fft to to obtain the or to study the harmonics from from the spectrum directly , professor a : yeah . phd c : and to study the energy and the multiples of professor a : yeah . phd c : frequency . and another another algorithm i have is the in the instantaneous frequency , based on on on the fft to to to calculate the the phase derivate in the time . eh , uh n the d i mean i i have two two algorithms . professor a : right . phd c : but , eh , in m i in my opinion the the the instantaneous frequency , the the the behavior , eh , was th it was very interesting . because i i saw eh , how the spectrum concentrate , eh , around the the harmonic . but then when i apply the the rule , eh , of the in the the instantaneous frequency of the ne of the continuous filter in the the near filter , the the rule that , eh , people propose in the paper does n't work . and i do n't know why . professor a : but the instantaneous frequency , would n't that give you something more like the central frequency of the you know , of the where most of the energy is ? i mean , i think if you does i does it why would it correspond to pitch ? phd c : yeah . i i i not sure . i i i try to to professor a : yeah . phd c : when first i i calculate , eh , using the fft , postdoc f : di - digital camera . phd c : the the grad b : keep forgetting . phd c : i get the the spectrum , professor a : yeah . phd c : and i represent all the frequency . professor a : yeah . phd c : and when ou i obtained the instantaneous frequency . and i change the the the @ @ , using the instantaneous frequency , here . professor a : oh , so you scale you s you do a a scaling along that axis according to instantaneous phd c : i use yeah . professor a : it 's a kinda normalization . phd c : yeah . yeah . because when when eh , when i i i use these these frequency , eh , the range is different , and the resolution is different . professor a : yeah . phd c : and i observe more more or less , thing like this . and the paper said that , eh , these frequencies are probably , eh , harmonics . professor a : i see . huh . phd c : but , eh , they used , eh , a rule , eh , based in the in the because to to calculate the instantaneous frequency , they use a hanning window . professor a : yeah . phd c : and , they said that , eh , if these peak are , eh , harmonics , the f instantaneous frequency , of the contiguous , eh w eh eh , filters are very near , or have to be very near . but , eh , phh ! i do n't i i i i don i i and i do n't know what is the what is the distance . and i tried to to put different distance , eh , to put difference , eh eh , length of the window , eh , different front sieve , pfff ! and i i not sure what happened . professor a : ok , yeah well i i guess i 'm not following it enough . i 'll { comment } probably gon na hafta look at the paper , but which i 'm not gon na have time to do in the next few days , but but i 'm i 'm curious about it . phd c : yeah . professor a : um , uh , ok . postdoc f : i i did i it did occur to me that this is uh , the return to the transcription , that there 's one third thing i wanted to to ex raise as a to as an issue which is , um , how to handle breaths . so , i wanted to raise the question of whether people in speech recognition want to know where the breaths are . and the reason i ask the question is , um , aside from the fact that they 're obviously very time - consuming to encode , uh , the fact that there was some i had the indication from dan ellis in the email that i sent to you , phd e : yeah . postdoc f : and you know about , that in principle we might be able to , um , handle breaths by accessi by using cross - talk from the other things , be able that in principle , maybe we could get rid of them , so maybe and i was i i do n't know , i mean we had this an and i did n't could n't get back to you , phd e : yeah . postdoc f : but the question of whether it 'd be possible to eliminate them from the audio signal , which would be the ideal situation , professor a : i do n't know think it 'd be ideal . postdoc f : cuz phd g : uh - uh . professor a : we - see , we 're we 're dealing with real speech and we 're trying to have it be as real as possible phd e : yeah . professor a : and breaths are part of real speech . postdoc f : well , except that these are really truly i mean , ther there 's a segment in o the one i did n the first one that i did for i for this , phd e : yeah . postdoc f : where truly w we 're hearing you breathing like as if we 're you 're in our ear , you know , and it 's like it 's like professor a : yeah . postdoc f : i y i i mean , breath is natural , but not professor a : it is but it is if you record it . phd c : yeah . postdoc f : except that we 're we 're trying to mimic oh , i see what you 're saying . you 're saying that the pda application would have uh , have to cope with breath . professor a : yeah . postdoc f : but phd g : an - any application may have to . grad b : the p d a might not have to , phd e : no i grad b : but more people than just pda users are interested in this corpus . phd e : yeah . grad b : so so mean you 're right postdoc f : ok , then the then i have two questions . grad b : we could remove it , postdoc f : yeah ? grad b : but i i think we do n't wan na w remove it from the corpus , in terms of delivering it because the people will want it in there . professor a : yeah . if it gets postdoc f : ok , so maybe the question is notating it . yeah ? professor a : yeah i right . if if it gets in the way of what somebody is doing with it then you might wan na have some method which will allow you to block it , but you it 's real data . you do n't wan na b but you do n't postdoc f : ok , well professor a : if s you know , if there 's a little bit of noise out there , and somebody is is talking about something they 're doing , that 's part of what we accept as part of a real meeting , even and we have the f uh the uh the the fan and the in the projector up there , and , uh , this is it 's this is actual stuff that we we wan na work with . postdoc f : well this is in very interesting because i it basically has a i it shows very clearly the contrast between , uh , speech recognition research and discourse research because in in discourse and linguistic research , what counts is what 's communit communicative . phd g : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and breath , you know , everyone breathes , they breathe all the time . and once in a while breath is communicative , but r very rarely . ok , so now , i had a discussion with chuck about the data structure professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and the idea is that the transcripts will that get stored as a master there 'll be a master transcript which has in it everything that 's needed for both of these uses . professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and the one that 's used for speech recognition will be processed via scripts . you know , like , don 's been writing scripts professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and and , uh , to process it for the speech recognition side . discourse side will have this this side over he the we we 'll have a s ch sorry , not being very fluent here . but , um , this the discourse side will have a script which will stri strip away the things which are non - communicative . ok . so then the then let 's let 's think about the practicalities of how we get to that master copy with reference to breaths . so what i would r r what i would wonder is would it be possible to encode those automatically ? could we get a breath detector ? grad b : oh , just to save the transcribers time . postdoc f : well , i mean , you just have no idea . i mean , if you 're getting a breath several times every minute , grad b : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and just simply the keystrokes it takes to negotiate , to put the boundaries in , to to type it in , i it 's just a huge amount of time . grad b : mm - hmm . phd e : oops . professor a : wh - what phd c : yeah . postdoc f : and you wan na be sure it 's used , and you wan na be sure it 's done as efficiently as possible , and if it can be done automatically , that would be ideal . professor a : what if you put it in but did n't put the boundaries ? postdoc f : well , but professor a : so you just know it 's between these other things , postdoc f : well , ok . so now there 's there 's another another possibility professor a : right ? postdoc f : which is , um , the time boundaries could mark off words { comment } from nonwords . and that would be extremely time - effective , if that 's sufficient . professor a : yeah i mean i 'm think if it 's too if it 's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se , we are gon na be building up models for these things and these things are somewhat self - aligning , so if so , we i i if we say there is some kind of a thing which we call a `` breath `` or a `` breath - in `` or `` breath - out `` , the models will learn that sort of thing . uh , so but you but you do want them to point them at some region where where the breaths really are . so postdoc f : ok . but that would maybe include a pause as well , phd g : well , there 's a there 's postdoc f : and that would n't be a problem to have it , uh , pause plus breath plus laugh plus sneeze ? professor a : yeah , i you know there is there 's this dynamic tension between between marking absolutely everything , as you know , and and and marking just a little bit and counting on the statistical methods . basically the more we can mark the better . but if there seems to be a lot of effort for a small amount of reward in some area , and this might be one like this although i i i 'd be interested to h get get input from liz and andreas on this to see if they cuz they 've - they 've got lots of experience with the breaths in in , uh , uh , their transcripts . grad b : they have lots of experience with breathing ? phd g : i professor a : actually well , yes they do , but we we can handle that without them here . but but but , uh , you were gon na say something about phd g : yeah , i i think , um , one possible way that we could handle it is that , um , you know , as the transcribers are going through , and if they get a hunk of speech that they 're gon na transcribe , u th they 're gon na transcribe it because there 's words in there or whatnot . if there 's a breath in there , they could transcribe that . phd e : yeah . yeah . postdoc f : that 's what they 've been doing . so , within an overlap segment , they they do this . phd g : right . but right . but if there 's a big hunk of speech , let 's say on morgan 's mike where he 's not talking at all , um , do n't do n't worry about that . phd e : yeah . phd g : so what we 're saying is , there 's no guarantee that , um so for the chunks that are transcribed , everything 's transcribed . but outside of those boundaries , there could have been stuff that was n't transcribed . so you just somebody ca n't rely on that data and say `` that 's perfectly clean data `` . uh do you see what i 'm saying ? postdoc f : yeah , you 're saying it 's uncharted territory . phd g : so i would say do n't tell them to transcribe anything that 's outside of a grouping of words . professor a : that sounds like a reasonable reasonable compromise . phd e : yeah , and that 's that that quite co corresponds to the way i i try to train the speech - nonspeech detector , as i really try to not to detect those breaths which are not within a speech chunk but with which are just in in a silence region . professor a : yeah . phd e : and they so they hopefully wo n't be marked in in those channel - specific files . professor a : u i i wanted to comment a little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes . phd e : but phd g : yeah , so postdoc f : mm - hmm . professor a : see , in a in a way this is a really key point , that for speech recognition , uh , research , uh , um , e a it 's not just a minor part . in fact , the i think i would say the core thing that we 're trying to do is to recognize the actual , meaningful components in the midst of other things that are not meaningful . so it 's critical it 's not just incidental it 's critical for us to get these other components that are not meaningful . because that 's what we 're trying to pull the other out of . that 's our problem . if we had nothing postdoc f : yeah . professor a : if we had only linguistically - relevant things if if we only had changes in the spectrum that were associated with words , with different spectral components , and , uh , we we did n't have noise , we did n't have convolutional errors , we did n't have extraneous , uh , behaviors , and so forth , and moving your head and all these sorts of things , then , actually speech recognition i i is n't that bad right now . i mean you can you know it 's it 's the technology 's come along pretty well . phd c : yeah . professor a : the the the reason we still complain about it is because is when when you have more realistic conditions then then things fall apart . postdoc f : ok , fair enough . i guess , um , i uh , what i was wondering is what what at what level does the breathing aspect enter into the problem ? because if it were likely that a pda would be able to be built which would get rid of the breathing , so it would n't even have to be processed at thi at this computational le well , let me see , it 'd have to be computationally processed to get rid of it , but if there were , uh , like likely on the frontier , a good breath extractor then , um , and then you 'd have to professor a : but that 's a research question , you know ? and so postdoc f : yeah , well , see and that 's what i would n't know . professor a : that and we do n't either . i mean so so the thing is it 's it right now it 's just raw d it 's just data that we 're collecting , and so we do n't wan na presuppose that people will be able to get rid of particular degradations because that 's actually the research that we 're trying to feed . so , you know , an and maybe maybe in five years it 'll work really well , and and it 'll only mess - up ten percent of the time , but then we would still want to account for that ten percent , so . postdoc f : i guess there 's another aspect which is that as we 've improved our microphone technique , we have a lot less breath in the in the more recent , uh , recordings , so it 's in a way it 's an artifact that there 's so much on the on the earlier ones . professor a : uh - huh . i see . phd g : one of the um , just to add to this one of the ways that we will be able to get rid of breath is by having models for them . i mean , that 's what a lot of people do nowadays . professor a : right . grad b : right . phd c : yeah . phd g : and so in order to build the model you need to have some amount of it marked , so that you know where the boundaries are . professor a : yeah . phd g : so i mean , i do n't think we need to worry a lot about breaths that are happening outside of a , you know , conversation . we do n't have to go and search for them to to mark them at all , but , i mean , if they 're there while they 're transcribing some hunk of words , i 'd say put them in if possible . postdoc f : ok , and it 's also the fact that they differ a lot from one channel to the other because of the way the microphone 's adjusted . phd c : yeah . phd g : mm - hmm . professor a : should we do the digits ? grad b : yep . ok ."}

project manager : nah , i do n't think so really , marketing : yeah . project manager : because you have a i know some remote controls that do n't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten . industrial designer : yes , but but a lot uh marketing : yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television . or actually , the other way around . project manager : no , i think uh i really think it 's n marketing : but project manager : because you can when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it 's the same thing as when you just push the one , marketing : yeah . project manager : because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply . industrial designer : yes , but marketing : yeah , well but su if industrial designer : some televisions do n't accept uh that that project manager : yeah , because that 's i it 's for television . it 's exact the same thing . industrial designer : no , no , but s marketing : no no no . so some television respond differently . look , if uh i i project manager : no , listen listen . when you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . i in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . marketing : yes . yes , that 's true . project manager : the one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you do n't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . user interface : yeah . true . marketing : no project manager : i think it works that way , really . marketing : no , it it it works uh if you have n't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space . project manager : yeah , but it 's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button . industrial designer : yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons . project manager : yeah , but you do n't underst uh you do n't understand my point . marketing : yep . true . project manager : i think it 's exact the same thing when y industrial designer : you want yes , but some television do n't support it . project manager : no , but then they would a would also support that button , because it 's the same thing . user interface : but the ex project manager : listen , with that that 's that special but button you 're talking about , eh ? that 's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv tv that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . when you do n't have that separate button , and you push y one , it 's exactly the same thing . do y you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had marketing : no , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c industrial designer : a remote can project manager : yeah . but you give the input . industrial designer : so they need no , they need project manager : you push the one . that 's the same thing as the button with the one and it marketing : no , that 's not true . project manager : yes it it is . marketing : it 's simply not true . it 's simply not true . project manager : think about it . user interface : yeah . you uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something industrial designer : but uh marketing : uh project manager : and it 's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one . marketing : no , remote control does n't give signal after five seconds . remote control is a stupid thing . if you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television . project manager : yeah , that 's true . yeah , but i m uh but it 's i i know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that does n't sport these buttons , it still works . industrial designer : yeah , it project manager : but okay , we we 'll impl marketing : no , definitely not . definitely not . user interface : we 'll discuss them in the usability lab . project manager : no , we 'll apply them then for now . user interface : uh eva evaluation . marketing : user interface : i do n't know uh i do n't know if if it 's it 's necessary . project manager : yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . user interface : yeah ? project manager : yeah , i think so . yeah , for now , if we do n't know for sure whether user interface : okay . industrial designer : and the button for the scart uh audio video uh external input . project manager : yeah but marketing : uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , i guess . project manager : okay . what i said about uh the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : but i still think i it it all tvs in some ways support it , i do n't know . i think it 's more c is m maybe we do n't uh we both do n't really understand how it i how it really works , industrial designer : no , no . project manager : but i think there 's more to in than wha than what you just said . industrial designer : uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press . project manager : i do think that uh m tvs support mur multiple kind of remote controls . m industrial designer : uh , some n some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten project manager : th wo n't work wi with uh industrial designer : no , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . project manager : to have that special button . industrial designer : when you uh press one button , you give one signal . and the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher . but project manager : okay , well we 'll see . industrial designer : when you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals , it could work , but just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote . marketing : okay . i kinda miss the docking station . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yes . it 's here on the user interface : marketing : user interface : well it industrial designer : user interface : yeah , uh there 's nothing i think it 's pretty basic , industrial designer : we came uh user interface : the the there 's no fu there 's one there 's one button , marketing : no nothing really trendy about it . user interface : that 's wha there 's there 's there 's one function and that 's n the one button when you want to find it . industrial designer : but maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , marketing : the button . industrial designer : because real real reaction sells more products than only remote controls . so maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh m_p_ three players or or uh uh hearing devices . marketing : i think that 's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices . industrial designer : yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it 's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh marketing : yeah , of course . mm-hmm . well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape , of course . industrial designer : yes , but we can make marketing : the technology and the voltage can be the same . that 's uh that 's true . but uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit . industrial designer : no , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same . marketing : yeah , that 's true , but uh industrial designer : when when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . just have to be big enough for the biggest marketing : yes , but uh i i g should n't it fall then ? it is n't going to fall down ? that 's a bit uh industrial designer : no , when you make it large enough no it it will not . marketing : yeah , i think industrial designer : but then it 's a little bit marketing : no , but if if like this , i 'll i 'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this , industrial designer : but it 's just an idea . marketing : i wo n't draw it really . if you got a base which is uh as big as this industrial designer : but it 's flat it 's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this . user interface : you can . but i i i it 's backwards . marketing : yeah sure , but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can industrial designer : yes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big user interface : but it 's it 's backwards . it 's leaning . it 's leaning backwards , i think , in the in the docking station . marketing : yeah . uh , wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom user interface : that 's text . marketing : oh , right , help . project manager : but user interface : marketing : uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh in in the industrial designer : yes , little holer littler uh , little products go deeper in it . marketing : yeah . that i that is possible , yep . project manager : well let 's ha let 's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues still to come . marketing : yeah , sure , you 're right . industrial designer : yes . and uh uh project manager : but we have to look n i do n't know . industrial designer : the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . marketing : i do n't like the colours . mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button , which is the most common used uh function , and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so it 's it 's it 's really good design . marketing : yeah . alright . project manager : yes . that 's it ? industrial designer : yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it . marketing : the light . okay . and other lights ? project manager : i think added lights are gon na be a problem too . industrial designer : yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it . marketing : no , o on the on the front . yeah , okay . maybe the uh the logo . user interface : lights ? industrial designer : but , it will also uh uh use batteries , marketing : yeah , why not ? industrial designer : and do we want to marketing : of course . project manager : okay . for now , uh this is uh is good enough . yeah , what was uh on the marketing : okay . industrial designer : the all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh project manager : okay , but in the oh yeah , the colour , because we 're gon na use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , is n't it ? then we 're gon na do the buttons in the i are we 're gon na have rubber buttons . and they 're be a they 'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . user interface : yeah . marketing : uh , in the same colour as the side . user interface : yeah . yeah . yeah . marketing : yeah , i think i think that 'll be good . project manager : okay . and i think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic , and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff industrial designer : yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights , so it will uh project manager : yeah , we 'll talk about the lights later . 'cause i also don yeah , it 's depends on the costs and such . but uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours , marketing : yeah . project manager : but may i dunno if that 's important , but we 'll talk about that later . okay , for now this is this is okay . marketing : we will . project manager : um , the next p y you gon na give a presentation too ? uh , i have to see the agenda . marketing : well , uh yeah , i i 'm gon na do something right there , yeah . user interface : project manager : detail design . marketing : we got ta do that on the right the most right-most screen , because the leftmost project manager : evaluation criteria . marketing : yep , that 's me . project manager : okay . user interface : okay . marketing : alright . i will be needing that image , so leave it please . um go away . right , we 're gon na evaluate that design according to a few points . um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together . project manager : marketing : i wan na have a colour over here , come on . right , the remote is not ugly , a bit weird sentence , but the positive things has to be on the left , so i said not ugly instead of ugly . user interface : marketing : uh , what would you say , we we got ta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . user interface : project manager : okay . industrial designer : marketing : the remote control is not ugly . how do you feel ? project manager : yeah , i think four maybe would be appropriate , because it 's yeah , maybe it really depends on taste . uh , i mean it 's kind of , our design . it 's so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : background colour . project manager : i do n't know or uh i do n't know how you casting . yeah . industrial designer : i think i think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own marketing : how do you guys feel ? the different designs . industrial designer : yes , you can make it in your own uh user interface : yeah . industrial designer : more to your own personality or or house style . marketing : okay . project manager : yeah , but we d we did n't we 're we 're not planning to use fronts , i believe . marketing : no , not not fronts , but different designs . project manager : with a colour a co a colours . oh , okay . user interface : no , not fronts . different designs . different colours maybe , yeah . marketing : and that 's still uh uh , yeah , is is uh is a little personal touch , i guess . project manager : okay , but oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our marketing : what ? yeah , wha wha what would you uh guys uh think ? personally . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : or forty . user interface : we can make it a one . marketing : personally . yes , but what is it ? industrial designer : i think two or three . user interface : mm yeah . marketing : guido ? user interface : i agree . marketing : two or three . user interface : um , i uh i go for the positive . so i go for two . marketing : i was i was thinking about three , so i guess project manager : uh , i was thinking about four , so i think three is uh user interface : okay , three . marketing : three is uh a bit uh oh , what am i doing ? i 'll mark it . the remote control 's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah well , let that let 's make that a one . user interface : two . one . one . marketing : yeah ? antek , you agree ? user interface : okay yeah , i 'll i 'll agree . project manager : that 's one thing for sure . marketing : yeah . you 're not antek . user interface : i 'm the i 'm the usability , so marketing : i totally agree . the remote control the remote control 's relevant buttons are prominently visible . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , two or a one , i guess . user interface : the project manager : it 's something we really put work into . marketing : yeah , i yeah . industrial designer : it 's all about the buttons . marketing : i would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . and our oh yeah , it 's a b yeah . yeah ? alright . that 's a one ? you agree ? project manager : yeah . marketing : the remote control has n't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . i think we totally succeeded there . project manager : but user interface : well project manager : well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . marketing : oh user interface : yeah , well menu yeah , maybe . marketing : yeah , that 's true . that 's true . project manager : and telete industrial designer : also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits , project manager : yeah , we do n't know if the uh they 're necessary . industrial designer : o they 're used uh uh marketing : the the yeah , m well , you d you 've got a point . project manager : i think a two . user interface : yeah , true . yeah , i agree . industrial designer : can yes , three , two . project manager : came a long way , but not we did n't not uh marketing : two or three ? user interface : mm two . industrial designer : but you ca n't make a remote control without them , marketing : two ? antek . user interface : because we got industrial designer : because marketing : nay that that that 's true , that 's true . they 're definitely needed . project manager : no , w w it can also always be more simplistic , but two is marketing : so we put it on a two ? project manager : yeah . marketing : the remote control has got a really trendy look . user interface : industrial designer : yes . a one . project manager : yeah , uh a t i think a two . marketing : maarten . user interface : well . industrial designer : project manager : yeah yeah , y i it 's hard to say from this picture . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we we 've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever . user interface : yeah . marketing : ever , yeah . industrial designer : marketing : guido . project manager : but i do think it 's more user interface : uh , i will i will make it a three , because uh yeah . i i th project manager : but i do think that it 's more trendy than beautiful . marketing : yeah , uh i agree . i agree . project manager : so so i think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the user interface : yeah . true , yeah . marketing : i was planning to give it a two , uh where i give the not ugly uh project manager : a th a three . marketing : oh , yeah , that 's true . you agree on the two ? user interface : yeah . project manager : i i uh when you compare to the marketing : great . remote control has n't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . project manager : uh uh what 's the difference with user interface : marketing : uh , i copied that one . well , uh forget that . project manager : okay . marketing : um go away . remote control has got innovative technology implanted . user interface : no . we 're not well , maybe the the the on the side . industrial designer : no , not lcd , so . project manager : yeah , but we uh you mean the rubber stuff ? marketing : yeah , and the light . project manager : yeah , but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh . user interface : and the light maybe . industrial designer : but that that 's not innovative . user interface : but project manager : and i do n't u also it 's also really not innovative , industrial designer : lights lights are marketing : well , i g project manager : it 's more marketing : it 's not seven ? project manager : no , six . or seven maybe , yeah . user interface : well , six . no , six . project manager : or six . marketing : why uh why not a seven ? project manager : yeah , mine is seven . industrial designer : because we 've tried to make it a little bit innovative , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but it but it project manager : uh it 's uh depends on the on the maybe industrial designer : with the lights it it 's it 's kind of future user interface : project manager : no , i think i think actually it 's a seven maybe , but there 's nothing innovative about it . marketing : yeah , you think the lights are innovative ? well , it 's n true . uh , i agree , industrial designer : but still you can retrieve it when it 's when it 's gone , with the with marketing : m but user interface : innovative in generally or just f original for marketing : i 'll yeah , you you did n't draw the docking station . industrial designer : yes . the docking station is a is a little bit innovative . project manager : n no no , marketing : yeah , it it 's i think i think with its project manager : t . user interface : a docking station is innova project manager : yeah , i mean the dock station , but but uh , i think the the docking station , it 's gon na be a kind of a problem . user interface : industrial designer : it 's a part of the remote . marketing : i think more m user interface : okay . industrial designer : and with the speaker on the there 's also a speaker . project manager : but marketing : uh that that 's n project manager : well , let 's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . well i i yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : no uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so i think we project manager : okay , for now it 's a six or a seven uh , sev marketing : it 's it 's a six . project manager : six maybe , because industrial designer : but the retrieval or the marketing : that m f project manager : yeah , but i do n't i do n't know if it 's very inno yeah . marketing : yeah , for the retrieval function . yeah . i think that 's very innovative for a remote control . project manager : yeah , v industrial designer : yes , how would you innovate a remote control more ? project manager : yeah , more through uh like function tv functionalities and industrial designer : to put it on your head . project manager : no no , you know what i mean . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : you have must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control stuff , not in how you find your marketing : yeah sure , but project manager : yeah . yeah , it 's marketing : but i d i definitely do n't think it 's a five , project manager : that 's that 's think about it la later on marketing : but project manager : and uh marketing : remote control is easy to use . project manager : yeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least . industrial designer : yes . user interface : yeah , a two . marketing : i think a two . project manager : yeah , it 's good . marketing : yeah ? user interface : more two . marketing : come on . the remote control has n't got uh . project manager : no , i would have seen that one before . oh , you skipped one uh industrial designer : marketing : i 've just filled uh project manager : uh , here . marketing : go away . industrial designer : you like the buttons . marketing : i found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten . project manager : remote control will be bought by marketing : it will be bought by people under the age of forty . project manager : yeah . definitely . well industrial designer : in in and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ? marketing : no no no . no , just if they if they buy it . project manager : uh , just in general . yeah , a two . industrial designer : we do n't know . but project manager : yeah , but i think i think two . marketing : yeah , what do you think ? user interface : yeah , i think two , yeah . i agree . two . marketing : antek ? industrial designer : yes , two , but only in c when you compare it with with elderly . project manager : uh , that is not the question . it 's just w it will be bought by people under forty . marketing : no , that 's no comparison . project manager : yeah , you can yeah , you can be very picky about it . marketing : and i do n't mean two people . industrial designer : this is just guessing . project manager : ah yeah , just make it we 'll make it a two . industrial designer : make it a two . when it succeeds , uh it can get a two , mu marketing : right , the rem the remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan . project manager : oh no . yeah . yeah , you have make an user interface : we do n't have the slogan though . project manager : slogan is quite obvious . marketing : oh , the slogan . project manager : oh the oh sorry , no , not not the slogan . marketing : can we see the slogan ? project manager : yeah , you can put that on the side if if we would like to . user interface : the logo . industrial designer : a logo . user interface : underneath it or something . industrial designer : yes , uh encrypted uh with project manager : yeah , and i will i th still think it 's gon na be a two or a three . marketing : are we gon na do that ? user interface : a three . three . project manager : maybe a three this time . user interface : yeah , a three . marketing : three ? i agree . because of the slogan project manager : and uh marketing : remote control 's got a basic design intended uh for novice users . project manager : uh , it 's a one or a two . user interface : yeah , two . project manager : yeah , make it a two . marketing : two ? two . alright . we got ta add up the scores now to see our total average . four , five , seven , nine . forget that . fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six . twenty six . it 's a two point six . project manager : it 's not that bad . marketing : alright , we project manager : yeah , and that 's mostly the inno marketing : yeah . project manager : when we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , marketing : yeah . true . project manager : which is uh quite a great score . okay . uh , this is was uh the evaluation ? marketing : this was my evaluation . so project manager : because i i still think that the most important part of this meeting still has marketing : we did a pretty nice job until now . project manager : yeah . marketing : um , is this your industrial designer : is there something after this uh meeting ? or marketing : whatever . well , i think we got ta fill out another questionnaire . user interface : no . okay , yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : project manager : still opened or uh yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay , finance . because um user interface : shoot . project manager : i received uh a spreadsheet . marketing : a five . a five . project manager : yeah , but i uh actually do n't need this presentation , i guess . oh . marketing : does n't matter . project manager : i 'm gon na open the spreadsheet and we 're gon na work this out together , because i did n't really fin uh i have a . did n't really finish it . well , we uh we 'll see . we 'll stumble upon some problems . marketing : we probably will . project manager : i probably have already opened it here . try it again . first of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . but let 's let 's st start with beginning . we include one battery . i i uh i 'll explain its uh , the the components are listed over here . uh , price is given . we um yeah , marketing : the amount , yeah . project manager : we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . and then uh , we 'll uh calcula do n't watch the number yet . i do n't know if it 's filled in properly . okay , we need one battery . one battery . i think one battery is enough . we do n't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . a s okay , this this is a p first problem . uh , i think we should know how many simple chips , regular chips industrial designer : uh it 's it 's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it . project manager : okay . but industrial designer : the simple chip is e enough i i think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh marketing : i do n't know project manager : where did we find this information ? was it marketing : i have n't got an idea on on which we need to use , really . project manager : i think it was uh your job in the first uh meet uh , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems . industrial designer : no , uh i yes , my my my uh marketing : yeah . industrial designer : the the email i got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like i think the advanced chip maybe . marketing : yeah . and how do you know ? i mean , you got that email . did it point out what to use them for ? industrial designer : bec no , the they did n't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it . project manager : maybe you can uh look it up right now . okay , but okay . when we do n't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside , what industrial designer : then it 's a simple chip . project manager : then it would be a simple chip . and with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip . industrial designer : yes , i i i s i marketing : alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , i guess . project manager : okay . industrial designer : that will be enough for future uh recommendations . project manager : yeah , but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems . the sample sensor sample speaker . what is it m is that the speaker we were t i do n't know what it is . industrial designer : i do n't know it uh either . marketing : i do n't know . project manager : okay , we went for the double-curved case made out of plastic and rubber . and with a special colour . i guess that 's what we were user interface : well , special colour . . project manager : yeah , i do n't know about the special colour , but i think w uh industrial designer : otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour . user interface : i do n't marketing : i do n't know if it 's very special . project manager : yeah , i think we uh we have special colours . user interface : mm okay . industrial designer : standard rubber . marketing : alright , that 's okay . project manager : okay , then the push-button , i was just counting them . industrial designer : st project manager : uh , i think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , is n't it ? user interface : whoa , it 's a little project manager : well that 's bit of a problem , because i re but i really do n't understand that , because i can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it would n't be possible according to this uh sheet . user interface : that 's huge . no . we have the simplest buttons . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : no , it 's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . marketing : i do n't think so , because it says amount . industrial designer : if you use a scroll-wheel project manager : ah . yeah , it would n't marketing : the the the yellow row is the amount of project manager : fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost i do n't know . i industrial designer : maybe it 's the kind of push-buttons . you can have f four kind of push-buttons . user interface : uh , one til nine . industrial designer : rubber . user interface : is that one or is that nine buttons ? industrial designer : you can have uh project manager : and i count them like this . one two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . user interface : yeah . project manager : because oh , this is oh , this is one , okay . twelve , okay , then it would be eighteen , because uh , i uh rated them as uh um as uh uh uh separate buttons . industrial designer : different , marketing : that 's total of four buttons . project manager : and plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it 's will be uh eighteen . marketing : i think that eighteen . one two three four five , si industrial designer : why is that so uh expensive . project manager : yeah , i do n't understand . y i do i do n't get the point , because it 's would be s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons . user interface : is it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ? marketing : fifty cents for one single stupid button . user interface : no way . industrial designer : so , whe when you so then it project manager : well , okay , well well let 's make it just one . industrial designer : it 's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of project manager : here , now it 's now it 's already s marketing : yeah , exactly . yeah . project manager : shall we just give our own interpretation to , user interface : project manager : because else we would really have a problem . it would be impossible to make it marketing : i ca n't user interface : it 's way marketing : i i i could n't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . really . industrial designer : when you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . board . project manager : and and less buttons than this is n't possible . industrial designer : and then throw it marketing : yeah , yeah , industrial designer : project manager : this is the most simple user interface : no , no no . project manager : yeah , it is possible , but i 've never seen one before . industrial designer : but whe project manager : industrial designer : i 've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume , project manager : marketing : no , really . project manager : yeah , without the numbers . that 's possible . yeah , we could skip the numbers . user interface : yeah , uh industrial designer : but but marketing : yeah , but i d i would n't want to own that . really . user interface : that 's still four . industrial designer : uh , it 's it 's still for little children . they can handle that remote control , marketing : yeah . project manager : then uh , teletext would also be im impossible . industrial designer : but but it is n't fo yes , it 's for it 's li uh it 's just for a little user interface : yeah , that 's no option , that 's no option . project manager : okay , we 'll we 'll just okay . but then still , when we there 's no room for a docking station or something . tha w le let 's see th we have uh oh yeah , button supplements . we 'll give the buttons special colour . we 'll give them a special form . uh , i think we should mark the special form thing , because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , i guess . user interface : a special colour , why a special colour ? project manager : because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . user interface : but wha what s what special ? project manager : i think that 's the what they mean by a special colour . user interface : okay , yeah . industrial designer : otherwise , it user interface : uh , yeah . industrial designer : otherwise it would be the marketing : i do n't think the special form is really true . project manager : i think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that 's what we were planning to do , making it industrial designer : special form also , it says . project manager : yeah , special material r also , marketing : is it ? project manager : because i has rubber . and the buttons have to be rubber . industrial designer : what is the normal material ? user interface : plastic . marketing : yeah , i dunno . industrial designer : sh yeah . user interface : plastic , i think . industrial designer : classic ? user interface : plastic . industrial designer : oh , plastic . marketing : plastic . project manager : 'kay , but the problem now is that the there 's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station project manager : separately . user interface : se no no no . industrial designer : yes . and and but we do n't have to tell it , but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station . project manager : yeah , yeah . yeah , but i do like the idea , but we yeah . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : it uh but it then the docking station is n't relevant for this project anymore , but we can industrial designer : no , but you otherwise you ca n't retrieve it . project manager : but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we u need . marketing : yeah , i really do n't get it . i mean if it 's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two euros and thirty cents . project manager : i think we can agree on this . i i think the special colour thing has to be uh marked . 'cause i think we uh marketing : yeah , yep . project manager : yeah , i think that 's what what what they uh mean industrial designer : but for two euros and thirty cents , we uh we do n't get a docking station . marketing : i think so , too . oh , i do n't know . project manager : but can we find out uh about uh this chips ? because when we do n't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip . user interface : and then we can get a docking station . project manager : and maybe then we can do something extra . oh , n uh oh , still industrial designer : for project manager : oh , it 's gon na get more expensive with . two . user interface : project manager : then we have some money left . we can put then industrial designer : for two euros . project manager : we can put a scroll-wheel on it or something . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : uh why ? project manager : yeah , well who knows . or a little bit of tin titanium . marketing : i mean i i if you if it would cost two euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , i mean uh we 're not gon na add uh a trip to hawaii to it . user interface : but what what can we do project manager : yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . that 's also maybe an idea . user interface : but uh what can we do with the simple chip and what 's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ? project manager : yeah that 's what then what he has to find out . maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us . user interface : if if i project manager : maybe is that that 's nice to know . user interface : regular chip and because we do n't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example . project manager : yeah , bu bu but when we yeah , but when we skip when we um when we do n't use the do we 're not gon na make the docking station , then we still yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , marketing : i like the hand dynamo part . project manager : because that was our our special feature . marketing : we can make a plain docking station for two euros . user interface : yeah . we 'll go back uh tomorrow . marketing : i mean project manager : yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe marketing : wi wi without recharge project manager : it still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material . marketing : yeah , but but we can make a docking station for two euros uh if you do n't put the recharge function in it . i mean , it has a shape . project manager : yeah , but for two euros , then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip , marketing : of course it has a shape , but i i project manager : then two euros is n't even possible . marketing : why should that not be possible ? project manager : yeah , then because then we 'd thirty cents left . marketing : no , for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip . project manager : yeah , but yeah , i do n't know , because maybe d uh yeah , we have to find out with the simple chip . user interface : that 's the question . if we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f project manager : yeah , and w and and we uh need f industrial designer : it is n't in my information , so i do n't know it uh either . project manager : and what is this ? sample sensor sample speaker . industrial designer : it is n't in my information , i uh i i 've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or project manager : you can look at it for s presentation . s technical functions ? industrial designer : uh i 've got here in uh user interface : no no , they were uh mine , yeah . industrial designer : i will put a i will put a page on it . when my mouse works again . project manager : oh , oh oh . hey . oh . industrial designer : my mouse is uh marketing : dead . reanimate it . user interface : died . industrial designer : oh . ah , i 've got it . i will put uh my email on the the network . marketing : what the hell are these ? industrial designer : it 's on it . marketing : oh , whatever . user interface : yeah , it 's open . marketing : project manager : mm . i do n't think here it 's in here already . user interface : it 's circuit board . it 's only just basics for for project manager : it 's nothing about s yeah . user interface : at the end circuit there is an infrared led . marketing : this is n't helpful . project manager : no . but i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . which one was it ? user interface : components design . project manager : functional requirements ? industrial designer : um marketing : no , that was my presentation . user interface : components design maybe . n on top . industrial designer : yes , that was mine . project manager : ah . ah yes , it was the second one . industrial designer : but that was my second project manager : yeah , it was your second marketing : it 's already open . project manager : your first presentation . marketing : it 's at the bottom . project manager : sorry ? user interface : working design . marketing : it 's uh at your task bar . user interface : yeah , but it 's the the other one . industrial designer : mm project manager : uh , this is n this is not this n user interface : was it working design or components design ? marketing : sorry . project manager : that 's not the right one . i do n't oh . marketing : okay , sorry . project manager : no , this is the other one . or maybe something is uh maybe there 's something abo in in these user interface : chip set . industrial designer : but this is the same uh this is o only the possibilities . project manager : here . industrial designer : yeah . we can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip . marketing : yeah , nice . i it does n't say anything . user interface : the display requires an advanced chip . project manager : you know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires industrial designer : ah , okay . project manager : okay , so we only need a simple chip . user interface : requires . industrial designer : with the light . user interface : little lights . yeah , but that that 's just the same as the the led . project manager : no no , that 's just a simple chip . a scroll-wheel marketing : that 's not needed . project manager : it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . so , we do n't need any of them . marketing : a display uh is , of course , uh for showing letters . for showing text . industrial designer : lcd . user interface : yeah . marketing : i do n't think that uh just a l a little light user interface : no . i think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay . marketing : yeah , i agree . project manager : and what 's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ? industrial designer : maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , i guess so too . user interface : yeah , true . well , that 's not too what we want . marketing : next channel . no . well , we might want it , but user interface : project manager : okay . industrial designer : all in twelve euros . project manager : back to the costs . industrial designer : twelve euros and fifty cents . marketing : yeah . project manager : so we 're gon na use the simple chip . user interface : so , simple chip is okay . marketing : great . delete . industrial designer : and the lights . where uh are the lights ? marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , lights , yeah , there 's no marketing : well , there 're three , i guess . user interface : category . project manager : nah , there is some money left to be spent . user interface : can we do it wi within two two euro ? marketing : i think we can make a docking station . yeah . project manager : okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? but i mean it is n't it has n't got any innovative technology , we are n't gon na apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway , i think . i do n't i do n't see any possibility to do so , because it would would n't fit our defi design philosophy . user interface : mm-hmm . but it 's original . project manager : but what w is there some extra marketing : no , that 's true . project manager : maybe i think maybe the kinetic thing is something . instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to um know , so y so people would n't have to worry about their batteries anymore . maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it industrial designer : but but sometimes you put a project manager : yeah , you leave the p yeah , i know , but still i they will think about that . i mean if you u industrial designer : kinetics are n't uh nowadays only used in watches and that 's because you 're always walking . project manager : the uh it 's made for s people well , the they do n't if it was uh uh r useless technology , they would n't put it uh as a possibility . industrial designer : uh solar cells are useless . project manager : and i it it th th the the target marketing : or the hand dynamo dynamo project manager : the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : because i think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . because it 's one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot hey that maybe that 's cool that 's a cool thing about it , you know . you do n't use batteries . marketing : yeah , but but if we ca project manager : i 've never seen it before in a remote control . user interface : but then we could make a docking station . marketing : i do n't know if five minutes . project manager : no , we we we ca n't make a docking station anyway . marketing : that 's not true . project manager : yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one user interface : wow , w why no li marketing : we can make a docking station for two thirty . project manager : we can still make user interface : look at now , we got two industrial designer : fo for a docking station . marketing : two thirty . user interface : two thirty left . ca ca n't we make a docking station of that ? marketing : we can make a docking station . sure . industrial designer : with a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it . marketing : sure . user interface : i do n't know . marketing : the power device is is i i is very cheap . project manager : marketing : that 's just a regular uh power cable and whatever . project manager : yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control . industrial designer : wi with a button to user interface : well , we we uh industrial designer : wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . uh , so it 's uh wireless technology . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , but we uh we do n't inc we have n't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff . i do n't think it 's realistic for you to do so . marketing : well then it 's a useless project . industrial designer : look at the case , project manager : oh , because we industrial designer : the case the case of of uh of uh user interface : yeah , then we do n't have any innovation things . project manager : we well look at all the special stuff we have . colour a the colours are special , the form is special . it th this is whole concept . uh maybe it with the kinetic thing , i think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing . marketing : ca n't we uh ca n't we say fifteen euros ? project manager : uh , no . user interface : marketing : no , sta yeah i mean industrial designer : no , then we have to sell it for thirty euros . user interface : no , we only make less profit of it . industrial designer : it 's the marketing : you can sell for twenty seven and a half . then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs . user interface : no . project manager : yeah , i don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a uh uh i i i i still fee i also feel this concept of making it kinetic , because of the you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control . marketing : i do n't think industrial designer : maybe we can uh can do it both . maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . battery and kinetic . project manager : no , that would n't n no . marketing : thirteen twenty . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : yeah , and it is also not a good it 's not you have to really do it only kinetic , you do n't want it to think about batteries anymore . marketing : and i think only industrial designer : yes , but when it 's then when it marketing : yeah , but only kinetic , then you got ta project manager : no no . industrial designer : then you have to shake it uh and all when it 's when it 's empty . project manager : yeah , it 's great . marketing : you you got ta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really . industrial designer : project manager : no no no . no no , this is very sophisticated technology technology . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : when you use it your remote like once a day , or maybe even less i i it industrial designer : you asked for three d no , that 's n that 's not true . uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time . project manager : it we can make it yeah no . becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it industrial designer : yes , solar cells are also stated . project manager : yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells . industrial designer : why do n't we use solar cells then ? project manager : because i think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when i move my remote control around and industrial designer : that 's true . marketing : yeah , it 's funny for a week . i guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating . project manager : yeah , but you do n't have to . trust me . the idea of this technology is that you do n't think about it , it just happens . marketing : no , i i do n't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously . project manager : okay , then we d okay , well y we do n't have to do it , but what that would just have a lack of key features , you know . you m have to put something on your box . you have to make people buy it and uh we can really can do the docking thing , uh it 's not yeah , uh we can do it , but it 's would be a easy way out . industrial designer : you can do it for fifty cents . user interface : marketing : well , we 've got more than fifty cents . project manager : okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something , industrial designer : the c the case the case alone is is is uh project manager : because uh we only have a minute left or so . industrial designer : the case alone for uh remote control is at least one euro . then we have one euro thirty for the whole docking station . project manager : no no , it 's not possible . okay , w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th it 's this is then then our concept is ready . user interface : cheap remote control . project manager : yeah , we make some extra profit of it . marketing : yeah . no , we wo n't , but that 's um something else . user interface : it w it wo n't tell , but industrial designer : but now marketing : no , this not gon na sell . no . project manager : huh , any ideas ? marketing : of course not . user interface : no , uh , n no industrial designer : great . it 's great . user interface : yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . you have to do it over . industrial designer : our remote control . marketing : we come back tomorrow , okay ? project manager : no no uh there 's still there 's still someth concept and something special left . user interface : yeah . the industrial designer : seventy euros . project manager : i mean we 're gon na it 's gon na excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel . user interface : no , but no . project manager : that 's what it 's makes it special . yeah , and i would li i would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , and uh i know it will work , but uh it 's it 's an they 're they 're not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen . industrial designer : why not a hand dynamo then ? user interface : project manager : okay , well we leave it like this . then it 's c then we 're yeah . user interface : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : marketing : we ca n't do anything else . warning , finish meeting now . industrial designer : we 're done . project manager : okay , project e uh industrial designer : is this it ? project manager : well , we were gon na what look take a look at the last sheet . marketing : yeah , sure . industrial designer : okay . marketing : no , we ca n't . project manager : yeah , we have to yeah , it 's user interface : no . marketing : yes , yes . celebration . i do n't see why , but industrial designer : where 's the champagne ? marketing : i think we got ta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest . user interface : yeah ? industrial designer : i do n't uh hear a bell . marketing : no , not yet . industrial designer : user interface : we can do it here then . marketing : alright , i 'll see you guys in a minute . user interface : can we ca n't we do it here ? marketing : i do n't think so . i do n't know . i do n't i do n't think so . user interface : industrial designer : uh-huh . just fill that one in . user interface : yeah , we 're doing now . but it 's . oh , okay . project manager : uh , i do n't know .\n\n[Requirement] The translated text must be equal to 8192 words long.", "raw_data": "project manager : okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting . again , i 'm gon na take minutes . oh , we 're gon na have a prototype presentation first . uh , who 's gon na give the prototype presentation ? you two guys ? okay . go ahead . industrial designer : yes . user interface : . marketing : . user interface : coffee . marketing : industrial designer : 'kay , we 've made a prototype . um , we 've got uh uh our aspects from the last meeting . uh , especially we looked at the form , material and the colour . um , we 've uh drawn here the p prototype . the logo is uh is uh is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control , user interface : industrial designer : but it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher . um , our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing . maybe you can uh point them uh the functions . user interface : uh , well the uh all the functions are discussed uh i think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . uh , it 's a little bit . uh , power button . uh then the the the nine uh channels . project manager : user interface : uh the volume uh uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . and then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext project manager : oh no , the the the mute button misses now . user interface : i thought that was th marketing : alright , i project manager : do y do you user interface : oh , the mute button . project manager : did we want to have a m mute button ? industrial designer : but uh that marketing : yeah . industrial designer : it 's uh here then , in the middle . user interface : yeah . marketing : alright , and uh you got ta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button . industrial designer : yes , um user interface : well , yeah mo uh mo industrial designer : we 've disc user interface : yeah , well most of them are right-handed . industrial designer : most of the users marketing : yeah , but you you got ta make it clear on the on user interface : yeah well , i do n't have time in uh anymore on the industrial designer : yes , y there there will be a p a little a little p_ on that and a little uh yeah . marketing : yeah , and a and a triangle on that . user interface : oh yeah , just progr programme above , i think . marketing : yes . next to that i kinda miss a zero actually . user interface : project manager : wait , there 's was one thing i wanted to ask . marketing : industrial designer : user interface : marketing : industrial designer : project manager : uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like marketing : project manager : uh d i call it teens and twenties . uh , y th th th the two numbers . marketing : all n no , that 's um kinda dependent on the television . user interface : yeah , true , yeah . industrial designer : it 's a television . yes . project manager : yeah , but do we have do we need extra buttons , user interface : uh project manager : for example some uh some have to user interface : uh i think so . marketing : i think industrial designer : yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , uh th with the one and a double uh uh marketing : yeah , i think you should add user interface : zero ? marketing : a cross , or whatever . yeah , line . project manager : yeah , but you do n't you do n't actually need them , user interface : may maybe here ? project manager : becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds user interface : yeah . and then a second . marketing : no , that 's dependent on the television . project manager : no , i do n't think so . industrial designer : yes , you have televisions , then you have to , you know , you have to uh press marketing : i do know so . user interface : is it depending on television ? project manager : nah , i do n't think so really , marketing : yeah . project manager : because you have a i know some remote controls that do n't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten . industrial designer : yes , but but a lot uh marketing : yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television . or actually , the other way around . project manager : no , i think uh i really think it 's n marketing : but project manager : because you can when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it 's the same thing as when you just push the one , marketing : yeah . project manager : because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply . industrial designer : yes , but marketing : yeah , well but su if industrial designer : some televisions do n't accept uh that that project manager : yeah , because that 's i it 's for television . it 's exact the same thing . industrial designer : no , no , but s marketing : no no no . so some television respond differently . look , if uh i i project manager : no , listen listen . when you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . i in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . marketing : yes . yes , that 's true . project manager : the one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you do n't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . user interface : yeah . true . marketing : no project manager : i think it works that way , really . marketing : no , it it it works uh if you have n't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space . project manager : yeah , but it 's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button . industrial designer : yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons . project manager : yeah , but you do n't underst uh you do n't understand my point . marketing : yep . true . project manager : i think it 's exact the same thing when y industrial designer : you want yes , but some television do n't support it . project manager : no , but then they would a would also support that button , because it 's the same thing . user interface : but the ex project manager : listen , with that that 's that special but button you 're talking about , eh ? that 's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv tv that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . when you do n't have that separate button , and you push y one , it 's exactly the same thing . do y you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had marketing : no , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c industrial designer : a remote can project manager : yeah . but you give the input . industrial designer : so they need no , they need project manager : you push the one . that 's the same thing as the button with the one and it marketing : no , that 's not true . project manager : yes it it is . marketing : it 's simply not true . it 's simply not true . project manager : think about it . user interface : yeah . you uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something industrial designer : but uh marketing : uh project manager : and it 's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one . marketing : no , remote control does n't give signal after five seconds . remote control is a stupid thing . if you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television . project manager : yeah , that 's true . yeah , but i m uh but it 's i i know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that does n't sport these buttons , it still works . industrial designer : yeah , it project manager : but okay , we we 'll impl marketing : no , definitely not . definitely not . user interface : we 'll discuss them in the usability lab . project manager : no , we 'll apply them then for now . user interface : uh eva evaluation . marketing : user interface : i do n't know uh i do n't know if if it 's it 's necessary . project manager : yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . user interface : yeah ? project manager : yeah , i think so . yeah , for now , if we do n't know for sure whether user interface : okay . industrial designer : and the button for the scart uh audio video uh external input . project manager : yeah but marketing : uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , i guess . project manager : okay . what i said about uh the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : but i still think i it it all tvs in some ways support it , i do n't know . i think it 's more c is m maybe we do n't uh we both do n't really understand how it i how it really works , industrial designer : no , no . project manager : but i think there 's more to in than wha than what you just said . industrial designer : uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press . project manager : i do think that uh m tvs support mur multiple kind of remote controls . m industrial designer : uh , some n some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten project manager : th wo n't work wi with uh industrial designer : no , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . project manager : to have that special button . industrial designer : when you uh press one button , you give one signal . and the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher . but project manager : okay , well we 'll see . industrial designer : when you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals , it could work , but just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote . marketing : okay . i kinda miss the docking station . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yes . it 's here on the user interface : marketing : user interface : well it industrial designer : user interface : yeah , uh there 's nothing i think it 's pretty basic , industrial designer : we came uh user interface : the the there 's no fu there 's one there 's one button , marketing : no nothing really trendy about it . user interface : that 's wha there 's there 's there 's one function and that 's n the one button when you want to find it . industrial designer : but maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , marketing : the button . industrial designer : because real real reaction sells more products than only remote controls . so maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh m_p_ three players or or uh uh hearing devices . marketing : i think that 's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices . industrial designer : yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it 's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh marketing : yeah , of course . mm-hmm . well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape , of course . industrial designer : yes , but we can make marketing : the technology and the voltage can be the same . that 's uh that 's true . but uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit . industrial designer : no , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same . marketing : yeah , that 's true , but uh industrial designer : when when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . just have to be big enough for the biggest marketing : yes , but uh i i g should n't it fall then ? it is n't going to fall down ? that 's a bit uh industrial designer : no , when you make it large enough no it it will not . marketing : yeah , i think industrial designer : but then it 's a little bit marketing : no , but if if like this , i 'll i 'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this , industrial designer : but it 's just an idea . marketing : i wo n't draw it really . if you got a base which is uh as big as this industrial designer : but it 's flat it 's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this . user interface : you can . but i i i it 's backwards . marketing : yeah sure , but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can industrial designer : yes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big user interface : but it 's it 's backwards . it 's leaning . it 's leaning backwards , i think , in the in the docking station . marketing : yeah . uh , wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom user interface : that 's text . marketing : oh , right , help . project manager : but user interface : marketing : uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh in in the industrial designer : yes , little holer littler uh , little products go deeper in it . marketing : yeah . that i that is possible , yep . project manager : well let 's ha let 's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues still to come . marketing : yeah , sure , you 're right . industrial designer : yes . and uh uh project manager : but we have to look n i do n't know . industrial designer : the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . marketing : i do n't like the colours . mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button , which is the most common used uh function , and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so it 's it 's it 's really good design . marketing : yeah . alright . project manager : yes . that 's it ? industrial designer : yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it . marketing : the light . okay . and other lights ? project manager : i think added lights are gon na be a problem too . industrial designer : yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it . marketing : no , o on the on the front . yeah , okay . maybe the uh the logo . user interface : lights ? industrial designer : but , it will also uh uh use batteries , marketing : yeah , why not ? industrial designer : and do we want to marketing : of course . project manager : okay . for now , uh this is uh is good enough . yeah , what was uh on the marketing : okay . industrial designer : the all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh project manager : okay , but in the oh yeah , the colour , because we 're gon na use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , is n't it ? then we 're gon na do the buttons in the i are we 're gon na have rubber buttons . and they 're be a they 'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . user interface : yeah . marketing : uh , in the same colour as the side . user interface : yeah . yeah . yeah . marketing : yeah , i think i think that 'll be good . project manager : okay . and i think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic , and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff industrial designer : yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights , so it will uh project manager : yeah , we 'll talk about the lights later . 'cause i also don yeah , it 's depends on the costs and such . but uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours , marketing : yeah . project manager : but may i dunno if that 's important , but we 'll talk about that later . okay , for now this is this is okay . marketing : we will . project manager : um , the next p y you gon na give a presentation too ? uh , i have to see the agenda . marketing : well , uh yeah , i i 'm gon na do something right there , yeah . user interface : project manager : detail design . marketing : we got ta do that on the right the most right-most screen , because the leftmost project manager : evaluation criteria . marketing : yep , that 's me . project manager : okay . user interface : okay . marketing : alright . i will be needing that image , so leave it please . um go away . right , we 're gon na evaluate that design according to a few points . um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together . project manager : marketing : i wan na have a colour over here , come on . right , the remote is not ugly , a bit weird sentence , but the positive things has to be on the left , so i said not ugly instead of ugly . user interface : marketing : uh , what would you say , we we got ta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . user interface : project manager : okay . industrial designer : marketing : the remote control is not ugly . how do you feel ? project manager : yeah , i think four maybe would be appropriate , because it 's yeah , maybe it really depends on taste . uh , i mean it 's kind of , our design . it 's so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : background colour . project manager : i do n't know or uh i do n't know how you casting . yeah . industrial designer : i think i think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own marketing : how do you guys feel ? the different designs . industrial designer : yes , you can make it in your own uh user interface : yeah . industrial designer : more to your own personality or or house style . marketing : okay . project manager : yeah , but we d we did n't we 're we 're not planning to use fronts , i believe . marketing : no , not not fronts , but different designs . project manager : with a colour a co a colours . oh , okay . user interface : no , not fronts . different designs . different colours maybe , yeah . marketing : and that 's still uh uh , yeah , is is uh is a little personal touch , i guess . project manager : okay , but oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our marketing : what ? yeah , wha wha what would you uh guys uh think ? personally . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : or forty . user interface : we can make it a one . marketing : personally . yes , but what is it ? industrial designer : i think two or three . user interface : mm yeah . marketing : guido ? user interface : i agree . marketing : two or three . user interface : um , i uh i go for the positive . so i go for two . marketing : i was i was thinking about three , so i guess project manager : uh , i was thinking about four , so i think three is uh user interface : okay , three . marketing : three is uh a bit uh oh , what am i doing ? i 'll mark it . the remote control 's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah well , let that let 's make that a one . user interface : two . one . one . marketing : yeah ? antek , you agree ? user interface : okay yeah , i 'll i 'll agree . project manager : that 's one thing for sure . marketing : yeah . you 're not antek . user interface : i 'm the i 'm the usability , so marketing : i totally agree . the remote control the remote control 's relevant buttons are prominently visible . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , two or a one , i guess . user interface : the project manager : it 's something we really put work into . marketing : yeah , i yeah . industrial designer : it 's all about the buttons . marketing : i would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . and our oh yeah , it 's a b yeah . yeah ? alright . that 's a one ? you agree ? project manager : yeah . marketing : the remote control has n't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . i think we totally succeeded there . project manager : but user interface : well project manager : well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . marketing : oh user interface : yeah , well menu yeah , maybe . marketing : yeah , that 's true . that 's true . project manager : and telete industrial designer : also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits , project manager : yeah , we do n't know if the uh they 're necessary . industrial designer : o they 're used uh uh marketing : the the yeah , m well , you d you 've got a point . project manager : i think a two . user interface : yeah , true . yeah , i agree . industrial designer : can yes , three , two . project manager : came a long way , but not we did n't not uh marketing : two or three ? user interface : mm two . industrial designer : but you ca n't make a remote control without them , marketing : two ? antek . user interface : because we got industrial designer : because marketing : nay that that that 's true , that 's true . they 're definitely needed . project manager : no , w w it can also always be more simplistic , but two is marketing : so we put it on a two ? project manager : yeah . marketing : the remote control has got a really trendy look . user interface : industrial designer : yes . a one . project manager : yeah , uh a t i think a two . marketing : maarten . user interface : well . industrial designer : project manager : yeah yeah , y i it 's hard to say from this picture . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we we 've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever . user interface : yeah . marketing : ever , yeah . industrial designer : marketing : guido . project manager : but i do think it 's more user interface : uh , i will i will make it a three , because uh yeah . i i th project manager : but i do think that it 's more trendy than beautiful . marketing : yeah , uh i agree . i agree . project manager : so so i think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the user interface : yeah . true , yeah . marketing : i was planning to give it a two , uh where i give the not ugly uh project manager : a th a three . marketing : oh , yeah , that 's true . you agree on the two ? user interface : yeah . project manager : i i uh when you compare to the marketing : great . remote control has n't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . project manager : uh uh what 's the difference with user interface : marketing : uh , i copied that one . well , uh forget that . project manager : okay . marketing : um go away . remote control has got innovative technology implanted . user interface : no . we 're not well , maybe the the the on the side . industrial designer : no , not lcd , so . project manager : yeah , but we uh you mean the rubber stuff ? marketing : yeah , and the light . project manager : yeah , but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh . user interface : and the light maybe . industrial designer : but that that 's not innovative . user interface : but project manager : and i do n't u also it 's also really not innovative , industrial designer : lights lights are marketing : well , i g project manager : it 's more marketing : it 's not seven ? project manager : no , six . or seven maybe , yeah . user interface : well , six . no , six . project manager : or six . marketing : why uh why not a seven ? project manager : yeah , mine is seven . industrial designer : because we 've tried to make it a little bit innovative , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but it but it project manager : uh it 's uh depends on the on the maybe industrial designer : with the lights it it 's it 's kind of future user interface : project manager : no , i think i think actually it 's a seven maybe , but there 's nothing innovative about it . marketing : yeah , you think the lights are innovative ? well , it 's n true . uh , i agree , industrial designer : but still you can retrieve it when it 's when it 's gone , with the with marketing : m but user interface : innovative in generally or just f original for marketing : i 'll yeah , you you did n't draw the docking station . industrial designer : yes . the docking station is a is a little bit innovative . project manager : n no no , marketing : yeah , it it 's i think i think with its project manager : t . user interface : a docking station is innova project manager : yeah , i mean the dock station , but but uh , i think the the docking station , it 's gon na be a kind of a problem . user interface : industrial designer : it 's a part of the remote . marketing : i think more m user interface : okay . industrial designer : and with the speaker on the there 's also a speaker . project manager : but marketing : uh that that 's n project manager : well , let 's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . well i i yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : no uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so i think we project manager : okay , for now it 's a six or a seven uh , sev marketing : it 's it 's a six . project manager : six maybe , because industrial designer : but the retrieval or the marketing : that m f project manager : yeah , but i do n't i do n't know if it 's very inno yeah . marketing : yeah , for the retrieval function . yeah . i think that 's very innovative for a remote control . project manager : yeah , v industrial designer : yes , how would you innovate a remote control more ? project manager : yeah , more through uh like function tv functionalities and industrial designer : to put it on your head . project manager : no no , you know what i mean . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : you have must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control stuff , not in how you find your marketing : yeah sure , but project manager : yeah . yeah , it 's marketing : but i d i definitely do n't think it 's a five , project manager : that 's that 's think about it la later on marketing : but project manager : and uh marketing : remote control is easy to use . project manager : yeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least . industrial designer : yes . user interface : yeah , a two . marketing : i think a two . project manager : yeah , it 's good . marketing : yeah ? user interface : more two . marketing : come on . the remote control has n't got uh . project manager : no , i would have seen that one before . oh , you skipped one uh industrial designer : marketing : i 've just filled uh project manager : uh , here . marketing : go away . industrial designer : you like the buttons . marketing : i found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten . project manager : remote control will be bought by marketing : it will be bought by people under the age of forty . project manager : yeah . definitely . well industrial designer : in in and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ? marketing : no no no . no , just if they if they buy it . project manager : uh , just in general . yeah , a two . industrial designer : we do n't know . but project manager : yeah , but i think i think two . marketing : yeah , what do you think ? user interface : yeah , i think two , yeah . i agree . two . marketing : antek ? industrial designer : yes , two , but only in c when you compare it with with elderly . project manager : uh , that is not the question . it 's just w it will be bought by people under forty . marketing : no , that 's no comparison . project manager : yeah , you can yeah , you can be very picky about it . marketing : and i do n't mean two people . industrial designer : this is just guessing . project manager : ah yeah , just make it we 'll make it a two . industrial designer : make it a two . when it succeeds , uh it can get a two , mu marketing : right , the rem the remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan . project manager : oh no . yeah . yeah , you have make an user interface : we do n't have the slogan though . project manager : slogan is quite obvious . marketing : oh , the slogan . project manager : oh the oh sorry , no , not not the slogan . marketing : can we see the slogan ? project manager : yeah , you can put that on the side if if we would like to . user interface : the logo . industrial designer : a logo . user interface : underneath it or something . industrial designer : yes , uh encrypted uh with project manager : yeah , and i will i th still think it 's gon na be a two or a three . marketing : are we gon na do that ? user interface : a three . three . project manager : maybe a three this time . user interface : yeah , a three . marketing : three ? i agree . because of the slogan project manager : and uh marketing : remote control 's got a basic design intended uh for novice users . project manager : uh , it 's a one or a two . user interface : yeah , two . project manager : yeah , make it a two . marketing : two ? two . alright . we got ta add up the scores now to see our total average . four , five , seven , nine . forget that . fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six . twenty six . it 's a two point six . project manager : it 's not that bad . marketing : alright , we project manager : yeah , and that 's mostly the inno marketing : yeah . project manager : when we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , marketing : yeah . true . project manager : which is uh quite a great score . okay . uh , this is was uh the evaluation ? marketing : this was my evaluation . so project manager : because i i still think that the most important part of this meeting still has marketing : we did a pretty nice job until now . project manager : yeah . marketing : um , is this your industrial designer : is there something after this uh meeting ? or marketing : whatever . well , i think we got ta fill out another questionnaire . user interface : no . okay , yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : project manager : still opened or uh yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay , finance . because um user interface : shoot . project manager : i received uh a spreadsheet . marketing : a five . a five . project manager : yeah , but i uh actually do n't need this presentation , i guess . oh . marketing : does n't matter . project manager : i 'm gon na open the spreadsheet and we 're gon na work this out together , because i did n't really fin uh i have a . did n't really finish it . well , we uh we 'll see . we 'll stumble upon some problems . marketing : we probably will . project manager : i probably have already opened it here . try it again . first of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . but let 's let 's st start with beginning . we include one battery . i i uh i 'll explain its uh , the the components are listed over here . uh , price is given . we um yeah , marketing : the amount , yeah . project manager : we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . and then uh , we 'll uh calcula do n't watch the number yet . i do n't know if it 's filled in properly . okay , we need one battery . one battery . i think one battery is enough . we do n't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . a s okay , this this is a p first problem . uh , i think we should know how many simple chips , regular chips industrial designer : uh it 's it 's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it . project manager : okay . but industrial designer : the simple chip is e enough i i think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh marketing : i do n't know project manager : where did we find this information ? was it marketing : i have n't got an idea on on which we need to use , really . project manager : i think it was uh your job in the first uh meet uh , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems . industrial designer : no , uh i yes , my my my uh marketing : yeah . industrial designer : the the email i got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like i think the advanced chip maybe . marketing : yeah . and how do you know ? i mean , you got that email . did it point out what to use them for ? industrial designer : bec no , the they did n't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it . project manager : maybe you can uh look it up right now . okay , but okay . when we do n't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside , what industrial designer : then it 's a simple chip . project manager : then it would be a simple chip . and with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip . industrial designer : yes , i i i s i marketing : alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , i guess . project manager : okay . industrial designer : that will be enough for future uh recommendations . project manager : yeah , but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems . the sample sensor sample speaker . what is it m is that the speaker we were t i do n't know what it is . industrial designer : i do n't know it uh either . marketing : i do n't know . project manager : okay , we went for the double-curved case made out of plastic and rubber . and with a special colour . i guess that 's what we were user interface : well , special colour . . project manager : yeah , i do n't know about the special colour , but i think w uh industrial designer : otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour . user interface : i do n't marketing : i do n't know if it 's very special . project manager : yeah , i think we uh we have special colours . user interface : mm okay . industrial designer : standard rubber . marketing : alright , that 's okay . project manager : okay , then the push-button , i was just counting them . industrial designer : st project manager : uh , i think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , is n't it ? user interface : whoa , it 's a little project manager : well that 's bit of a problem , because i re but i really do n't understand that , because i can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it would n't be possible according to this uh sheet . user interface : that 's huge . no . we have the simplest buttons . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : no , it 's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . marketing : i do n't think so , because it says amount . industrial designer : if you use a scroll-wheel project manager : ah . yeah , it would n't marketing : the the the yellow row is the amount of project manager : fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost i do n't know . i industrial designer : maybe it 's the kind of push-buttons . you can have f four kind of push-buttons . user interface : uh , one til nine . industrial designer : rubber . user interface : is that one or is that nine buttons ? industrial designer : you can have uh project manager : and i count them like this . one two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . user interface : yeah . project manager : because oh , this is oh , this is one , okay . twelve , okay , then it would be eighteen , because uh , i uh rated them as uh um as uh uh uh separate buttons . industrial designer : different , marketing : that 's total of four buttons . project manager : and plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it 's will be uh eighteen . marketing : i think that eighteen . one two three four five , si industrial designer : why is that so uh expensive . project manager : yeah , i do n't understand . y i do i do n't get the point , because it 's would be s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons . user interface : is it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ? marketing : fifty cents for one single stupid button . user interface : no way . industrial designer : so , whe when you so then it project manager : well , okay , well well let 's make it just one . industrial designer : it 's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of project manager : here , now it 's now it 's already s marketing : yeah , exactly . yeah . project manager : shall we just give our own interpretation to , user interface : project manager : because else we would really have a problem . it would be impossible to make it marketing : i ca n't user interface : it 's way marketing : i i i could n't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . really . industrial designer : when you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . board . project manager : and and less buttons than this is n't possible . industrial designer : and then throw it marketing : yeah , yeah , industrial designer : project manager : this is the most simple user interface : no , no no . project manager : yeah , it is possible , but i 've never seen one before . industrial designer : but whe project manager : industrial designer : i 've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume , project manager : marketing : no , really . project manager : yeah , without the numbers . that 's possible . yeah , we could skip the numbers . user interface : yeah , uh industrial designer : but but marketing : yeah , but i d i would n't want to own that . really . user interface : that 's still four . industrial designer : uh , it 's it 's still for little children . they can handle that remote control , marketing : yeah . project manager : then uh , teletext would also be im impossible . industrial designer : but but it is n't fo yes , it 's for it 's li uh it 's just for a little user interface : yeah , that 's no option , that 's no option . project manager : okay , we 'll we 'll just okay . but then still , when we there 's no room for a docking station or something . tha w le let 's see th we have uh oh yeah , button supplements . we 'll give the buttons special colour . we 'll give them a special form . uh , i think we should mark the special form thing , because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , i guess . user interface : a special colour , why a special colour ? project manager : because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . user interface : but wha what s what special ? project manager : i think that 's the what they mean by a special colour . user interface : okay , yeah . industrial designer : otherwise , it user interface : uh , yeah . industrial designer : otherwise it would be the marketing : i do n't think the special form is really true . project manager : i think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that 's what we were planning to do , making it industrial designer : special form also , it says . project manager : yeah , special material r also , marketing : is it ? project manager : because i has rubber . and the buttons have to be rubber . industrial designer : what is the normal material ? user interface : plastic . marketing : yeah , i dunno . industrial designer : sh yeah . user interface : plastic , i think . industrial designer : classic ? user interface : plastic . industrial designer : oh , plastic . marketing : plastic . project manager : 'kay , but the problem now is that the there 's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station project manager : separately . user interface : se no no no . industrial designer : yes . and and but we do n't have to tell it , but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station . project manager : yeah , yeah . yeah , but i do like the idea , but we yeah . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : it uh but it then the docking station is n't relevant for this project anymore , but we can industrial designer : no , but you otherwise you ca n't retrieve it . project manager : but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we u need . marketing : yeah , i really do n't get it . i mean if it 's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two euros and thirty cents . project manager : i think we can agree on this . i i think the special colour thing has to be uh marked . 'cause i think we uh marketing : yeah , yep . project manager : yeah , i think that 's what what what they uh mean industrial designer : but for two euros and thirty cents , we uh we do n't get a docking station . marketing : i think so , too . oh , i do n't know . project manager : but can we find out uh about uh this chips ? because when we do n't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip . user interface : and then we can get a docking station . project manager : and maybe then we can do something extra . oh , n uh oh , still industrial designer : for project manager : oh , it 's gon na get more expensive with . two . user interface : project manager : then we have some money left . we can put then industrial designer : for two euros . project manager : we can put a scroll-wheel on it or something . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : uh why ? project manager : yeah , well who knows . or a little bit of tin titanium . marketing : i mean i i if you if it would cost two euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , i mean uh we 're not gon na add uh a trip to hawaii to it . user interface : but what what can we do project manager : yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . that 's also maybe an idea . user interface : but uh what can we do with the simple chip and what 's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ? project manager : yeah that 's what then what he has to find out . maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us . user interface : if if i project manager : maybe is that that 's nice to know . user interface : regular chip and because we do n't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example . project manager : yeah , bu bu but when we yeah , but when we skip when we um when we do n't use the do we 're not gon na make the docking station , then we still yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , marketing : i like the hand dynamo part . project manager : because that was our our special feature . marketing : we can make a plain docking station for two euros . user interface : yeah . we 'll go back uh tomorrow . marketing : i mean project manager : yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe marketing : wi wi without recharge project manager : it still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material . marketing : yeah , but but we can make a docking station for two euros uh if you do n't put the recharge function in it . i mean , it has a shape . project manager : yeah , but for two euros , then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip , marketing : of course it has a shape , but i i project manager : then two euros is n't even possible . marketing : why should that not be possible ? project manager : yeah , then because then we 'd thirty cents left . marketing : no , for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip . project manager : yeah , but yeah , i do n't know , because maybe d uh yeah , we have to find out with the simple chip . user interface : that 's the question . if we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f project manager : yeah , and w and and we uh need f industrial designer : it is n't in my information , so i do n't know it uh either . project manager : and what is this ? sample sensor sample speaker . industrial designer : it is n't in my information , i uh i i 've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or project manager : you can look at it for s presentation . s technical functions ? industrial designer : uh i 've got here in uh user interface : no no , they were uh mine , yeah . industrial designer : i will put a i will put a page on it . when my mouse works again . project manager : oh , oh oh . hey . oh . industrial designer : my mouse is uh marketing : dead . reanimate it . user interface : died . industrial designer : oh . ah , i 've got it . i will put uh my email on the the network . marketing : what the hell are these ? industrial designer : it 's on it . marketing : oh , whatever . user interface : yeah , it 's open . marketing : project manager : mm . i do n't think here it 's in here already . user interface : it 's circuit board . it 's only just basics for for project manager : it 's nothing about s yeah . user interface : at the end circuit there is an infrared led . marketing : this is n't helpful . project manager : no . but i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . which one was it ? user interface : components design . project manager : functional requirements ? industrial designer : um marketing : no , that was my presentation . user interface : components design maybe . n on top . industrial designer : yes , that was mine . project manager : ah . ah yes , it was the second one . industrial designer : but that was my second project manager : yeah , it was your second marketing : it 's already open . project manager : your first presentation . marketing : it 's at the bottom . project manager : sorry ? user interface : working design . marketing : it 's uh at your task bar . user interface : yeah , but it 's the the other one . industrial designer : mm project manager : uh , this is n this is not this n user interface : was it working design or components design ? marketing : sorry . project manager : that 's not the right one . i do n't oh . marketing : okay , sorry . project manager : no , this is the other one . or maybe something is uh maybe there 's something abo in in these user interface : chip set . industrial designer : but this is the same uh this is o only the possibilities . project manager : here . industrial designer : yeah . we can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip . marketing : yeah , nice . i it does n't say anything . user interface : the display requires an advanced chip . project manager : you know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires industrial designer : ah , okay . project manager : okay , so we only need a simple chip . user interface : requires . industrial designer : with the light . user interface : little lights . yeah , but that that 's just the same as the the led . project manager : no no , that 's just a simple chip . a scroll-wheel marketing : that 's not needed . project manager : it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . so , we do n't need any of them . marketing : a display uh is , of course , uh for showing letters . for showing text . industrial designer : lcd . user interface : yeah . marketing : i do n't think that uh just a l a little light user interface : no . i think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay . marketing : yeah , i agree . project manager : and what 's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ? industrial designer : maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , i guess so too . user interface : yeah , true . well , that 's not too what we want . marketing : next channel . no . well , we might want it , but user interface : project manager : okay . industrial designer : all in twelve euros . project manager : back to the costs . industrial designer : twelve euros and fifty cents . marketing : yeah . project manager : so we 're gon na use the simple chip . user interface : so , simple chip is okay . marketing : great . delete . industrial designer : and the lights . where uh are the lights ? marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , lights , yeah , there 's no marketing : well , there 're three , i guess . user interface : category . project manager : nah , there is some money left to be spent . user interface : can we do it wi within two two euro ? marketing : i think we can make a docking station . yeah . project manager : okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? but i mean it is n't it has n't got any innovative technology , we are n't gon na apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway , i think . i do n't i do n't see any possibility to do so , because it would would n't fit our defi design philosophy . user interface : mm-hmm . but it 's original . project manager : but what w is there some extra marketing : no , that 's true . project manager : maybe i think maybe the kinetic thing is something . instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to um know , so y so people would n't have to worry about their batteries anymore . maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it industrial designer : but but sometimes you put a project manager : yeah , you leave the p yeah , i know , but still i they will think about that . i mean if you u industrial designer : kinetics are n't uh nowadays only used in watches and that 's because you 're always walking . project manager : the uh it 's made for s people well , the they do n't if it was uh uh r useless technology , they would n't put it uh as a possibility . industrial designer : uh solar cells are useless . project manager : and i it it th th the the target marketing : or the hand dynamo dynamo project manager : the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : because i think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . because it 's one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot hey that maybe that 's cool that 's a cool thing about it , you know . you do n't use batteries . marketing : yeah , but but if we ca project manager : i 've never seen it before in a remote control . user interface : but then we could make a docking station . marketing : i do n't know if five minutes . project manager : no , we we we ca n't make a docking station anyway . marketing : that 's not true . project manager : yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one user interface : wow , w why no li marketing : we can make a docking station for two thirty . project manager : we can still make user interface : look at now , we got two industrial designer : fo for a docking station . marketing : two thirty . user interface : two thirty left . ca ca n't we make a docking station of that ? marketing : we can make a docking station . sure . industrial designer : with a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it . marketing : sure . user interface : i do n't know . marketing : the power device is is i i is very cheap . project manager : marketing : that 's just a regular uh power cable and whatever . project manager : yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control . industrial designer : wi with a button to user interface : well , we we uh industrial designer : wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . uh , so it 's uh wireless technology . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , but we uh we do n't inc we have n't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff . i do n't think it 's realistic for you to do so . marketing : well then it 's a useless project . industrial designer : look at the case , project manager : oh , because we industrial designer : the case the case of of uh of uh user interface : yeah , then we do n't have any innovation things . project manager : we well look at all the special stuff we have . colour a the colours are special , the form is special . it th this is whole concept . uh maybe it with the kinetic thing , i think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing . marketing : ca n't we uh ca n't we say fifteen euros ? project manager : uh , no . user interface : marketing : no , sta yeah i mean industrial designer : no , then we have to sell it for thirty euros . user interface : no , we only make less profit of it . industrial designer : it 's the marketing : you can sell for twenty seven and a half . then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs . user interface : no . project manager : yeah , i don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a uh uh i i i i still fee i also feel this concept of making it kinetic , because of the you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control . marketing : i do n't think industrial designer : maybe we can uh can do it both . maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . battery and kinetic . project manager : no , that would n't n no . marketing : thirteen twenty . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : yeah , and it is also not a good it 's not you have to really do it only kinetic , you do n't want it to think about batteries anymore . marketing : and i think only industrial designer : yes , but when it 's then when it marketing : yeah , but only kinetic , then you got ta project manager : no no . industrial designer : then you have to shake it uh and all when it 's when it 's empty . project manager : yeah , it 's great . marketing : you you got ta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really . industrial designer : project manager : no no no . no no , this is very sophisticated technology technology . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : when you use it your remote like once a day , or maybe even less i i it industrial designer : you asked for three d no , that 's n that 's not true . uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time . project manager : it we can make it yeah no . becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it industrial designer : yes , solar cells are also stated . project manager : yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells . industrial designer : why do n't we use solar cells then ? project manager : because i think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when i move my remote control around and industrial designer : that 's true . marketing : yeah , it 's funny for a week . i guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating . project manager : yeah , but you do n't have to . trust me . the idea of this technology is that you do n't think about it , it just happens . marketing : no , i i do n't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously . project manager : okay , then we d okay , well y we do n't have to do it , but what that would just have a lack of key features , you know . you m have to put something on your box . you have to make people buy it and uh we can really can do the docking thing , uh it 's not yeah , uh we can do it , but it 's would be a easy way out . industrial designer : you can do it for fifty cents . user interface : marketing : well , we 've got more than fifty cents . project manager : okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something , industrial designer : the c the case the case alone is is is uh project manager : because uh we only have a minute left or so . industrial designer : the case alone for uh remote control is at least one euro . then we have one euro thirty for the whole docking station . project manager : no no , it 's not possible . okay , w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th it 's this is then then our concept is ready . user interface : cheap remote control . project manager : yeah , we make some extra profit of it . marketing : yeah . no , we wo n't , but that 's um something else . user interface : it w it wo n't tell , but industrial designer : but now marketing : no , this not gon na sell . no . project manager : huh , any ideas ? marketing : of course not . user interface : no , uh , n no industrial designer : great . it 's great . user interface : yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . you have to do it over . industrial designer : our remote control . marketing : we come back tomorrow , okay ? project manager : no no uh there 's still there 's still someth concept and something special left . user interface : yeah . the industrial designer : seventy euros . project manager : i mean we 're gon na it 's gon na excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel . user interface : no , but no . project manager : that 's what it 's makes it special . yeah , and i would li i would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , and uh i know it will work , but uh it 's it 's an they 're they 're not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen . industrial designer : why not a hand dynamo then ? user interface : project manager : okay , well we leave it like this . then it 's c then we 're yeah . user interface : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : marketing : we ca n't do anything else . warning , finish meeting now . industrial designer : we 're done . project manager : okay , project e uh industrial designer : is this it ? project manager : well , we were gon na what look take a look at the last sheet . marketing : yeah , sure . industrial designer : okay . marketing : no , we ca n't . project manager : yeah , we have to yeah , it 's user interface : no . marketing : yes , yes . celebration . i do n't see why , but industrial designer : where 's the champagne ? marketing : i think we got ta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest . user interface : yeah ? industrial designer : i do n't uh hear a bell . marketing : no , not yet . industrial designer : user interface : we can do it here then . marketing : alright , i 'll see you guys in a minute . user interface : can we ca n't we do it here ? marketing : i do n't think so . i do n't know . i do n't i do n't think so . user interface : industrial designer : uh-huh . just fill that one in . user interface : yeah , we 're doing now . but it 's . oh , okay . project manager : uh , i do n't know ."}

no ? okay . thank you . item 2 this morning , then , is a further session on our follow-up on our 'mind over matter ' report . i 'm very pleased to welcome carol shillabeer , who is chief executive of powys teaching health board , and who manages the together for children and young people programme . thank you very much for attending , and thank you for the written update that you provided in advance to the committee . we 've got a lot of ground that we want to cover this morning , so if it 's okay we 'll go straight into questions . if i can just start and ask you if you 're satisfied with the progress that 's been made since the programme was established in 2015 . carol shillabeer : thank you very much for that question , chair . i 've got to say 'yes ' , in many regards . so , the key focus of the programme in the early stages was about improving access to specialist child and adolescent mental health services . we developed the windscreen model—or we lifted the windscreen model . other models that are very similar have been talked about as well , and our big focus was on ensuring that we could make immediate progress around access to specialist camhs . it 's some years ago now since this committee did the original report , and obviously healthcare inspectorate wales and the wales audit office had done reports in the past , and i think there was a need for a programme that could focus on action . you 'll see in the written update that we covered quite a large number of areas , and so therefore had to make a prioritisation . the prioritisation was at the specialist camhs end . we have provided the committee with a red , amber or green rating of where we feel that we were , and that was just before submission of the evidence . overall i would say we have made progress . i recognise you recognise that in your 'mind over matter ' report , and that is pleasing . what i would say , though , is that there 's a still a lot to be done . certainly over the last nine months or so , we 've seen a real momentum around the whole-school approach work , which we 're not actually leading now as a programme , although we facilitated the workshop held in september . but that 's got a real momentum , and the absolute priority now is the early help and enhanced support part of the work moving forward , and i 'm sure we will come on to that in more detail . but we know there is more community workforce in specialist camhs , we know we 're seeing children in a shorter time frame , and we know we 're accepting more referrals , so our indicators are telling us we are making progress . lynne neagle am : thank you . and you referred to the work on the whole-school approach , which is very welcome , and i recognise that the programme has been involved in driving that as well . but i 'm sure you 'll also recognise the emphasis that the committee has placed on this being a whole-system approach to children and young people 's mental health , and we feel very strongly that if any of the areas get out of balance , then it will jeopardise the progress in other parts of the programme . are there any particular areas where you feel you have n't made enough progress that you 'd like to draw the committee 's attention to ? carol shillabeer : this is maybe about what the programme 's done , but really around the broader sense as well . i 'm going to be very straight and say we should have made more progress on psychological therapies . i 'm disappointed that we have n't . i 'm assured that we 've got capacity in place now and the drive in place to get the matrics cymru framework developed for children and young people . i 've had discussions with the national psychological therapies committee , who have owned this , and we 're working together more on this area . that 's not to say for one minute that health boards and local areas have n't been working on psychological therapy service provision and changing the models , but that is an area we should have made , i think , earlier progress on . there 's been a general reflection from myself and the together for children and young people programme board over the phase of the programme . i think we started very strongly ; i think we probably had a bit of a lull in the middle , if i 'm truthful about that—we had a change of personnel , and we really gathered a momentum over the last year or 18 months , and that has helped to push us from a focus on specialist camhs into that whole-school approach . but , if i could just agree with your comments about the whole system , it has to be the whole system and that 's why the real focus now on early help and enhanced support is critical . if i can just say , in case i do n't get a chance to say this later , i was delighted to see the focus on youth work yesterday , because what is clear is for that part , the early help and enhanced support , this is n't just about the nhs and it 's not just about education , it 's about every part of the system , really , which does make it more complex . but i just wanted to say that i think that youth work has perhaps not have the recognition that it 's needed and yesterday was a positive step . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . we 've got some questions now on early help and enhanced support from janet finch-saunders . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . good morning . in terms of local primary mental health support services , what is your understanding of the issues leading to some health boards not meeting the mental health ( wales ) measure 2010 targets for assessment and therapy for children and young people , and how much of this is due to an increase in demand ? carol shillabeer : yes , thanks very much . so , it 's important to say , i think , at the outset , just by way of reminder , that the target , quite rightly , changed for children and young people . the target changed some years ago for adults , so it was only right that there was an equalisation around children . so , the services were working , a couple of years ago , with significant demand and then a change in the standard . i think you 're absolutely right ; your question alludes to the fact that some health boards are struggling to maintain the full performance around seeing children , particularly within the 28 days . i would say— . and we 've had some discussion about whether the impact of the mental health measure has actually drawn perhaps some of the workforce , the staff , who would have been working at that earlier stage in local primary mental health , into a bit more of the secondary element , which is why the review being undertaken by the nhs delivery unit into primary care camhs is so critical , because , actually , if we do n't have—and i believe we do n't have—enough capacity in that part of the system , then referrals will move towards the more specialist end of this . so , i think we will have seen , by the evidence submission , that demand has increased , not just in wales but in the uk , and it has increased significantly . we are doing reasonably well at meeting that demand—so , we have more contacts , more staff , shorter access times , so that is a good news story . we 've not got it completely sustained at this stage , and therefore the focus of the delivery unit 's primary care camhs report is what more can we do in that part of the system to help to see children and young people or provide consultation and liaison to others and support people at that level of intervention . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . i know , from my own experience as a constituency am , i have families who tell me that they ca n't get into the early interventions and eventually things just become so—they end up in the more specialist ones and believe that that's— . and i do n't like to put it in resource terms , but it 's false economy in terms of the impact on the child and the family , but , obviously , in terms of cost as well . do you find that that 's a common theme across wales ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think that the thrust of that is absolutely right . so , we absolutely need to see children and families at the earliest intervention and that 's why this is a whole system , not compartmentalised . i think there have been really good attempts in a couple of areas of that greater reach out and that earlier help—hot clinics and those sorts of initiatives that help people not to get in a long queue for specialist camhs , but can be supported , often by telephone , at that earlier stage . my sense of where we go next , in terms of , you know , you talk about early help and enhanced support for all the 'missing middle ' , as you referred to it in your report , is to make sure we 've got a fully joined-up , multi-agency team approach to that . and i think that will need some resourcing to support that , yet to be fully determined . but yesterday 's announcement about youth work , the government 's commitment to primary care , camhs , et cetera—that 's all going to be very helpful to prevent those young people having to go into specialist camhs . and just a final note on that , if i may—at the beginning of the programme , we had a report from hafal called 'making sense ' and there were 10 key asks , if you like , of the system and the service from young people who had experience of the service . they said , 'please do n't medicalise it'—i 'm paraphrasing now , of course—'please do n't medicalise it ; please focus on supporting teachers and others who can support us at an earlier stage and then , when we really need help , please ensure that it is there at that more specialist level . ' that 's been a bit of a guiding principle for the programme . so , that reflects the questions that you were asking , really . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . what are the outcomes of the stakeholder workshop held last week on early help and enhanced support ? and how are the actions going to be taken forward and implemented ? and also , given that the together for children and young people programme comes to an end in october of this year , who , in your view , is best placed to forward this work stream , and what will be the biggest challenges ? it 's a bit of a long question , so , break it up however you like . carol shillabeer : that 's absolutely fine . janet finch-saunders am : and what will be the biggest challenges that they will face ? carol shillabeer : yes , i think that 's helpfully laid out in three stages . so , you 're absolutely right , there was a highly successful workshop last week really focusing on early help and enhanced support . it brought all of the agencies together , which was—and actually had a bit of a waiting list , apparently , for places . so , there was a lot of demand and a lot of interest in this . in relation to the next steps , there is a planning group reflection in early july , in terms of the outcomes of the workshop or the outputs of the workshop , and there are three commitments that have been made to this stage . one is that we develop those values-led approaches that will bring multiple agencies together to have that common purpose . the second one is to develop the ingredients for successful working in this area , and then , thirdly , to determine or propose priorities and sequencing of next steps . so , that 's the next stage of that . i 'm pretty sure we 'll come on shortly—or hopefully—to the potential of the regional partnership boards . there is some work that we are doing as a programme with the children 's commissioner in terms of working more with the regional partnership boards in taking forward this work . so , that will run alongside . but during the summer , then , we will be developing that framework approach , and we will be participating in the association of directors of social services conference in september , and then a follow-up workshop in october on this matter . on your question of 'well , what happens after the programme ? ' we are currently working on legacy arrangements for the programme . i 'm pretty secure on the specialist camhs element . that will move , most likely , to the camhs network , which is part of the nhs mental health network . i actually chair the mental health network and that 's one part of that . the whole-school approach element is already settled in government and we 've got a connection in to that . the question that 's outstanding is where the early help and enhanced support and the neurodevelopmental will go . i am currently in discussions with welsh government officials around that . i can be very clear of my own view that there needs to be a confident and clear legacy arrangement for this work . we can not afford that we 've come so far for this not now to proceed . i think there 's a huge momentum behind this . i do n't see there would be any obstacles—i hope—in getting that commitment translated into a strong approach , as we move forward . so , i 'm not in a position to say , 'and the legacy arrangements will be— ' , but i am in a position to say that i 'm having those discussions with welsh government officials . they know my view that we 've got to put something in place that is strong and secure as we move forward , and i believe that they are supportive of that . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . lynne neagle am : janet , i think those two questions have been touched on , the remaining questions . we are going to discuss in more detail the legacy arrangements , but if i could just ask on psychological therapies : you referred to the fact that you were a bit disappointed with progress in this area , and the area has n't been directly led on by the together for children and young people programme . do you think that means now that there is more of a threat to progress in this area , because , you know , we 've got different compartmentalising of actions , and this is absolutely key , is n't it , really ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think there's— . there is some refinement to be done , i think , in making sure the connections are there . so , i think , as we move to programme end , we 'll want to be absolutely assured that there are no strands left hanging , so to speak . i am confident—i mentioned the mental health network board that i chair—that we have those strands nailed down , but recognising that the early help and enhanced support and the provision of psychological support is beyond the nhs . so , this will be an area that needs to be very much seen as a key part of that . my own sense is that— . there 's been quite a lot of other developments through the life of the programme . so , in the evidence that i 've provided , you 'll see the first 1000 days , all the adverse childhood experiences work , the cymru well wales partnership , et cetera , et cetera . so , there is a bit of what i would call tidying up of the landscape to be done , and this is the ideal opportunity to do that . lynne neagle am : okay . thank you . we 've got some questions now on specialist camhs—if i can just ask about the impact of the specialist camhs framework , and how effective you feel that has been in promoting a consistent delivery of care for young people . carol shillabeer : thanks very much for that . without wanting to go back too far in history , i remember coming into this area back in 2014 as i was asked to establish a camhs network . my observation was there was n't really a strong and well-connected clinical community in this area . when we spin forward five years , i can confidently say that there is a strong and well-connected clinical community around specialist camhs . the programme has helped ; the emphasis and the focus of the programme has helped to bring people together with that more common endeavour to understand , actually , there is a good case for consistency in the main , with local variation . there has been a case for much greater learning between organisations . if i just give you an example—you 'll know that the community intensive service teams were put in place in 2015-ish . some areas have them , but a lot of areas did n't . we do have inconsistency in that , but the consistent part is there is a service now right the way across wales for more intensive support to children and young people and their families in their own homes , which helps to prevent admissions and then , where there are admissions , helps to support people to be at home . they 're all called slightly different things . so , i might have referred in my papers to citt , catt , cot and cite . so , they 've all got slightly different names and they 've got slightly different opening hours . the key thrust of this is that there is a backbone , if you like , of a consistent approach with that local variation . we have to check . so , things like frameworks for improvement—there is a coming together of the clinicians and the professionals to agree what that framework for improvement is . that then gets implemented , with some local variation . so , i think the process of moving in that way has been extremely helpful . there will be some variation . we want some variation , to some extent , as places try new things and evaluate new things . so , if i just refer to the previous question that i had , and i talked about hot clinics and different ways of reaching out ; that 's been tried in one area , been evaluated—let 's see the spread of that . so , you 'll know my view on internet counselling , for example ; i feel that is quite a strong offer for children—not necessarily in the specialist end . if that works in one area , why are n't we rolling that out to other areas ? so , i think the framework for improvement has provided a vehicle for those clinicians and professionals to come together . it 's in a stronger place—a much stronger place—than it was five years ago . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . you 've referred to there being some inconsistencies in terms of crisis care , but are you able to assure the committee that all young people are now getting at least a consistent service , especially in terms of interventions in the instances of young people self-harming . wherever you live in wales , is that help there for you now ? carol shillabeer : well , in your work to produce the 'mind over matter ' report , i clearly listened to the views from the police and the recommendations in relation to the police . we 've taken that as a further piece of work under the specialist camhs umbrella , to truly understand what the experiences of the police are and what some of the root issues may be in relation to that . for example , is it that because the cit , cat , cot , cite—the community intensive service—closes at 10 o'clock in a certain area , that actually it 's after that that the network of support is n't as strong , and , if that is the case , what are we going to do about that ? there 's certainly potential in working more regionally or even working between adults ' and children 's in terms of the crisis resolution services that work beyond those hours . so , we are taking an extra look at this , because i could not be 100 per cent confident that , throughout the 24-hour period , we 've got this fully settled . i continue to hear some stories from the police that they are picking up young people and feeling that they 've not got that solid place to go , and we 're following those through . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . we 've got some questions now from hefin david on neurodevelopmental services . hefin david am : i think , chair , i should have declared an interest here , as my daughter has been diagnosed with autism and is currently going through the process of receiving neurodevelopmental speech and language support particularly . we 're seeing an increase in neurodevelopmental referrals , and that will increase further in the future . can you give us an explanation as to why this demand is growing and how we 're going to meet capacity to deliver and for support for those children ? carol shillabeer : thank you . they 're very big questions in terms of 'why ' . i 'm not sure that anyone really knows why , if i 'm honest , although there is a lot of academic research going on . what we do know is that we are starting to see the scale of those referrals coming through . so , in the information provided , i refer to the nhs digital prevalence report in england , which indicates that about 5.5 per cent of two to four-year-olds have a mental disorder . now , that sounds a bit shocking when we say that , but that 's in the international classification scaling , and , of that , certainly , 2.5 per cent is around autism . i can just testify , in real life , that demand is absolutely growing . so , if i just take my own health board for a moment , we usually have about 75 referrals per year . last year we had 300 . so , that has felt very difficult to manage . if i can just give you a sense of what we 've done so far and then what i think is next , i want to recognise the work of dr cath norton and the steering group that 's been established on neurodevelopmental issues under the programme . they had a standing start . they 've done a lot of very , very good work . we now have seven teams in place across wales . we now have a national pathway . we now have a community-of-practice-type environment , and we 're really getting into this . good progress has been made . more people have been seen . more people have been assessed . so , we have made progress . but i 've got a long list of considerations that i think respond to your question . one is that most referrals that come through , the clinicians tell me , are seeking support to move through what they perceive to be a gateway for educational support . so , that is often the reason why people come . now , that is obviously going to be linked to the whole-school approach and how we can support that . demand is outstripping supply . so , our clinical teams are concerned about how do they keep up . so , if i just take my own example of 300 in the last year , we 're looking to try and put some additional capacity in to support seeing those families , but also then to understand what the long-term trajectory is going to be . because we 've put these teams in , because we 've got the new pathway , has that opened a gate and we 've got a lot of backlog or is that the pattern ? hefin david am : can i just ask a question there ? so , with regard to the 75 to 300 increase—in the space of a year was that ? carol shillabeer : in a year , yes . hefin david am : did you anticipate that or was that something that just came totally unexpected ? carol shillabeer : i think we anticipated a few more , and just to say that in my— hefin david am : but not on that scale . carol shillabeer : no , not on that scale . and in my own health board—i 'm just referring to my own , and i 'm happy to share the information on this—we already had a service in place . so , it was n't as if we had nothing in place previously . we had a nice-compliant service already in place , but we knew we needed to expand that , which we have done , but we did n't anticipate 300 . so , this is happening not just across wales , actually , but across the uk—so , this greater recognition , the desire for families coming forward to access that support and them seeing this as a route , which is really important . what i would also say , and this is part of the bigger picture that we need to consider going forward , is that only about 40 per cent to 50 per cent of those families that come forward have what i would call or the clinicians would call a diagnosis—so , a threshold or whatever term you want to use that takes people through to that educational support . so , we 've got a lot of people who are under that threshold , but that 's a lot of people who still need help and support . i 'm trying to very fairly and , i hope , appropriately represent the very strong views coming from the group—the workstream under the programme . we 've got to tackle all of that . it 's not going to be good enough for us just to focus our attention on those children and young people and their families who reach a threshold , because there are needs elsewhere as well , and some of that will overlap with the early help and enhanced support . some of that overlaps with learning disability services . can i just mention a few more things , as i 'm on roll on neurodevelopmental ? hefin david am : it 's up to the chair . lynne neagle am : yes , go on . carol shillabeer : is that all right ? sorry , i know it 's a very long answer . there is a concern from the neurodevelopmental group to get across that whilst there has been a lot of focus on autism—and we recognise the private member 's bill—there are other neurodevelopmental presentations and there 's a real— . having the broadest view would be advised by them , and i think they 're particularly keen to understand what a future vision and what we call , say , a 'perfect world ' would look like . that 's the piece of work that we 're wanting to do now . in terms of giving advice at the end of the programme and into legacy arrangements , about what the big , big things are , we are still needing to tackle . hefin david am : i mean , i personally took a very personal decision when it came to the member 's bill on autism you were talking about—and that was the advice i received . you need to look at the wider symptoms that are presented beyond autism and other neurological conditions . so , i 'm glad you said that , because it gives me— . because i did n't vote for that bill , and i 'm glad you said that because it gives me some personal reassurance there . but what i do have concerns about is if the increase was n't anticipated to the extent that it was and that the together for children and young people programme has a duty to review capacity , after october who 's going to make sure that that capacity 's reviewed on a strategic basis ? carol shillabeer : so , i should have probably added in that we 've got a piece of work under way at the moment—welsh government commissioned it—by a person called patrick holton , and he is specifically looking at the demands on capacity in relation to neurodevelopmental . i think getting that slightly more independent view of what we think the trends are going to be over the long term will mean we can plan for the long term . we know that money 's been put into this and it has had an important impact , but we now need to be planning for the next three , five , 10 and many years beyond that . there is the integrated autism service . i think there are some conversations , when i talk about the landscape being quite busy , about the sense of where this links as we support people through their lives with a neurodevelopmental issue . so , it 's not just about a childhood thing ; as people move through , we 've got to get much better at that long-term planning . so , that piece of work is really important . we will get the report of that over the next couple of months in order for this sort of perfect-world picture that we want to try to describe to be informed by that . it also connects to the early help and enhanced support , because recognising if we just say half of the people who come for an assessment do n't meet a threshold for a certain category , that 's a lot of people who will need help and support to manage and cope with their condition and their situation . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . if we can just move on now to in-patient care , and if i can just ask you what the programme has been doing to address some of the challenges and opportunities we face in terms of camhs in-patient care , particularly in light of the restrictions that are in place in abergele and tŷ llidiard . carol shillabeer : yes , thank you very much for that question . again , quite a lot of progress has been made in the early part of the programme around in-patients , and you are very well aware of the challenges over the last year or 18 months in relation to both units . i think , certainly , there is some recovery in the position in north wales , and the programme did a peer review visit to north wales , which i think was very helpful . in terms of where the programme has been on this issue , there is some work under way , at quite an advanced stage , around the art of the possible around enhancing the scope of the services . this was quite a tricky thing to start off when you 're in a position where , actually , there 've been some restrictions , to then ask the service to think about going even further , but we really wanted to see what the art of the possible would be if we could attract the right workforce , get the right environment , et cetera , et cetera—so , that piece of work , the review of the specification about what could be possible . clearly , we work very closely with welsh health specialised services committee as the commissioner , so we do n't commission that . we neither performance manage those environments . but , if i can just say , probably the most important part of moving forward now is the longer term work between health and social care in terms of having a much more integrated and joined up approach for children . we believe there would probably be about 100 children who have experienced care in multiple settings . we have n't got that mature approach in terms of these being joined-up teams ; we 've got social care and we 've got healthcare . there is a growing appetite to do something different . there is a meeting with the children 's commissioner on 9 july to explore that . i 've previously had conversations with the chief inspector of care inspectorate wales , for example , and we have now got , i think , a consensus growing that we need to do something very different for children and young people who are in this sort of need for the future . we also know that there 've been some high-profile legal cases as well . so , we 've got to move to that step now . it has been largely successful , the work that has taken place over recent years , but not without its key challenges . lynne neagle am : thank you . and , just briefly on the new specification that whssc are developing , that will enable admissions at weekends and out of hours . how concerned should we be about that being a challenge , particularly in abergele , where staffing has been a major issue ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think we need to be very mindful of ensuring that the right workforce are in place before that gets implemented . the peer review highlighted the challenge of the physical environment , where the unit is , the challenge across north wales of the workforce . these are issues well known by the health board , by the way , so it was n't a surprise to them . but that dialogue about how do we ensure that we 've got the right workforce , because that unit , potentially , could—you know , it 's an isolated unit , and they ’ ve been risk-managing . they 've been managing the types of young people that they can take bearing in mind the workforce that they 've got available , and that 's been entirely the right thing to do . but the downside of that is it 's not as accessible as we would want . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . hefin david has got some questions on workforce now . hefin david am : yes . with regard to the increased camhs posts that have been made available between 2016 and 2018—a 62 per cent increase in camhs posts—we know that there 's likely to be labour market demand , high labour market demand , in those instances , so are the vacancy rates higher in wales than elsewhere , given the increase in those posts to be filled ? carol shillabeer : so , you 're absolutely right . there 's been quite a lot of investment , and there have been quite a lot of new recruits coming to the service . we had in the early days a situation where we were largely robbing peter to pay paul , to be quite frank . so , as new services were being developed , people would move from one part of the system to the other . so , in the early days there was little net gain . that has improved slightly , but we 're in a national context , particularly around nursing and around some specialties in medicine , of a national shortage , so this is not a quick fix . we are starting to see a greater diversity of workforce . so , if i can mention psychology assistants , for example , my own health board is employing more psychology assistants as part of a skill mix team , rather than going to where we might have been more traditionally based . we see some of that through the nhs benchmarking , particularly with england . they have more of that . we 're perhaps a little bit— hefin david am : more of what ? carol shillabeer : they have more skill mix in their workforce . we 're catching up a bit more on that now . hefin david am : just to clarify there , what you 're referring to—there are more nursing and medical staff in the wales system and more psychological staff , experts , in the uk picture . is that— ? carol shillabeer : in the england picture . so , england had a programme called iapt , which is about psychological therapies , and had therefore looked at the skill mix . some of that was— . we 've chatted to colleagues in england , trying to learn—we 're all trying to make improvements in this area , of course ; it 's a uk and international issue—what were their experiences of this psychological therapies approach . because of their vacancies they had to skill mix , and because of the money that they had available—they did n't have as much of a cash injection as perhaps we 've been able to secure . so , they skill mixed much earlier ; we 're skill mixing now . we 're using different types of roles , for example . and if i can just make a plea , really , around recognising the input of the third sector—so , it does n't always have to be an nhs-employed person to work in service provision , direct front-line service provision , and the third sector are offering a significant contribution in a number of areas of our services . and that is one that we will need to cultivate , because , to be quite frank , our recruitment challenges wo n't be solved overnight . we 've recognised that the commissioning numbers for nursing and other professionals have gone up over recent times , but , with the training time , it 's not a quick fix . hefin david am : does the workforce profile remain different , or are they starting to— ? carol shillabeer : they 're starting to come together . there is a—graph 13 in terms of the camhs profile . each year we do the nhs benchmarking , and we can see where we are compared to others , and i would expect over the next year or two that we see a bit more narrowing . hefin david am : so , if you compare a child in wales with a child in england in the last two years who 's been through this , would they have had a different experience as a result , and different clinical advice as a result , or is there consistency despite the difference in workforce profile ? carol shillabeer : that 's quite a big question . hand on heart , could i tell you i absolutely know the detail of that ? no , i could n't . the practice in this area is guided by national institute for health and care excellence guidance , so it 's pretty much guided . we would expect all of our practitioners to be able to work to nice guidance . when you skill mix a team , you enable the right referrals to go to the right person , so you would n't necessarily have a child or young person with particularly complex needs—well , you would match them to the right practitioner for their needs . so , it does— . and we 've seen some of that ; if i just make reference to the panel approach in gwent that 's been developed , a multi-agency panel come together , a referral comes in , it 's then about matching the right service and the right person to the needs that are being presented . so , we can be much more flexible in relation to that , and we have to be careful to use the right resource for the right person , because , if we 've got a resource that is highly specialist , we want them to be dealing with those children and young people . hefin david am : and one of the things you 're able to do—because there 's a lot about the labour market you ca n't control , but one of the things you can control is workforce development and ongoing workforce development . you 've mentioned communities of practice . what other things are being done in addition , and how do the communities of practice work might be a good question , but what else is being done in order to upskill and develop and grow the existing workforce that is presented to you ? carol shillabeer : thank you for that . so , there 's a couple of things around— . i think there 's a huge focus on staff retention now , not just in wales but across the uk . so , we 've got recruitment but we 've got retention . what are the factors that affect retention ? actually , well-being , well-being at work—and you 'll know that within ' a healthier wales ' the focus on staff engagement , staff well-being , has been laid out—the ability to work well in teams and the culture of organisations and services , and , then , as you rightly say , training and development and career opportunities . so , the developments over the last few years have brought training opportunities and career development opportunities as well . i think the community of practice—it 's something that has become a bit of a standard now across these areas—actually brings people together doing collective audit , doing collective reflection on service improvement , and being very clear about learning from one another . and , if you 're a clinician , that gives you a lot of motivation to keep driving forward . so , i think we have the fundamental building blocks in place , but there is more to do around the environment in which our practitioners and our staff operate . hefin david am : what about the welsh language in the health board ? carol shillabeer : thank you very much . there are two elements , if i may , just on that . in your report of last year you highlighted the need to do further work on the use of the welsh language , and have we got enough welsh language practitioners where we need them . we are doing that piece of work . i 'm pleased to say that , over the last few years , i think all health boards have really stepped up in terms of being able to understand the levels of welsh speaking amongst employed staff and where their welsh-speaking communities are . we 're particularly looking at it in terms of in-patient camhs and community intensive services , because , particularly when people are feeling at their most vulnerable , they would choose the language they wish to choose . so , we know we need to respond to that . so , we will be in a position to , by the end of this programme , provide that position statement on what happens next . i would also say , of course , we 've got the welsh language standards that we are all working on at the moment , and we 've got a very clear programme of when we have to be compliant with those standards . so , that element is very high on the priority list . lynne neagle am : thank you . suzy davies has a question about looked-after children . suzy davies am : yes . thank you , chair . obviously , everything you 've been speaking about already , particularly about workforce development , applies to children in care as well , where there 's other work also going on in terms of support . can you give us some indication about how the programme intersects , then , with the outcomes for the children in care work programme ? carol shillabeer : thanks very much for that . so , we have one of our members of the programme board also sitting on the outcomes for children ministerial group , which is good . so , we 've got that cross-link . we also have a director of social services on our programme board and , obviously , they 're very clearly linked in to the outcomes for children . i just made reference to , under the question on specialist camhs in-patients , the need to bring those services together , and that , really , is the need for much stronger working between the outcomes for children group and the together for children and young people programme and the constituent parts . so , i 'm confident that that has been pegged now . we 've got a way forward and there is a consensus that we need to do things together on that . suzy davies am : can you just perhaps give us an example of how that then looks on the ground ? because it 's great that people are talking together , but how would that affect , i do n't know , individual members of the workforce , or , indeed , the children we 're talking about ? carol shillabeer : yes . so , if i just give an example of a unit in south wales that is a social care unit , we 've been having discussions about , 'well , actually , should n't you have a psychologist and good access to psychological therapies , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera ? ' so , we have n't yet got an agreed position on how we 're going to do this , but the position is that something needs to be done , and there is an appetite for and an understanding of the case for change , i believe . but what it will mean , i think , in practice , is that you get much more fluid roles moving across sectors , or we could be designing services that are fully integrated . now , there may be challenges in that , but , you know , let 's get them out on the table . so , in terms of this seamless health and social care system for wales , this is one of the tests of that , i would say : can we , within the next five years , 10 years , really bring that together ? that will take quite a lot of work and commitment . on the looked-after children specifically , we have picked that up , particularly following your previous report , looking specifically at the assessment of young people who are care experienced who are in the system . absolutely , part of the health assessment is emotional health and mental health . we are questioning whether that needs to be a greater part and what the level of support needs to be , particularly because of the backgrounds of children that have led them to be in those circumstances . that 's a core piece of work under the early help and enhanced support work stream , and we 'll be ensuring that that is complete by the end of the programme . suzy davies am : okay . and you 're confident that that will reach children who are being fostered and perhaps do n't have very frequent looked-after children reviews , because , from all other perspectives , things are going fairly well . carol shillabeer : yes . and , of course , there 's the edge-of-care work that the government have been supporting , and , certainly in my own area , under the regional partnership board , we have a start well programme , which is the old children and young people 's partnership programme , where there 's a significant investment in supporting children and young people , families , on the edge of care , which does pick up fostering . suzy davies am : ah , lovely . thank you . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : dawn has a question on transition . dawn bowden am : yes . thank you , chair . we 've heard , not necessarily just in the context of this report , because we 've heard similar evidence around transition arrangements in another committee report when we did the suicide prevention , and i 've in fact only recently—well , just this week , actually—met with community mental health teams in my constituency , and there is still some concern about transitional arrangements from children into adult services . now , i know we had the— . the transition guidance was published a couple of years ago now , and the programme was involved in developing that guidance . but what 's your assessment of the impact that it 's had ? because we clearly are still seeing people falling through the gaps , are n't we ? carol shillabeer : yes , thank you for that . you 're absolutely right ; we developed that guidance and we are currently in the process of the evaluation of that . and , in particular , i know that the children 's commissioner is very focused on transition , not just around children in receipt of emotional mental health support , but children in paediatric wards , and there is a working group with welsh government looking at this . the children 's commissioner has used our guidance to put that on the table to say , 'well , if this works , this needs to be considered as a model for using elsewhere ' . but the big question there is 'if ' . so , we do want to get evaluation . if i were just to give an estimate of where i think this will land , i think it will have made improvements , but there may well be some further work to do in enhancing , supporting , auditing that every child is supported in line with that guidance . so , i talked about community practice and clinical audit : is this something that we make , then , a mandatory audit , each year , that we do that double check ? because it 's one of those things where we know when a child is 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , so what 's stopping us ? if indeed the evaluation says it 's not happening everywhere , it 's not happening early enough , what is stopping us ? we really need to get underneath that . so , my sense will be it will show us , it will be better , but there 's some further work to do , and following that up in terms of audit and making sure that we 've got a systematic approach to dealing with those who have n't had the guidance fully implemented , because it can make a real difference . dawn bowden am : yes , and it seems to me—you 've just talked about having a systematic approach , and it does seem to me that it is a systematic process , is n't it ? so , it should n't be difficult . i know we 're talking about in the health service things should n't be difficult and they are , and one of the gripes—i had a meeting with the community health team—was the problems of the new it systems and so on—let 's not go there at the moment . but , really , this is just about referring children and having a smooth transition from the service being provided to them as a child and then just shifting it over to the adult services . it should n't be difficult . it 's really difficult to get my head around why that is such a problem and why that needs to be so difficult . carol shillabeer : can i add one other dimension in , which i think is going to be quite interesting ? we talk about transitions being an issue—and we know it 's not just in mental health , but it 's elsewhere—then you start to think , 'what if we could reduce transitions ? ' , so you reduce the number of transitions and you manage them better . we are doing a piece of work with government on the potential to explore what a 0-25-type service would be . we know that in different places they have approached that—in australia and places in the uk . there are probably some pros and cons , but should we be moving to a 0-25 . that is moving the transition at the age of 25 , but at least it 's not at the eighteenth birthday . what 's the argument around what adolescent , young people and young adults services are , for example ? that piece of research and understanding— dawn bowden am : you could probably have a gradual transition , then , could n't you ? carol shillabeer : quite potentially . i 've got some people who have joined my own health board who 've worked in that 0-25-type service , and we 're catching up—'tell me what was good about it ? tell me what was not so good about it ? what did the young people themselves think about that ? ' . because if we can manage down the numbers of transitions , there really should be no excuse not to get transitions right , then . dawn bowden am : okay , thank you . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : okay . we 've got some really important questions now about legacy , because throughout the session this morning you 've referred to ongoing work , really , and that is a major concern for the committee . suzy davies . suzy davies am : yes , thank you , chair , we are a little bit worried that this programme is coming to an end in a matter of months when perhaps its work 's not been completed . obviously , we 've got the welsh government 's strategy for mental health running until 2022 , which is a few years longer . can you tell me whether you think your programme needs to continue , perhaps even if it 's just for the same length of time as together for mental health , or is its work done and it needs to be picked up now by a different system ? carol shillabeer : thank you for that . can i just say , i 've given this so much thought over the time , because i think you might have asked me this question when i came previously ? there are two ways to look at this . i 'm absolutely sure that the issue of children 's emotional and mental health will be one that will be with us for a very long time . we have made a lot of progress , i think , as a society , in talking about this now . we talk about mental health so much more than we ever used to . when i was a child , we never talked about it . i talk to my own children and say , 'what 's going on in your lives at school ? ' , and they talk about this . this is not an issue , if you like , that i believe you can pick up and solve literally in five years . this is one for the long term for us . so , on the one hand , i think my view last year was that , when you have a programme of work , you should have a start , a middle and end , really—otherwise it 's not a programme of work , it 's almost forever—and there is a moment to refresh and reflect on whether that mechanism has done all it should and it should move into a different mechanism . so , my position last year was , 'this will have been running for five years—we 've done a lot of work and made progress on specialist camhs , we have made progress on the whole-school approach and there is a different mechanism for this ' et cetera . my position now is i want to just be really sure and secure that there is a strong arrangement going forward that takes this work , if this programme is going to close . suzy davies am : are you sure ? carol shillabeer : not yet . so , i think , in an earlier question i indicated dialogue going on between myself and welsh government officials . i do n't think there 's a barrier—people are n't saying , 'no , it all needs to just stop ; we 've solved the issue ' , but the exact nature of the legacy arrangements , particularly for early help and enhanced support , are not yet fully determined , or for neurodevelopmental . if it was a choice between nothing being there and continuing this programme , i would be supporting continuing the programme . i do n't think we can stop now . suzy davies am : well , i do n't think any of us would disagree with that , but i suppose there might be a level of concern that the welsh government 's preferred route from now on would be through the regional partnership boards and public services boards . you mentioned that you 've done that work in gwent , down in the south-east of your patch there . it 's quite difficult for us to try and get a picture of how that will work successfully for the whole of wales . i know you 've got your experience in gwent , but have you thought a bit more about how it might look elsewhere , if that 's the route that government decides to pursue ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think the key question in my own mind is : are the regional partnership boards yet ready and mature enough to take this forward ? i 'm the chair of the powys regional partnership board , so i should declare that . there 's a lot being asked of the regional partnership boards at the moment— suzy davies am : well , we 'll be asking them to go with the 'mind over matter ' report , to make sure that that 's delivered upon . carol shillabeer : there 's a lot , you know , ' a healthier wales'— . everyone does feel that the regional partnership boards are a route to really secure multi-agency working , so there is quite a high expectation . my understanding—and this is a rather informal understanding—is that different rpbs are in different places . so , some have retained what used to be the old children and young people partnerships , and perhaps where they have been retained , they may be in a more progressed position . some are looking to have to re-establish those . so , my sense of this is that , i think , possibly the rpbs are n't yet in that position to be ready . our piece of work on early help and enhanced support , in terms of your earlier question about what 's the commitment—that feels that that may well be another year or 18 months of development work , alongside the rpb development work , to get that ready , before we can then more confidently say where we can hand over . suzy davies am : you may not feel able to say it , then , but would be wrong in saying that , actually , it would be quite a good idea to extend the current programme , just to make sure that anyone else who might be able to run on with component parts of it is in the position to do that to our satisfaction ? carol shillabeer : i 'm happy to respond to it . my sense is that , whether it 's the programme or whether it 's something else , something needs to be there . the next stage is really multi-agency , so it may well be that the programme currently has been nhs-led—maybe it needs to be led elsewhere , maybe not . i think there 's a view that this needs to continue . i 'm less wedded to it having to be the together for children and young people programme . it may be seen as a convenient mechanism—it 's already established , we 've got a programme team et cetera , so it may be seen as a ready sort of solution . i 'm not wedded to that . what i feel strongly about is that we 've got to have the right mechanism to take it forward . suzy davies am : can i just push you on one thing there ? you mentioned , perhaps , the nhs could lead on the work , for example . is there a risk of fragmentation if we start looking— ? i 'm just thinking—i mean , we 've got the elements here : we 've got the nhs , there 's the whole-school approach , early help and enhanced support and intervention , as you mentioned earlier . if that goes to one of the players in that multi-agency approach , is there a risk that they might become too dominant , inadvertently— ? carol shillabeer : if i can just clarify—apologies if i was n't clear . i said the current programme has been nhs-led , and that might be a reason to change . suzy davies am : to mix it up a bit . oh , right , okay . anything else you want me to pursue on that— ? lynne neagle am : can i just clarify for the record , carol—because we put this to the minister last week—are you looking at asking the regional partnership boards to take this work over from october 2019 ? are you saying clearly to the committee that you do not feel that all regional partnership boards are ready for that challenge at this point ? carol shillabeer : i 'm saying that on a more , if you like it , uniformed and informal basis , we 're doing some work with the children 's commissioner now in terms of— . i know the children 's commissioner 's very interested in how rpbs are managing , developing and dealing with the issues of children and young people 's concerns . we 're working with her to understand and to mirror alongside her the understanding of the rpbs . what i would say is that there has been some preparatory work by government around supporting rpbs . so , for example , in the integrated care fund guidance last year , there was a specific reference to child and adolescent emotional mental health , which i welcomed . i 've also welcomed , literally last week , a letter to all rpb chairs giving an allocation of £200,000 per rpb to support this further work in terms of child and adolescent emotional and mental health and the early help and support element . so , all of these things are in the right direction . my sense , and i need to stress it 's a sense because we have n't done that piece of work , is different rpbs are in different places . so , how confident can we be at the october date that we could hand over ? my sense is , just to safeguard , having a mechanism in place for the next 12 to 18 months to guide this through might be advisable , and that 's what i 'm talking to officials about . lynne neagle am : and that would either be an extension of the together for children and young people programme or something else . okay , thank you . suzy davies am : thank you . because i think there is a question , is n't there , about whether the rpbs will make this enough of a priority ? i 'm a bit nervous that it might get lost in that huge amount of work you said they might have . just a final question from me : how are you establishing what the young people themselves think about the end of the programme ? are they bothered about the structure of this at all or are they just concerned that they 're getting help ? how 's the stakeholder group feeding into this ? carol shillabeer : i 've not been blown over in the rush of people saying , 'do n't go anywhere . ' [ laughter . ] it 's a really important matter for young people . i know that later on you 're meeting with the youth parliament , you 're having a joint session , which is fantastic . we 've had contact with the youth parliament because we know it 's one of their top three issues . so , it runs in the vein of that this is going to be a long-term matter for young people , i think . whether they have a specific view on the programme , i do n't know . i 've not heard that . but i 'm pretty sure they will be vocal in saying , 'we have to have these developments continue . ' it is a major issue , we 're not there yet—maybe some progress has been made but there 's still a lot to do—and i think we 'll need to be able to respond to that . suzy davies am : anything particularly you want in addition to that ? lynne neagle am : no , i think that 's fine . and if i can just say that it was really great last week at the early help and enhanced day to see young people so central to the day all the way through . it was very , very important and very welcome . suzy davies am : carol , thank you for that . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : okay . we have come to the end of our time . we had a lot of things that we wanted to cover with you . we might need to drop you a line about a couple of things that we have n't covered , but can i thank you for your attendance this morning ? as usual , you 'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting , but thank you very much for your time . carol shillabeer : thank you , all .\n\n[Requirement] The translated text must be equal to 8192 words long.", "raw_data": "lynne neagle am : good morning , everyone , and welcome to the children , young people and education committee this morning . we 've received apologies for absence from siân gwenllian and there is no substitute this morning . can i ask if members have got any declarations of interest they 'd like to make , please ? no ? okay . thank you . item 2 this morning , then , is a further session on our follow-up on our 'mind over matter ' report . i 'm very pleased to welcome carol shillabeer , who is chief executive of powys teaching health board , and who manages the together for children and young people programme . thank you very much for attending , and thank you for the written update that you provided in advance to the committee . we 've got a lot of ground that we want to cover this morning , so if it 's okay we 'll go straight into questions . if i can just start and ask you if you 're satisfied with the progress that 's been made since the programme was established in 2015 . carol shillabeer : thank you very much for that question , chair . i 've got to say 'yes ' , in many regards . so , the key focus of the programme in the early stages was about improving access to specialist child and adolescent mental health services . we developed the windscreen model—or we lifted the windscreen model . other models that are very similar have been talked about as well , and our big focus was on ensuring that we could make immediate progress around access to specialist camhs . it 's some years ago now since this committee did the original report , and obviously healthcare inspectorate wales and the wales audit office had done reports in the past , and i think there was a need for a programme that could focus on action . you 'll see in the written update that we covered quite a large number of areas , and so therefore had to make a prioritisation . the prioritisation was at the specialist camhs end . we have provided the committee with a red , amber or green rating of where we feel that we were , and that was just before submission of the evidence . overall i would say we have made progress . i recognise you recognise that in your 'mind over matter ' report , and that is pleasing . what i would say , though , is that there 's a still a lot to be done . certainly over the last nine months or so , we 've seen a real momentum around the whole-school approach work , which we 're not actually leading now as a programme , although we facilitated the workshop held in september . but that 's got a real momentum , and the absolute priority now is the early help and enhanced support part of the work moving forward , and i 'm sure we will come on to that in more detail . but we know there is more community workforce in specialist camhs , we know we 're seeing children in a shorter time frame , and we know we 're accepting more referrals , so our indicators are telling us we are making progress . lynne neagle am : thank you . and you referred to the work on the whole-school approach , which is very welcome , and i recognise that the programme has been involved in driving that as well . but i 'm sure you 'll also recognise the emphasis that the committee has placed on this being a whole-system approach to children and young people 's mental health , and we feel very strongly that if any of the areas get out of balance , then it will jeopardise the progress in other parts of the programme . are there any particular areas where you feel you have n't made enough progress that you 'd like to draw the committee 's attention to ? carol shillabeer : this is maybe about what the programme 's done , but really around the broader sense as well . i 'm going to be very straight and say we should have made more progress on psychological therapies . i 'm disappointed that we have n't . i 'm assured that we 've got capacity in place now and the drive in place to get the matrics cymru framework developed for children and young people . i 've had discussions with the national psychological therapies committee , who have owned this , and we 're working together more on this area . that 's not to say for one minute that health boards and local areas have n't been working on psychological therapy service provision and changing the models , but that is an area we should have made , i think , earlier progress on . there 's been a general reflection from myself and the together for children and young people programme board over the phase of the programme . i think we started very strongly ; i think we probably had a bit of a lull in the middle , if i 'm truthful about that—we had a change of personnel , and we really gathered a momentum over the last year or 18 months , and that has helped to push us from a focus on specialist camhs into that whole-school approach . but , if i could just agree with your comments about the whole system , it has to be the whole system and that 's why the real focus now on early help and enhanced support is critical . if i can just say , in case i do n't get a chance to say this later , i was delighted to see the focus on youth work yesterday , because what is clear is for that part , the early help and enhanced support , this is n't just about the nhs and it 's not just about education , it 's about every part of the system , really , which does make it more complex . but i just wanted to say that i think that youth work has perhaps not have the recognition that it 's needed and yesterday was a positive step . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . we 've got some questions now on early help and enhanced support from janet finch-saunders . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . good morning . in terms of local primary mental health support services , what is your understanding of the issues leading to some health boards not meeting the mental health ( wales ) measure 2010 targets for assessment and therapy for children and young people , and how much of this is due to an increase in demand ? carol shillabeer : yes , thanks very much . so , it 's important to say , i think , at the outset , just by way of reminder , that the target , quite rightly , changed for children and young people . the target changed some years ago for adults , so it was only right that there was an equalisation around children . so , the services were working , a couple of years ago , with significant demand and then a change in the standard . i think you 're absolutely right ; your question alludes to the fact that some health boards are struggling to maintain the full performance around seeing children , particularly within the 28 days . i would say— . and we 've had some discussion about whether the impact of the mental health measure has actually drawn perhaps some of the workforce , the staff , who would have been working at that earlier stage in local primary mental health , into a bit more of the secondary element , which is why the review being undertaken by the nhs delivery unit into primary care camhs is so critical , because , actually , if we do n't have—and i believe we do n't have—enough capacity in that part of the system , then referrals will move towards the more specialist end of this . so , i think we will have seen , by the evidence submission , that demand has increased , not just in wales but in the uk , and it has increased significantly . we are doing reasonably well at meeting that demand—so , we have more contacts , more staff , shorter access times , so that is a good news story . we 've not got it completely sustained at this stage , and therefore the focus of the delivery unit 's primary care camhs report is what more can we do in that part of the system to help to see children and young people or provide consultation and liaison to others and support people at that level of intervention . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . i know , from my own experience as a constituency am , i have families who tell me that they ca n't get into the early interventions and eventually things just become so—they end up in the more specialist ones and believe that that's— . and i do n't like to put it in resource terms , but it 's false economy in terms of the impact on the child and the family , but , obviously , in terms of cost as well . do you find that that 's a common theme across wales ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think that the thrust of that is absolutely right . so , we absolutely need to see children and families at the earliest intervention and that 's why this is a whole system , not compartmentalised . i think there have been really good attempts in a couple of areas of that greater reach out and that earlier help—hot clinics and those sorts of initiatives that help people not to get in a long queue for specialist camhs , but can be supported , often by telephone , at that earlier stage . my sense of where we go next , in terms of , you know , you talk about early help and enhanced support for all the 'missing middle ' , as you referred to it in your report , is to make sure we 've got a fully joined-up , multi-agency team approach to that . and i think that will need some resourcing to support that , yet to be fully determined . but yesterday 's announcement about youth work , the government 's commitment to primary care , camhs , et cetera—that 's all going to be very helpful to prevent those young people having to go into specialist camhs . and just a final note on that , if i may—at the beginning of the programme , we had a report from hafal called 'making sense ' and there were 10 key asks , if you like , of the system and the service from young people who had experience of the service . they said , 'please do n't medicalise it'—i 'm paraphrasing now , of course—'please do n't medicalise it ; please focus on supporting teachers and others who can support us at an earlier stage and then , when we really need help , please ensure that it is there at that more specialist level . ' that 's been a bit of a guiding principle for the programme . so , that reflects the questions that you were asking , really . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . what are the outcomes of the stakeholder workshop held last week on early help and enhanced support ? and how are the actions going to be taken forward and implemented ? and also , given that the together for children and young people programme comes to an end in october of this year , who , in your view , is best placed to forward this work stream , and what will be the biggest challenges ? it 's a bit of a long question , so , break it up however you like . carol shillabeer : that 's absolutely fine . janet finch-saunders am : and what will be the biggest challenges that they will face ? carol shillabeer : yes , i think that 's helpfully laid out in three stages . so , you 're absolutely right , there was a highly successful workshop last week really focusing on early help and enhanced support . it brought all of the agencies together , which was—and actually had a bit of a waiting list , apparently , for places . so , there was a lot of demand and a lot of interest in this . in relation to the next steps , there is a planning group reflection in early july , in terms of the outcomes of the workshop or the outputs of the workshop , and there are three commitments that have been made to this stage . one is that we develop those values-led approaches that will bring multiple agencies together to have that common purpose . the second one is to develop the ingredients for successful working in this area , and then , thirdly , to determine or propose priorities and sequencing of next steps . so , that 's the next stage of that . i 'm pretty sure we 'll come on shortly—or hopefully—to the potential of the regional partnership boards . there is some work that we are doing as a programme with the children 's commissioner in terms of working more with the regional partnership boards in taking forward this work . so , that will run alongside . but during the summer , then , we will be developing that framework approach , and we will be participating in the association of directors of social services conference in september , and then a follow-up workshop in october on this matter . on your question of 'well , what happens after the programme ? ' we are currently working on legacy arrangements for the programme . i 'm pretty secure on the specialist camhs element . that will move , most likely , to the camhs network , which is part of the nhs mental health network . i actually chair the mental health network and that 's one part of that . the whole-school approach element is already settled in government and we 've got a connection in to that . the question that 's outstanding is where the early help and enhanced support and the neurodevelopmental will go . i am currently in discussions with welsh government officials around that . i can be very clear of my own view that there needs to be a confident and clear legacy arrangement for this work . we can not afford that we 've come so far for this not now to proceed . i think there 's a huge momentum behind this . i do n't see there would be any obstacles—i hope—in getting that commitment translated into a strong approach , as we move forward . so , i 'm not in a position to say , 'and the legacy arrangements will be— ' , but i am in a position to say that i 'm having those discussions with welsh government officials . they know my view that we 've got to put something in place that is strong and secure as we move forward , and i believe that they are supportive of that . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . lynne neagle am : janet , i think those two questions have been touched on , the remaining questions . we are going to discuss in more detail the legacy arrangements , but if i could just ask on psychological therapies : you referred to the fact that you were a bit disappointed with progress in this area , and the area has n't been directly led on by the together for children and young people programme . do you think that means now that there is more of a threat to progress in this area , because , you know , we 've got different compartmentalising of actions , and this is absolutely key , is n't it , really ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think there's— . there is some refinement to be done , i think , in making sure the connections are there . so , i think , as we move to programme end , we 'll want to be absolutely assured that there are no strands left hanging , so to speak . i am confident—i mentioned the mental health network board that i chair—that we have those strands nailed down , but recognising that the early help and enhanced support and the provision of psychological support is beyond the nhs . so , this will be an area that needs to be very much seen as a key part of that . my own sense is that— . there 's been quite a lot of other developments through the life of the programme . so , in the evidence that i 've provided , you 'll see the first 1000 days , all the adverse childhood experiences work , the cymru well wales partnership , et cetera , et cetera . so , there is a bit of what i would call tidying up of the landscape to be done , and this is the ideal opportunity to do that . lynne neagle am : okay . thank you . we 've got some questions now on specialist camhs—if i can just ask about the impact of the specialist camhs framework , and how effective you feel that has been in promoting a consistent delivery of care for young people . carol shillabeer : thanks very much for that . without wanting to go back too far in history , i remember coming into this area back in 2014 as i was asked to establish a camhs network . my observation was there was n't really a strong and well-connected clinical community in this area . when we spin forward five years , i can confidently say that there is a strong and well-connected clinical community around specialist camhs . the programme has helped ; the emphasis and the focus of the programme has helped to bring people together with that more common endeavour to understand , actually , there is a good case for consistency in the main , with local variation . there has been a case for much greater learning between organisations . if i just give you an example—you 'll know that the community intensive service teams were put in place in 2015-ish . some areas have them , but a lot of areas did n't . we do have inconsistency in that , but the consistent part is there is a service now right the way across wales for more intensive support to children and young people and their families in their own homes , which helps to prevent admissions and then , where there are admissions , helps to support people to be at home . they 're all called slightly different things . so , i might have referred in my papers to citt , catt , cot and cite . so , they 've all got slightly different names and they 've got slightly different opening hours . the key thrust of this is that there is a backbone , if you like , of a consistent approach with that local variation . we have to check . so , things like frameworks for improvement—there is a coming together of the clinicians and the professionals to agree what that framework for improvement is . that then gets implemented , with some local variation . so , i think the process of moving in that way has been extremely helpful . there will be some variation . we want some variation , to some extent , as places try new things and evaluate new things . so , if i just refer to the previous question that i had , and i talked about hot clinics and different ways of reaching out ; that 's been tried in one area , been evaluated—let 's see the spread of that . so , you 'll know my view on internet counselling , for example ; i feel that is quite a strong offer for children—not necessarily in the specialist end . if that works in one area , why are n't we rolling that out to other areas ? so , i think the framework for improvement has provided a vehicle for those clinicians and professionals to come together . it 's in a stronger place—a much stronger place—than it was five years ago . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . you 've referred to there being some inconsistencies in terms of crisis care , but are you able to assure the committee that all young people are now getting at least a consistent service , especially in terms of interventions in the instances of young people self-harming . wherever you live in wales , is that help there for you now ? carol shillabeer : well , in your work to produce the 'mind over matter ' report , i clearly listened to the views from the police and the recommendations in relation to the police . we 've taken that as a further piece of work under the specialist camhs umbrella , to truly understand what the experiences of the police are and what some of the root issues may be in relation to that . for example , is it that because the cit , cat , cot , cite—the community intensive service—closes at 10 o'clock in a certain area , that actually it 's after that that the network of support is n't as strong , and , if that is the case , what are we going to do about that ? there 's certainly potential in working more regionally or even working between adults ' and children 's in terms of the crisis resolution services that work beyond those hours . so , we are taking an extra look at this , because i could not be 100 per cent confident that , throughout the 24-hour period , we 've got this fully settled . i continue to hear some stories from the police that they are picking up young people and feeling that they 've not got that solid place to go , and we 're following those through . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . we 've got some questions now from hefin david on neurodevelopmental services . hefin david am : i think , chair , i should have declared an interest here , as my daughter has been diagnosed with autism and is currently going through the process of receiving neurodevelopmental speech and language support particularly . we 're seeing an increase in neurodevelopmental referrals , and that will increase further in the future . can you give us an explanation as to why this demand is growing and how we 're going to meet capacity to deliver and for support for those children ? carol shillabeer : thank you . they 're very big questions in terms of 'why ' . i 'm not sure that anyone really knows why , if i 'm honest , although there is a lot of academic research going on . what we do know is that we are starting to see the scale of those referrals coming through . so , in the information provided , i refer to the nhs digital prevalence report in england , which indicates that about 5.5 per cent of two to four-year-olds have a mental disorder . now , that sounds a bit shocking when we say that , but that 's in the international classification scaling , and , of that , certainly , 2.5 per cent is around autism . i can just testify , in real life , that demand is absolutely growing . so , if i just take my own health board for a moment , we usually have about 75 referrals per year . last year we had 300 . so , that has felt very difficult to manage . if i can just give you a sense of what we 've done so far and then what i think is next , i want to recognise the work of dr cath norton and the steering group that 's been established on neurodevelopmental issues under the programme . they had a standing start . they 've done a lot of very , very good work . we now have seven teams in place across wales . we now have a national pathway . we now have a community-of-practice-type environment , and we 're really getting into this . good progress has been made . more people have been seen . more people have been assessed . so , we have made progress . but i 've got a long list of considerations that i think respond to your question . one is that most referrals that come through , the clinicians tell me , are seeking support to move through what they perceive to be a gateway for educational support . so , that is often the reason why people come . now , that is obviously going to be linked to the whole-school approach and how we can support that . demand is outstripping supply . so , our clinical teams are concerned about how do they keep up . so , if i just take my own example of 300 in the last year , we 're looking to try and put some additional capacity in to support seeing those families , but also then to understand what the long-term trajectory is going to be . because we 've put these teams in , because we 've got the new pathway , has that opened a gate and we 've got a lot of backlog or is that the pattern ? hefin david am : can i just ask a question there ? so , with regard to the 75 to 300 increase—in the space of a year was that ? carol shillabeer : in a year , yes . hefin david am : did you anticipate that or was that something that just came totally unexpected ? carol shillabeer : i think we anticipated a few more , and just to say that in my— hefin david am : but not on that scale . carol shillabeer : no , not on that scale . and in my own health board—i 'm just referring to my own , and i 'm happy to share the information on this—we already had a service in place . so , it was n't as if we had nothing in place previously . we had a nice-compliant service already in place , but we knew we needed to expand that , which we have done , but we did n't anticipate 300 . so , this is happening not just across wales , actually , but across the uk—so , this greater recognition , the desire for families coming forward to access that support and them seeing this as a route , which is really important . what i would also say , and this is part of the bigger picture that we need to consider going forward , is that only about 40 per cent to 50 per cent of those families that come forward have what i would call or the clinicians would call a diagnosis—so , a threshold or whatever term you want to use that takes people through to that educational support . so , we 've got a lot of people who are under that threshold , but that 's a lot of people who still need help and support . i 'm trying to very fairly and , i hope , appropriately represent the very strong views coming from the group—the workstream under the programme . we 've got to tackle all of that . it 's not going to be good enough for us just to focus our attention on those children and young people and their families who reach a threshold , because there are needs elsewhere as well , and some of that will overlap with the early help and enhanced support . some of that overlaps with learning disability services . can i just mention a few more things , as i 'm on roll on neurodevelopmental ? hefin david am : it 's up to the chair . lynne neagle am : yes , go on . carol shillabeer : is that all right ? sorry , i know it 's a very long answer . there is a concern from the neurodevelopmental group to get across that whilst there has been a lot of focus on autism—and we recognise the private member 's bill—there are other neurodevelopmental presentations and there 's a real— . having the broadest view would be advised by them , and i think they 're particularly keen to understand what a future vision and what we call , say , a 'perfect world ' would look like . that 's the piece of work that we 're wanting to do now . in terms of giving advice at the end of the programme and into legacy arrangements , about what the big , big things are , we are still needing to tackle . hefin david am : i mean , i personally took a very personal decision when it came to the member 's bill on autism you were talking about—and that was the advice i received . you need to look at the wider symptoms that are presented beyond autism and other neurological conditions . so , i 'm glad you said that , because it gives me— . because i did n't vote for that bill , and i 'm glad you said that because it gives me some personal reassurance there . but what i do have concerns about is if the increase was n't anticipated to the extent that it was and that the together for children and young people programme has a duty to review capacity , after october who 's going to make sure that that capacity 's reviewed on a strategic basis ? carol shillabeer : so , i should have probably added in that we 've got a piece of work under way at the moment—welsh government commissioned it—by a person called patrick holton , and he is specifically looking at the demands on capacity in relation to neurodevelopmental . i think getting that slightly more independent view of what we think the trends are going to be over the long term will mean we can plan for the long term . we know that money 's been put into this and it has had an important impact , but we now need to be planning for the next three , five , 10 and many years beyond that . there is the integrated autism service . i think there are some conversations , when i talk about the landscape being quite busy , about the sense of where this links as we support people through their lives with a neurodevelopmental issue . so , it 's not just about a childhood thing ; as people move through , we 've got to get much better at that long-term planning . so , that piece of work is really important . we will get the report of that over the next couple of months in order for this sort of perfect-world picture that we want to try to describe to be informed by that . it also connects to the early help and enhanced support , because recognising if we just say half of the people who come for an assessment do n't meet a threshold for a certain category , that 's a lot of people who will need help and support to manage and cope with their condition and their situation . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . if we can just move on now to in-patient care , and if i can just ask you what the programme has been doing to address some of the challenges and opportunities we face in terms of camhs in-patient care , particularly in light of the restrictions that are in place in abergele and tŷ llidiard . carol shillabeer : yes , thank you very much for that question . again , quite a lot of progress has been made in the early part of the programme around in-patients , and you are very well aware of the challenges over the last year or 18 months in relation to both units . i think , certainly , there is some recovery in the position in north wales , and the programme did a peer review visit to north wales , which i think was very helpful . in terms of where the programme has been on this issue , there is some work under way , at quite an advanced stage , around the art of the possible around enhancing the scope of the services . this was quite a tricky thing to start off when you 're in a position where , actually , there 've been some restrictions , to then ask the service to think about going even further , but we really wanted to see what the art of the possible would be if we could attract the right workforce , get the right environment , et cetera , et cetera—so , that piece of work , the review of the specification about what could be possible . clearly , we work very closely with welsh health specialised services committee as the commissioner , so we do n't commission that . we neither performance manage those environments . but , if i can just say , probably the most important part of moving forward now is the longer term work between health and social care in terms of having a much more integrated and joined up approach for children . we believe there would probably be about 100 children who have experienced care in multiple settings . we have n't got that mature approach in terms of these being joined-up teams ; we 've got social care and we 've got healthcare . there is a growing appetite to do something different . there is a meeting with the children 's commissioner on 9 july to explore that . i 've previously had conversations with the chief inspector of care inspectorate wales , for example , and we have now got , i think , a consensus growing that we need to do something very different for children and young people who are in this sort of need for the future . we also know that there 've been some high-profile legal cases as well . so , we 've got to move to that step now . it has been largely successful , the work that has taken place over recent years , but not without its key challenges . lynne neagle am : thank you . and , just briefly on the new specification that whssc are developing , that will enable admissions at weekends and out of hours . how concerned should we be about that being a challenge , particularly in abergele , where staffing has been a major issue ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think we need to be very mindful of ensuring that the right workforce are in place before that gets implemented . the peer review highlighted the challenge of the physical environment , where the unit is , the challenge across north wales of the workforce . these are issues well known by the health board , by the way , so it was n't a surprise to them . but that dialogue about how do we ensure that we 've got the right workforce , because that unit , potentially , could—you know , it 's an isolated unit , and they ’ ve been risk-managing . they 've been managing the types of young people that they can take bearing in mind the workforce that they 've got available , and that 's been entirely the right thing to do . but the downside of that is it 's not as accessible as we would want . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . hefin david has got some questions on workforce now . hefin david am : yes . with regard to the increased camhs posts that have been made available between 2016 and 2018—a 62 per cent increase in camhs posts—we know that there 's likely to be labour market demand , high labour market demand , in those instances , so are the vacancy rates higher in wales than elsewhere , given the increase in those posts to be filled ? carol shillabeer : so , you 're absolutely right . there 's been quite a lot of investment , and there have been quite a lot of new recruits coming to the service . we had in the early days a situation where we were largely robbing peter to pay paul , to be quite frank . so , as new services were being developed , people would move from one part of the system to the other . so , in the early days there was little net gain . that has improved slightly , but we 're in a national context , particularly around nursing and around some specialties in medicine , of a national shortage , so this is not a quick fix . we are starting to see a greater diversity of workforce . so , if i can mention psychology assistants , for example , my own health board is employing more psychology assistants as part of a skill mix team , rather than going to where we might have been more traditionally based . we see some of that through the nhs benchmarking , particularly with england . they have more of that . we 're perhaps a little bit— hefin david am : more of what ? carol shillabeer : they have more skill mix in their workforce . we 're catching up a bit more on that now . hefin david am : just to clarify there , what you 're referring to—there are more nursing and medical staff in the wales system and more psychological staff , experts , in the uk picture . is that— ? carol shillabeer : in the england picture . so , england had a programme called iapt , which is about psychological therapies , and had therefore looked at the skill mix . some of that was— . we 've chatted to colleagues in england , trying to learn—we 're all trying to make improvements in this area , of course ; it 's a uk and international issue—what were their experiences of this psychological therapies approach . because of their vacancies they had to skill mix , and because of the money that they had available—they did n't have as much of a cash injection as perhaps we 've been able to secure . so , they skill mixed much earlier ; we 're skill mixing now . we 're using different types of roles , for example . and if i can just make a plea , really , around recognising the input of the third sector—so , it does n't always have to be an nhs-employed person to work in service provision , direct front-line service provision , and the third sector are offering a significant contribution in a number of areas of our services . and that is one that we will need to cultivate , because , to be quite frank , our recruitment challenges wo n't be solved overnight . we 've recognised that the commissioning numbers for nursing and other professionals have gone up over recent times , but , with the training time , it 's not a quick fix . hefin david am : does the workforce profile remain different , or are they starting to— ? carol shillabeer : they 're starting to come together . there is a—graph 13 in terms of the camhs profile . each year we do the nhs benchmarking , and we can see where we are compared to others , and i would expect over the next year or two that we see a bit more narrowing . hefin david am : so , if you compare a child in wales with a child in england in the last two years who 's been through this , would they have had a different experience as a result , and different clinical advice as a result , or is there consistency despite the difference in workforce profile ? carol shillabeer : that 's quite a big question . hand on heart , could i tell you i absolutely know the detail of that ? no , i could n't . the practice in this area is guided by national institute for health and care excellence guidance , so it 's pretty much guided . we would expect all of our practitioners to be able to work to nice guidance . when you skill mix a team , you enable the right referrals to go to the right person , so you would n't necessarily have a child or young person with particularly complex needs—well , you would match them to the right practitioner for their needs . so , it does— . and we 've seen some of that ; if i just make reference to the panel approach in gwent that 's been developed , a multi-agency panel come together , a referral comes in , it 's then about matching the right service and the right person to the needs that are being presented . so , we can be much more flexible in relation to that , and we have to be careful to use the right resource for the right person , because , if we 've got a resource that is highly specialist , we want them to be dealing with those children and young people . hefin david am : and one of the things you 're able to do—because there 's a lot about the labour market you ca n't control , but one of the things you can control is workforce development and ongoing workforce development . you 've mentioned communities of practice . what other things are being done in addition , and how do the communities of practice work might be a good question , but what else is being done in order to upskill and develop and grow the existing workforce that is presented to you ? carol shillabeer : thank you for that . so , there 's a couple of things around— . i think there 's a huge focus on staff retention now , not just in wales but across the uk . so , we 've got recruitment but we 've got retention . what are the factors that affect retention ? actually , well-being , well-being at work—and you 'll know that within ' a healthier wales ' the focus on staff engagement , staff well-being , has been laid out—the ability to work well in teams and the culture of organisations and services , and , then , as you rightly say , training and development and career opportunities . so , the developments over the last few years have brought training opportunities and career development opportunities as well . i think the community of practice—it 's something that has become a bit of a standard now across these areas—actually brings people together doing collective audit , doing collective reflection on service improvement , and being very clear about learning from one another . and , if you 're a clinician , that gives you a lot of motivation to keep driving forward . so , i think we have the fundamental building blocks in place , but there is more to do around the environment in which our practitioners and our staff operate . hefin david am : what about the welsh language in the health board ? carol shillabeer : thank you very much . there are two elements , if i may , just on that . in your report of last year you highlighted the need to do further work on the use of the welsh language , and have we got enough welsh language practitioners where we need them . we are doing that piece of work . i 'm pleased to say that , over the last few years , i think all health boards have really stepped up in terms of being able to understand the levels of welsh speaking amongst employed staff and where their welsh-speaking communities are . we 're particularly looking at it in terms of in-patient camhs and community intensive services , because , particularly when people are feeling at their most vulnerable , they would choose the language they wish to choose . so , we know we need to respond to that . so , we will be in a position to , by the end of this programme , provide that position statement on what happens next . i would also say , of course , we 've got the welsh language standards that we are all working on at the moment , and we 've got a very clear programme of when we have to be compliant with those standards . so , that element is very high on the priority list . lynne neagle am : thank you . suzy davies has a question about looked-after children . suzy davies am : yes . thank you , chair . obviously , everything you 've been speaking about already , particularly about workforce development , applies to children in care as well , where there 's other work also going on in terms of support . can you give us some indication about how the programme intersects , then , with the outcomes for the children in care work programme ? carol shillabeer : thanks very much for that . so , we have one of our members of the programme board also sitting on the outcomes for children ministerial group , which is good . so , we 've got that cross-link . we also have a director of social services on our programme board and , obviously , they 're very clearly linked in to the outcomes for children . i just made reference to , under the question on specialist camhs in-patients , the need to bring those services together , and that , really , is the need for much stronger working between the outcomes for children group and the together for children and young people programme and the constituent parts . so , i 'm confident that that has been pegged now . we 've got a way forward and there is a consensus that we need to do things together on that . suzy davies am : can you just perhaps give us an example of how that then looks on the ground ? because it 's great that people are talking together , but how would that affect , i do n't know , individual members of the workforce , or , indeed , the children we 're talking about ? carol shillabeer : yes . so , if i just give an example of a unit in south wales that is a social care unit , we 've been having discussions about , 'well , actually , should n't you have a psychologist and good access to psychological therapies , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera ? ' so , we have n't yet got an agreed position on how we 're going to do this , but the position is that something needs to be done , and there is an appetite for and an understanding of the case for change , i believe . but what it will mean , i think , in practice , is that you get much more fluid roles moving across sectors , or we could be designing services that are fully integrated . now , there may be challenges in that , but , you know , let 's get them out on the table . so , in terms of this seamless health and social care system for wales , this is one of the tests of that , i would say : can we , within the next five years , 10 years , really bring that together ? that will take quite a lot of work and commitment . on the looked-after children specifically , we have picked that up , particularly following your previous report , looking specifically at the assessment of young people who are care experienced who are in the system . absolutely , part of the health assessment is emotional health and mental health . we are questioning whether that needs to be a greater part and what the level of support needs to be , particularly because of the backgrounds of children that have led them to be in those circumstances . that 's a core piece of work under the early help and enhanced support work stream , and we 'll be ensuring that that is complete by the end of the programme . suzy davies am : okay . and you 're confident that that will reach children who are being fostered and perhaps do n't have very frequent looked-after children reviews , because , from all other perspectives , things are going fairly well . carol shillabeer : yes . and , of course , there 's the edge-of-care work that the government have been supporting , and , certainly in my own area , under the regional partnership board , we have a start well programme , which is the old children and young people 's partnership programme , where there 's a significant investment in supporting children and young people , families , on the edge of care , which does pick up fostering . suzy davies am : ah , lovely . thank you . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : dawn has a question on transition . dawn bowden am : yes . thank you , chair . we 've heard , not necessarily just in the context of this report , because we 've heard similar evidence around transition arrangements in another committee report when we did the suicide prevention , and i 've in fact only recently—well , just this week , actually—met with community mental health teams in my constituency , and there is still some concern about transitional arrangements from children into adult services . now , i know we had the— . the transition guidance was published a couple of years ago now , and the programme was involved in developing that guidance . but what 's your assessment of the impact that it 's had ? because we clearly are still seeing people falling through the gaps , are n't we ? carol shillabeer : yes , thank you for that . you 're absolutely right ; we developed that guidance and we are currently in the process of the evaluation of that . and , in particular , i know that the children 's commissioner is very focused on transition , not just around children in receipt of emotional mental health support , but children in paediatric wards , and there is a working group with welsh government looking at this . the children 's commissioner has used our guidance to put that on the table to say , 'well , if this works , this needs to be considered as a model for using elsewhere ' . but the big question there is 'if ' . so , we do want to get evaluation . if i were just to give an estimate of where i think this will land , i think it will have made improvements , but there may well be some further work to do in enhancing , supporting , auditing that every child is supported in line with that guidance . so , i talked about community practice and clinical audit : is this something that we make , then , a mandatory audit , each year , that we do that double check ? because it 's one of those things where we know when a child is 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , so what 's stopping us ? if indeed the evaluation says it 's not happening everywhere , it 's not happening early enough , what is stopping us ? we really need to get underneath that . so , my sense will be it will show us , it will be better , but there 's some further work to do , and following that up in terms of audit and making sure that we 've got a systematic approach to dealing with those who have n't had the guidance fully implemented , because it can make a real difference . dawn bowden am : yes , and it seems to me—you 've just talked about having a systematic approach , and it does seem to me that it is a systematic process , is n't it ? so , it should n't be difficult . i know we 're talking about in the health service things should n't be difficult and they are , and one of the gripes—i had a meeting with the community health team—was the problems of the new it systems and so on—let 's not go there at the moment . but , really , this is just about referring children and having a smooth transition from the service being provided to them as a child and then just shifting it over to the adult services . it should n't be difficult . it 's really difficult to get my head around why that is such a problem and why that needs to be so difficult . carol shillabeer : can i add one other dimension in , which i think is going to be quite interesting ? we talk about transitions being an issue—and we know it 's not just in mental health , but it 's elsewhere—then you start to think , 'what if we could reduce transitions ? ' , so you reduce the number of transitions and you manage them better . we are doing a piece of work with government on the potential to explore what a 0-25-type service would be . we know that in different places they have approached that—in australia and places in the uk . there are probably some pros and cons , but should we be moving to a 0-25 . that is moving the transition at the age of 25 , but at least it 's not at the eighteenth birthday . what 's the argument around what adolescent , young people and young adults services are , for example ? that piece of research and understanding— dawn bowden am : you could probably have a gradual transition , then , could n't you ? carol shillabeer : quite potentially . i 've got some people who have joined my own health board who 've worked in that 0-25-type service , and we 're catching up—'tell me what was good about it ? tell me what was not so good about it ? what did the young people themselves think about that ? ' . because if we can manage down the numbers of transitions , there really should be no excuse not to get transitions right , then . dawn bowden am : okay , thank you . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : okay . we 've got some really important questions now about legacy , because throughout the session this morning you 've referred to ongoing work , really , and that is a major concern for the committee . suzy davies . suzy davies am : yes , thank you , chair , we are a little bit worried that this programme is coming to an end in a matter of months when perhaps its work 's not been completed . obviously , we 've got the welsh government 's strategy for mental health running until 2022 , which is a few years longer . can you tell me whether you think your programme needs to continue , perhaps even if it 's just for the same length of time as together for mental health , or is its work done and it needs to be picked up now by a different system ? carol shillabeer : thank you for that . can i just say , i 've given this so much thought over the time , because i think you might have asked me this question when i came previously ? there are two ways to look at this . i 'm absolutely sure that the issue of children 's emotional and mental health will be one that will be with us for a very long time . we have made a lot of progress , i think , as a society , in talking about this now . we talk about mental health so much more than we ever used to . when i was a child , we never talked about it . i talk to my own children and say , 'what 's going on in your lives at school ? ' , and they talk about this . this is not an issue , if you like , that i believe you can pick up and solve literally in five years . this is one for the long term for us . so , on the one hand , i think my view last year was that , when you have a programme of work , you should have a start , a middle and end , really—otherwise it 's not a programme of work , it 's almost forever—and there is a moment to refresh and reflect on whether that mechanism has done all it should and it should move into a different mechanism . so , my position last year was , 'this will have been running for five years—we 've done a lot of work and made progress on specialist camhs , we have made progress on the whole-school approach and there is a different mechanism for this ' et cetera . my position now is i want to just be really sure and secure that there is a strong arrangement going forward that takes this work , if this programme is going to close . suzy davies am : are you sure ? carol shillabeer : not yet . so , i think , in an earlier question i indicated dialogue going on between myself and welsh government officials . i do n't think there 's a barrier—people are n't saying , 'no , it all needs to just stop ; we 've solved the issue ' , but the exact nature of the legacy arrangements , particularly for early help and enhanced support , are not yet fully determined , or for neurodevelopmental . if it was a choice between nothing being there and continuing this programme , i would be supporting continuing the programme . i do n't think we can stop now . suzy davies am : well , i do n't think any of us would disagree with that , but i suppose there might be a level of concern that the welsh government 's preferred route from now on would be through the regional partnership boards and public services boards . you mentioned that you 've done that work in gwent , down in the south-east of your patch there . it 's quite difficult for us to try and get a picture of how that will work successfully for the whole of wales . i know you 've got your experience in gwent , but have you thought a bit more about how it might look elsewhere , if that 's the route that government decides to pursue ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think the key question in my own mind is : are the regional partnership boards yet ready and mature enough to take this forward ? i 'm the chair of the powys regional partnership board , so i should declare that . there 's a lot being asked of the regional partnership boards at the moment— suzy davies am : well , we 'll be asking them to go with the 'mind over matter ' report , to make sure that that 's delivered upon . carol shillabeer : there 's a lot , you know , ' a healthier wales'— . everyone does feel that the regional partnership boards are a route to really secure multi-agency working , so there is quite a high expectation . my understanding—and this is a rather informal understanding—is that different rpbs are in different places . so , some have retained what used to be the old children and young people partnerships , and perhaps where they have been retained , they may be in a more progressed position . some are looking to have to re-establish those . so , my sense of this is that , i think , possibly the rpbs are n't yet in that position to be ready . our piece of work on early help and enhanced support , in terms of your earlier question about what 's the commitment—that feels that that may well be another year or 18 months of development work , alongside the rpb development work , to get that ready , before we can then more confidently say where we can hand over . suzy davies am : you may not feel able to say it , then , but would be wrong in saying that , actually , it would be quite a good idea to extend the current programme , just to make sure that anyone else who might be able to run on with component parts of it is in the position to do that to our satisfaction ? carol shillabeer : i 'm happy to respond to it . my sense is that , whether it 's the programme or whether it 's something else , something needs to be there . the next stage is really multi-agency , so it may well be that the programme currently has been nhs-led—maybe it needs to be led elsewhere , maybe not . i think there 's a view that this needs to continue . i 'm less wedded to it having to be the together for children and young people programme . it may be seen as a convenient mechanism—it 's already established , we 've got a programme team et cetera , so it may be seen as a ready sort of solution . i 'm not wedded to that . what i feel strongly about is that we 've got to have the right mechanism to take it forward . suzy davies am : can i just push you on one thing there ? you mentioned , perhaps , the nhs could lead on the work , for example . is there a risk of fragmentation if we start looking— ? i 'm just thinking—i mean , we 've got the elements here : we 've got the nhs , there 's the whole-school approach , early help and enhanced support and intervention , as you mentioned earlier . if that goes to one of the players in that multi-agency approach , is there a risk that they might become too dominant , inadvertently— ? carol shillabeer : if i can just clarify—apologies if i was n't clear . i said the current programme has been nhs-led , and that might be a reason to change . suzy davies am : to mix it up a bit . oh , right , okay . anything else you want me to pursue on that— ? lynne neagle am : can i just clarify for the record , carol—because we put this to the minister last week—are you looking at asking the regional partnership boards to take this work over from october 2019 ? are you saying clearly to the committee that you do not feel that all regional partnership boards are ready for that challenge at this point ? carol shillabeer : i 'm saying that on a more , if you like it , uniformed and informal basis , we 're doing some work with the children 's commissioner now in terms of— . i know the children 's commissioner 's very interested in how rpbs are managing , developing and dealing with the issues of children and young people 's concerns . we 're working with her to understand and to mirror alongside her the understanding of the rpbs . what i would say is that there has been some preparatory work by government around supporting rpbs . so , for example , in the integrated care fund guidance last year , there was a specific reference to child and adolescent emotional mental health , which i welcomed . i 've also welcomed , literally last week , a letter to all rpb chairs giving an allocation of £200,000 per rpb to support this further work in terms of child and adolescent emotional and mental health and the early help and support element . so , all of these things are in the right direction . my sense , and i need to stress it 's a sense because we have n't done that piece of work , is different rpbs are in different places . so , how confident can we be at the october date that we could hand over ? my sense is , just to safeguard , having a mechanism in place for the next 12 to 18 months to guide this through might be advisable , and that 's what i 'm talking to officials about . lynne neagle am : and that would either be an extension of the together for children and young people programme or something else . okay , thank you . suzy davies am : thank you . because i think there is a question , is n't there , about whether the rpbs will make this enough of a priority ? i 'm a bit nervous that it might get lost in that huge amount of work you said they might have . just a final question from me : how are you establishing what the young people themselves think about the end of the programme ? are they bothered about the structure of this at all or are they just concerned that they 're getting help ? how 's the stakeholder group feeding into this ? carol shillabeer : i 've not been blown over in the rush of people saying , 'do n't go anywhere . ' [ laughter . ] it 's a really important matter for young people . i know that later on you 're meeting with the youth parliament , you 're having a joint session , which is fantastic . we 've had contact with the youth parliament because we know it 's one of their top three issues . so , it runs in the vein of that this is going to be a long-term matter for young people , i think . whether they have a specific view on the programme , i do n't know . i 've not heard that . but i 'm pretty sure they will be vocal in saying , 'we have to have these developments continue . ' it is a major issue , we 're not there yet—maybe some progress has been made but there 's still a lot to do—and i think we 'll need to be able to respond to that . suzy davies am : anything particularly you want in addition to that ? lynne neagle am : no , i think that 's fine . and if i can just say that it was really great last week at the early help and enhanced day to see young people so central to the day all the way through . it was very , very important and very welcome . suzy davies am : carol , thank you for that . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : okay . we have come to the end of our time . we had a lot of things that we wanted to cover with you . we might need to drop you a line about a couple of things that we have n't covered , but can i thank you for your attendance this morning ? as usual , you 'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting , but thank you very much for your time . carol shillabeer : thank you , all ."}

海事系统在保障重点能源物资水上运输方面有哪些工作部署?交通运输部海事局副局长、新闻发言人李宏印:谢谢您的提问!保暖保供是重大民生工程、民心工程,直接关系人民群众切身利益。水上运输是能源物资供应链的重要组成,我举一个例子,一艘船舶装载10万吨液化天然气,气化后大约有1.2亿多立方米,按照每户家庭每年600立方米使用量计算,就可供约21万户家庭使用1年。我们将保障今冬明春船舶载运煤炭、液化天然气、液化石油气水上交通安全作为近期工作的重中之重,采取有力有效措施,全力做好保安全、保通畅工作。一是密切关注冬季寒潮海冰情况,及时发布恶劣天气、海况预警预报信息,最大限度降低恶劣天气对运输生产的影响。加强与港口、引航、代理等单位沟通协调,实行7×24小时值班值守,优先安排载运煤炭、液化天然气、液化石油气船舶进出港和装卸作业。二是加强现场巡查检查,利用船舶交通管理系统、视频监控系统等技术手段,强化辖区水域交通管控和现场监管,根据需要为进出港船舶提供现场警戒或护航服务,保障港口、航道、锚地及其附近水域安全畅通。三是加强船舶安全监督管理,确保船舶适航、船员适任、货物适装。督促载运煤炭、液化天然气、液化石油气船舶及其公司加强对船舶的安全管理,严格实施船舶进出港报告和货物申报制度。四是充分考虑恶劣天气、海况对载运煤炭、液化天然气、液化石油气船舶进出港和装卸作业带来的不利影响,会同港航管理部门共同建立应急协调保障机制及相关工作预案,服务保暖保供大局。谢谢。人民网记者:“我为群众办实事”是2021年党史学习教育的重要内容,介绍一下海事系统重点开展了哪些工作?曹德胜:谢谢您的提问!应该说党史学习教育开展以来,我们按照交通运输部党组统一部署,扎实推进“我为群众办实事”的实践,对接发展所需、基层所盼、民心所向,围绕服务国家战略、保障重大工程建设、优化营商环境、助力航运发展、维护船员权益等方面,提出并扎实推进了一大批为民办实事的项目。其中,各单位党组(党委)报交通运输部党组的193项实事项目,截至目前,已顺利完成181项,完成率达到93.8%,集中解决了一批人民群众“急难愁盼”问题。2021年,交通运输部海事局党组在全系统重点组织实施5件实事,目前各实事项目2021年内已完成或取得了阶段性目标。一是实现海事证照电子化,办理结果“掌上查”。实现电子证照在线办理及发放,进一步减证便民,方便群众办事。从12月5日起,包括海船船员适任证书、海船船员培训合格证、海员外派机构资质证书、船员培训许可证等在内的13种海事电子证书证照已实现在线办理和发放。二是推行船员证书办理便捷化。我们通过一次性告知、提交和受理,促进海事政务服务进一步便民高效。11月1日起,海员证、海船船员适任证书和海船船员培训合格证,可通过“海事一网通办”平台和“船员服务一件事”栏目,合并申请、一并办理。三是推行长三角地区海船转籍登记“不停航办证”服务。海船船舶转籍有点像机动车过户。在上海、江苏、浙江三地试点推行,对因船舶所有权变动、船舶所有人住所变更或船舶航线变更需要申请海船转籍登记和转籍检验的情形,实行“不停航办证”服务,通过登记与检验“并跑申办”“分离办理”等便民措施,减环节、减材料、减时限,大幅提升船舶跨区域登记效率,持续优化航运营商环境。根据试点情况我们还将适时向全国进行推广。四是推动船舶审核全国通办当天发证。优化船舶审核发证工作机制,从10月1日起正式实行船舶安全管理体系审核全国通办,发证时间压缩为1个工作日,这项实事的实施,有效减少了船舶滞港待审时间,提高了船舶周转效率,预计平均每年可为国内船东节省成本数亿元。目前的航运市场形势比较好,如果船舶滞港,一天的成本就是数十万元。五是实行海事政务办理告知承诺制。进一步“减证便民”,深化海事“证照分离”改革,公民、法人和其他组织在申请办理海事政务服务事项时,可以通过提交海事证明事项告知承诺书替代部分申请材料或者免于原件审核,目前30余项海事业务共计60余项材料已经适用告知承诺制。下一步,我们将继续深化办实事工作,在现在的工作基础上,持续优化各项便民措施,让群众有更多的获得感。谢谢!南方都市报记者:基层是抓落实的“最后一公里”,基层队伍也是基层建设的主力军。我们想请问基层海事管理机构在加强一线监管和服务方面有哪些探索,下一步有哪些打算?天津北疆海事局局长丰磊:谢谢您的提问!我来自天津北疆海事局,辖区位于天津自贸港区,年船舶进出港4万余艘次,集装箱吞吐量约1700万标箱,是天津港践行习近平总书记提出的“建设世界一流智慧、绿色港口”的前沿阵地。我们海事管理既是“最前线”,也是落实海事队伍“四化”建设的“最后一公里”。我想通过分享几个案例来介绍一下我们在一线监管和服务中的努力和探索。首先,在依法履职保安全方面,我们始终瞄准辖区安全管理的痛点和难点,创新工作方法,严守安全底线。比如,针对环渤海内支线集装箱船航程短、周转快的现状,创新实施津冀内贸集装箱船舶联动执法,建立了船舶风险分级管控、联合检查、联合惩戒等机制,实现了信息互换、监管互认、执法互助的津冀海事船舶监管“一体化”的新模式,有效保障了水上交通安全,助力构建环渤海支线集装箱水路运输安全、绿色“通道”,服务经济内循环。仅天津港去年环渤海支线箱量增幅就达到了67%,突破一百万标箱。还有针对北疆辖区集装箱船舶流量大、时间短的特点,我们通过探索运用岸基固定式遥测站和船舶、无人机搭载嗅探设备的方式,构建了“陆海空天”一体化船舶大气污染防治监管的新模式,助力绿色港口建设。其次,在执政为民办实事方面,我们始终聚焦民生关切、行业发展和国家战略,不断优化海事“互联网+政务”的工作机制,探索让群众少跑腿、让信息多跑路的路径,率先开通“海事+航保”一体化融合发展示范窗口,通过“预约办、并联办、一次办”等举措,实现跨部门一站式服务,大幅缩短政务办理时间,年均政务办理10万余件,连续三年实现“零差错”“零投诉”。此外,在服务天津港c段智能化集装箱码头项目上,探索监管与服务相融合,开展“一项目一方案、一项目一团队、一项目一措施”的点对点、订单式监管服务,有效保障了该工程安全、快速投产运营,兑现了服务零距离的承诺,也得到了社会各界的充分肯定。海事队伍“四化”建设刚刚启动,还有很多工作需要我们去探索和实践。作为最基层的海事部门,北疆海事局在接下来的工作中,将找准着力点、盯紧突破点、瞄准发力点,全面打通高效监管、优质服务的“最后一公里”,率先打造海事队伍“四化”建设基层示范基地,以实际行动服务推进海事高质量发展。谢谢!央广网记者:当前,全球新冠肺炎疫情比较严重,国内疫情防控任务也比较艰巨,我们知道保障国内国际物流供应链稳定十分重要,请介绍一下海事部门在疫情防控方面的工作情况。李宏印:谢谢您的提问!水上交通运输承载着我国90%以上外贸货运量和40%以上内贸货运量,在促进贸易复苏、保持国内国际物流供应链稳定方面发挥着十分积极的作用。自疫情暴发以来,海事部门全面部署做好防疫情、保畅通、保安全的各项工作。一是编印《船舶船员新冠肺炎疫情防控操作指南》,指导行业强化疫情防控措施,目前该指南已更新至第八版,并通过国际海事组织向全球分享。二是落实交通运输行业“一断三不断”疫情防控要求,建立重点物资水路运输“绿色通道”,保障国内国际物流供应链畅通和群众生活稳定。三是紧密围绕海事职责,切实加强与当地海关、边检、卫健等部门的信息共享和协同联动,筑牢疫情防控防线。四是充分利用国际贸易“单一窗口”等手段实施信息互通,协同有关部门做好水运口岸外防输入工作。五是会同海关总署、国家移民管理局先后6次启动熔断机制,累计暂停39家航运企业的1069艘船舶在我国境内港口更换外籍船员。六是落实减税降费政策,通过对港口建设费和船舶油污损害赔偿基金减免征事项作出部署,进一步减轻疫情形势下航运企业的税费负担,助力航运市场持续健康发展。船员是保障航运稳定运转的关键力量。疫情发生后,他们的工作环境和生活环境都发生了很大变化,他们为此付出了巨大的努力和牺牲。我们十分重视船员权益保障工作,会同相关部门积极推动船员换班、伤病救助等工作,提出了便利船员办理业务的服务举措,最大限度消除疫情对船员带来的不利影响。自2020年4月至2021年11月底,在各相关方面的共同努力下,全国船员疫苗接种率近九成,全国累计完成国际航行船舶船员换班32.5万余人次,救助伤病船员1800余人次。针对当前境外疫情防控形势,近日国务院联防联控机制印发了《关于加强口岸城市新冠肺炎疫情防控工作的通知》,明确“对船舶上发现的核酸检测阳性人员,各口岸城市要按规定接收并及时转运至定点医疗机构,未转运或未实施终末消毒前,不得采取登轮作业的方式装卸货物”。海事部门将密切与各相关部门的沟通协作,认真抓好贯彻落实,切实保障好船员的合法权益。根据疫情以来相关工作情况,我们也积极开展调查研究和意见收集工作,对于做好船舶船员远端防控和境内船员换班,提出优化国际航行船舶船员疫情防控工作建议。近期国务院联防联控机制综合组将印发文件,对进一步做好国际航行船舶船员疫情防控工作作出专门部署,我们将认真贯彻落实,协同各方全力做好船员换班和伤病救助工作。谢谢!中国交通报记者:2021年8月,交通运输部联合农业农村部启动了“商渔共治2021”专项行动,请介绍一下专项行动的有关情况。李宏印:谢谢您的提问!近年来,我国沿海水域商渔船碰撞重大事故时有发生,为防范化解商渔船碰撞风险,切实保障人民群众生命和财产安全,在2021年8月1日至11月30日期间,交通运输部与农业农村部在已有商渔船安全工作会商机制的基础上,联合组织实施了“商渔共治2021”行动。专项行动可以归纳为两大方面。一是联合宣教,各级海事、渔业部门以商渔船防碰撞专题培训、渔业船员全覆盖警示教育、商船船长“面对面”活动、《中国沿海航行船舶防范商渔船碰撞安全指引》推广为重点开展联合宣教,目的是增进商船船员与渔船船员之间的相互了解、相互理解,提高船员安全意识和防碰撞技术能力。二是联合执法,以碍航养殖、不正确显示号灯号型、人证不符、配员不足、导航通信设备不足等为查处重点开展联合执法,全力防范化解商渔船碰撞风险。在为期4个月的专项行动中,海事部门累计开展商渔船警示教育活动7100余场,覆盖9.2万人次;播发商渔船防碰撞安全信息近280万条,覆盖船舶224.4万艘次,发放《中国沿海航行船舶防范商渔船碰撞安全指引》13万余份;累计开展巡航检查3700余次,排查进出港航路、商渔船密集区域2100余次,查处违反定线制、碍航养殖、不正确显示信号灯等违法船舶3200余艘次。从当前商渔船碰撞事故统计数据来看,专项行动取得了一定成效。8月1日至11月30日,全国共发生一般等级以上商渔船碰撞事故9起,造成死亡失踪21人,较2020年同期分别下降59%、72.7%,未发生重大等级以上商渔船碰撞事故。下一步,我们将深入总结分析、梳理典型经验、查找短板弱项,进一步加强商渔船防碰撞工作,坚决遏制重大事故发生,切实保障人民群众生命财产安全。谢谢!红星新闻记者:我的问题是,在第二届联合国全球可持续交通大会主旨讲话中,习近平主席提出要践行共商共建共享的全球治理观。海事部门具有很强的涉外性,请介绍一下,我国在海事领域的国际交流合作中开展了哪些工作?曹德胜:谢谢您的提问!非常感谢大家对海事国际事务的关心。各位记者朋友可能已经注意到,在上周五,也就是12月10日,国际海事组织第32届大会在英国伦敦举行了新一届理事会选举,我国再次顺利当选a类理事国,充分彰显了我国的大国形象。一直以来,我们十分重视提升我国在海事领域的国际影响力和话语权,借此机会介绍以下几方面工作。一是强化制度建设,完善国际合作顶层设计。我们印发《关于推动海事国际合作发展的指导意见》等文件,为整个海事系统国际合作的发展设定了战略目标和合作方向,推动我国向国际海事组织提交提案的数量和质量“双提升”,党的十八大以来,共提交提案550余份,位列国际海事组织成员国的首位,有效提升了中国海事影响力。二是落实“一带一路”倡议,服务国家战略实施和外交大局。我们致力于扩大国际合作与交流,党的十八大以来,先后与丹麦、新加坡、巴拿马、希腊、意大利、约旦、泰国、卢森堡、蒙古、利比里亚海事主管机关签署了海事领域的合作文件,目前我们已经与27个国家和地区实现了海船船员适任证书的认可。这27个国家和地区包括了主要的航运国家。大家知道,我们过去海船的船员证书在国际上是不被认可的,通过我们持续的工作,我们国家的船员拿到证书是可以在27个国家,也可以说在世界上可以自由任职。为包括东盟地区国家在内的“一带一路”沿线国家海事主管机关实施能力建设,开展务实互利合作,中国海事的“国际朋友圈”不断扩大。这几年我们为东盟相关国家培训的项目实施非常好,得到了东盟国家的一致认可。三是注重人才培养,提升国际影响力。通过每年举办海事国际合作和履约培训、公派培训和留学等方式,培养海事国际合作人才。海事系统先后共有18人次担任国际海事组织分委会主席、工作组和通信组协调人,4人担任国际海事组织专项工作审核官员,3人成功竞聘国际海事组织秘书处高级技术官,8人代表东京备忘录组织对其他港口国检查和备忘录组织授课当老师,具有一定国际影响力的人才不断涌现。四是强化“三基”建设,提升履约能力。聚焦基层基础基本功,打造“政产学研用”一体的国际海事研究平台,激发了海事国际研究活力,2021年共向国际海事组织提交了121份提案,是历年最高。同时,做好迎接国际海事组织成员国强制审核各项工作,国际海事组织有一个审核机制,对成员国每4年进行一次强制性审核,看国家对国际履约、国际海事组织的规章执行是否符合要求。我们对照国际海事组织审核所涉及的900余条政府义务条款进行逐条梳理和改进完善,不断提升履约水平和能力。下一步,我们将秉持共商共建共享的全球治理观,坚定不移加快建设交通强国,为全球海事治理体系建设和构建全球交通命运共同体贡献中国海事力量。谢谢!中国航务周刊记者:2021年9月,交通运输部启动了小型船舶检验及其监督管理优化试点工作。请介绍一下目前这项工作的推进情况。李宏印:谢谢您的提问!小型船舶,指的是国内航行的小于500总吨的船舶和船长小于12米的国内海洋和内河渔船。大家都知道,我们国家小型船舶在国内航行船舶中占据了较大比例,并且不少是群众的自用船、生计船,与百姓生活密切相关。以造船大省江苏省为例,截至2021年11月底,江苏省500总吨以下船舶30143艘,占比约75%;300总吨以下船舶22251艘,占比约55%。数量众多的小型船舶在结构和应用场景上均与大型船舶有着显著区别,建立一套更加符合小型船舶特点的检验机制,为群众提供更加高效便捷的船舶检验服务,正是船东、船民和船舶检验机构的所需所盼。2021年9月,针对300总吨以下的国内航行船舶和船长小于12米的内河渔船,交通运输部启动了小型船舶检验及其监督管理试点优化,坚持“安全是底线”“便民是目标”“诚信是基础”“分类分级是措施”四个原则,从实现船舶检验分类管理,优化小型船舶检验制度,降低群众经济成本,提高现有船舶检验资源利用率,提高船舶检验服务质量的角度出发,首批在10个省(区、市)的13家单位中开展了试点工作,试点时间从2021年9月1日到2022年8月31日。为有效推进试点工作,我们推出了船舶质量诚信机制、适检评估制度、批量建造船舶便利发证机制、营运中的船舶免检机制、集中检验机制、加强检验机制、船舶自检和安全承诺声明制度、营运船舶检验替代机制和检验人员补充机制共9项改革创新举措。当前,各试点单位相继启动了试点船舶情况摸排及试点船舶清单上报、首艘船或首批船的检验试点等工作。9月10日,江苏省船舶检验机构成功发放了全国首张小型船舶试点检验证书。目前,全国已有约3400艘船舶列入了试点船舶清单,同时还有9家单位申请参加第二批试点工作。下一步,我们将继续推动试点工作深入开展,及时总结试点工作经验,优化完善试点制度,并适时扩大覆盖范围和在全国推广。谢谢!刘鹏飞:由于时间关系,我们今天的发布会到此结束。非常感谢大家的参与,谢谢大家,再见。"}

phd a : but i did n't do that because i was not sure about security problems . i i would have to phd e : so w when you came in from belgian { comment } belgium , using ssh , uh , was it asking you for your own password into icsi ? so if yo you can only do that if you have an account at icsi ? phd a : right . yeah . yeah . phd e : cuz there is an a way to set up anonymous cvs right ? phd a : yeah , you ha in this way you ca you have to set up a cvs server but then , yeah , you can access it . phd e : so that oh , ok . phd a : you you can set up priorities . phd e : so the anonymous mechanism phd a : you can access them and mostly if you if y the set the server is set up like this . phd e : ok . because a lot of the open source stuff works with anonymous cvs and i 'm just wondering uh , i mean , for our transcripts we may want to do that . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : yeah . yeah , for this stuff i do n't think we 're quite up to that . i mean , we 're still so much in development . phd e : mm - hmm . yeah , professor b : we want to have just the insiders . phd e : yeah , yeah . oh , i was n't suggesting for this . i 'm thinking of the meeting recorder { comment } stuff professor b : yeah . phd e : but . yeah . ok . cool . professor b : yeah . so , uh phd e : what 's new ? professor b : well , i mean , i think maybe the thing to me might be i me i 'm sure you 've just been working on on , uh , details of that since the meeting , right ? and so phd a : mmm , since the meeting , well , i i 've been i 've been train training a new vad and a new feature net . professor b : that was that was tuesday . ok . phd a : so they should be ready . um . professor b : but i guess maybe the thing since you were n't yo you guys were n't at that that meeting , might be just just to , um , sort of recap , uh , the the conclusions of the meeting . phd a : mm - hmm . phd e : oh , great . you 're talking about the meeting with hynek ? professor b : yeah . cuz that was sort of , uh we we 'd sort of been working up to that , that that , uh , he would come here this week and and we would sort of phd e : uh - huh . professor b : since he 's going out of town like now , and i 'm going out town in a couple weeks , uh , and time is marching , sort of , given all the mu many wonderful things we could be working on , what what will we actually focus on ? phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : and , uh and what do we freeze ? and , you know , what do we ? so , um . i mean , this software that these guys created was certainly a a key part . so then there 's something central and there are n't at least a bunch of different versions going off in in ways that differ trivially . uh , um , and , um , phd e : yeah . that 's that 's nice . professor b : and then within that , i guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now , to run it , uh , a particular way , and decide on what things are gon na be experimented with , as opposed to just experimenting with everything . so keep a certain set of things constant . so , um . uh , maybe describe roughly what what we are keeping constant for now , or ? phd a : yeah . well . so we 've been working like six weeks on on the noise compensation and we end up with something that seems reasonable . um . phd e : are you gon na use which of the two techniques ? phd a : so finally it 's it 's , um , wiener filtering on fft bins . and it uses , uh , two steps , smoothing of the transfer function , the first step , that 's along time , which use recursion . and after this step there is a further smoothing along frequency , which use a sliding window of twenty fft bins . mmm . and , uh phd e : so this is on the uh , before any mel scaling has been done ? phd a : yeah , yeah . phd e : this is phd a : it was professor b : this this smoothing is done on the estimate , um , of what you 're going to subtract ? or on the thing that has already had something subtracted ? phd a : yeah . uh , it 's on the transfer function . so professor b : oh , it 's on the transfer function for the wiener filter . phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah , ok . phd a : yeah , so basically we tried different configuration within this idea . we tried u u applying this on mel bands , having spectral subtraction instead of wiener filtering . um . well , finally we end up with this configuration that works , uh , quite well . so we are going to fix this for the moment and work on the other aspects of the whole system . phd e : mm - hmm . phd a : so professor b : actually , let me int eh , dave is n't here to talk about it , but let me just interject . this module , in principle , i i mean , you would know whether it 's true in fact , is somewhat independent from the rest of it . i mean , because you you re - synthesize speech , right ? phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : so , um . uh , well you do n't i guess you do n't re - synthesize speech , but you could phd a : we we do not fo professor b : uh , but you could . phd a : well well , we do , but we do n't do n't re - synthesize . in in the program we do n't re - synthesize and then re - analyze once again . we just use the clean fft bins . professor b : but you have a re - synthesized thing that you that 's an an option here . phd a : this is an option that then you can yeah . professor b : yeah , i gu i guess my point is that , um , i in some of the work he 's doing in reverberation , one of the things that we 're finding is that , uh , it 's it 's for the for an artificial situation , we can just deal with the reverberation and his techniques work really well . but for the real situation uh , problem is , is that you do n't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise . and if you do n't include that in the model , it does n't work very well . so in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at . and , uh , generate new files or whatever , and and , uh , uh and then do the reverberation part . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : so it 's anyway . phd e : so dave has n't tried that yet ? professor b : no , no . he 's i mean , e phd e : i guess he 's busy with professor b : yeah , prelims , right . grad c : pre - prelim hell . professor b : yeah . phd e : yeah . yeah . professor b : uh , but but , you know , that 'll uh , it 's clear that we , uh we are not with the real case that we 're looking at , we ca n't just look at reverberation in isolation because the interaction between that and noise is is considerable . and that 's i mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and and , uh and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and and additive effects . and that 's hard enough . i mean , i do n't think we really i mean , we 're trying to deal with that . in a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this aurora task . and we have , uh , the , uh , uh , lda stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects . and we have the noise suppression that 's doing something about noise . uh , even that 's hard enough . and and the on - line normalization as well , in that s category . i i there 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work so hard on on juggling everything around . but now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse , because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects . and , um , so dave has something which , uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects but when it 's when there 's noise there too , it 's it 's it 's pretty hard . so we have to start since any almost any real situation is gon na have uh , where you have the microphone distant , is going to have both things , we we actually have to think about both at the same time . so , um so there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out and then , uh , maybe you should just continue telling what what else is in the the form we have . phd a : yeah , well , the , um , the other parts of the system are the the blocks that were already present before and that we did not modify a lot . professor b : so that 's again , that that 's the wiener filtering , followed by , uh uh , that 's done at the fft level . then phd a : yeah , th then the mel filter bank , professor b : mm - hmm . phd a : then the log operation , professor b : mm - hmm . the the the filtering is done in the frequency domain ? phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah , ok . and then the mel and then the log , and then the phd a : then the lda filter , professor b : lda filter . phd a : mmm , then the downsampling , professor b : and then uh downsample , phd a : then , um , on - line normalization , professor b : on - line norm , phd a : followed by upsampling . then finally , we compute delta and we put the neural network also . professor b : right , and then in parallel with an a neural net . and then following neural net , some probably some orthogonalization . phd a : yeah . professor b : uh um . phd a : and finally frame dropping , which um , would be a neural network also , used for estimated silence probabilities . and the input of this neural network would be somewhere between log mel bands or one of the earlier stages of the processing . professor b : mm - hmm . so that 's sort of most of this stuff is yeah , is operating parallel with this other stuff . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : yeah . so the things that we , um , uh , i guess we sort of uh , there 's there 's some , uh , neat ideas for v a so , i mean , in i think there 's sort of like there 's a bunch of tuning things to improve stuff . there 's questions about various places where there 's an exponent , if it 's the right exponent , or ways that we 're estimating noise , that we can improve estimating noise . and there 's gon na be a host of those . but structurally it seemed like the things the main things that that we brought up that , uh , are are gon na need to get worked on seriously are , uh , uh , a a significantly better vad , uh , putting the neural net on , um , which , you know , we have n't been doing anything with , the , uh , neural net at the end there , and , uh , the , uh , opening up the second front . uh . phd e : the other half of the channel ? professor b : yeah , yeah , i mean , cuz we we have we have , uh , uh , half the the , uh , data rate that they allow . phd e : that what you mean ? professor b : and , uh , so the initial thing which came from , uh , the meeting that we had down south was , uh , that , um , we 'll initially just put in a mel spectrum as the second one . it 's , you know , cheap , easy . uh . there 's a question about exactly how we do it . we probably will go to something better later , but the initial thing is that cepstra and spectra behave differently , phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : so . um , { comment } i think tony robinson used to do i was saying this before . i think he used to do mel , uh , spectra and mel cepstra . he used them as alternate features . put them together . phd e : so if you took the system the way it is now , the way it 's fro you 're gon na freeze it , and it ran it on the last evaluation , where it would it be ? phd a : mm - hmm . it , uh , phd e : in terms of ranking ? phd a : ri - right now it 's second . phd d : second . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : although you you know , you have n't tested it actually on the german and danish , have you ? phd a : no , we did n't . no , um . professor b : yeah . phd e : so on the ones that you did test it on it would have been second ? professor b : yeah . would it i mean but when you 're saying second , you 're comparing to the numbers that the , uh that the best system before got on , uh also without german and danish ? phd a : yeah , yeah . professor b : yeah , ok . phd d : and th the ranking actually did n't change after the german and danish . so , yeah . professor b : well ranking did n't before , but i 'm just asking where this is to where theirs was without the german and danish , phd a : yeah . phd d : yeah . yeah . professor b : right ? phd d : yeah , yeah . phd e : where where where were we actually on the last test ? professor b : oh , we were also esp essentially second , although there were there were i mean , we had a couple systems and they had a couple systems . and so , i guess by that we were third , but i mean , there were two systems that were pretty close , that came from the same place . phd e : uh - huh . i see . ok . professor b : uh , so institutionally we were we were second , with , uh , the third third system . phd e : we 're so this second that you 're saying now is system - wide second ? professor b : see uh , no i think it 's also institutional , is n't it ? phd e : still institutionally second ? professor b : right ? i mean , i think both of their systems probably phd a : uh , we are between their two systems . so professor b : oh , are we ? phd a : i it is a triumph . phd d : yeah . professor b : is it ? phd d : their their first system is fifty - four point something . and , uh , we are fifty - three point something . phd a : but everything is within the range of one one percent . phd d : and their second system is also fifty - three point something . yeah , one percent . professor b : yeah , so so basically they 're all they 're all pretty close . phd e : oh , wow ! that 's very close . phd d : yeah . phd e : yeah . professor b : and and , um , you know , in some sense we 're all doing fairly similar things . uh , i mean , one could argue about the lda and so forth but i i think , you know , in a lot of ways we 're doing very similar things . but what what phd e : so how did they fill up this all these these bits ? i mean , if we 're u professor b : um , why are we using half ? well , so you could you c phd e : yeah . or how are they using more than half , i guess maybe is what i professor b : yeah , so i i think uh , you guys are closer to it than me , so correct me if i 'm wrong , but i i think that what 's going on is that in in both cases , some kind of normalization is done to deal with convola convolutional effects . uh , they have some cepstral modification , phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : right ? in our case we have a couple things . we have the on - line normalization and then we have the lda rasta . and they seem to comple complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us . but in any event , they 're both doing the same sort of thing . but there 's one difference . the lda rasta , uh , throws away high modulation frequencies . and they 're not doing that . phd e : so th so professor b : so that if you throw away high modulation frequencies , then you can downsample . grad c : get down . phd e : i see . i see . professor b : so phd e : so what if you did n't so do you explicitly downsample then ? do we explicitly downsample ? professor b : yeah . phd a : yeah . phd e : and what if we did n't do that ? would we get worse performance ? phd a : um yeah , not better , not worse . professor b : i think it does n't affect it , does it ? phd e : i see . ok . professor b : yeah . so i think the thing is , since we 're not evidently throwing away useful information , let 's try to put in some useful information . phd e : yeah . yeah . professor b : and , uh , so i you know , we we 've found in a lot of ways for quite a while that having a second stream uh , helps a lot . so that 's that 's put in , and you know , it may even end up with mel spectrum even though i 'm saying i think we could do much better , just because it 's simple . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : um . and you know , in the long run having something everybody will look at and say , `` oh , yeah , i understand `` , is is very helpful . phd e : so you would you 're you 're thinking to put the , uh , mel spectrum in before any of the noise removal stuff ? or after ? professor b : well , that 's a question . i mean , we were talking about that . it looks like it 'd be straightforward to to , uh , remove the noise , um , and , uh , phd e : cuz that happens before the mel conversion , right ? professor b : yeah . so , i mean , to do it after the mel conversion uh , after the noise removal , after the mel conversion . there 's even a question in my mind anyhow of whether th you should take the log or not . uh . i sort of think you should , but i do n't know . phd a : what about norm normalizing also ? professor b : right . uh . well , but normalizing spectra instead of cepstra ? phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah , probably . some kind would be good . you know ? i would think . phd d : well , it it it it so it actually makes it dependent on the overall energy of the uh , the frame . professor b : if you do or do n't normalize ? phd d : if yo if you do n't normalize and if if you do n't normalize . professor b : right . yes , so i mean , one would think that you would want to normalize . but i i w w my thought is , uh , particularly if you take the log , try it . and then if if normalization helps , then y you have something to compare against , and say , `` ok , this much effect `` i mean , you do n't want to change six things and then see what happens . you want to change them one at a time . phd d : mm - hmm . professor b : so adding this other stream in , that 's simple in some way . and then saying , oh uh particularly because we 've found in the past there 's all these these these different results you get with slight modifications of how you do normalization . normalization 's a very tricky , sensitive thing and you learn a lot . so , i would think you would wan na have some baseline that says , `` ok , we do n't normalize , this is what we get `` , when we do this normalization , when we do that normalization . but but the other question is so i think ultimately we 'll wind up doing some normalization . i agree . phd e : so this second stream , will it add latency to the system professor b : no , it 's in parallel . phd e : or ? professor b : we 're not talking about computation time here . we 're ta i think we 're pretty far out . phd e : yeah . professor b : so it 's just in terms of what data it 's depending on . it 's depending on the same data as the other . phd e : same data . professor b : so it 's in parallel . uh - huh . grad c : so with this , uh , new stream would you train up a vad on both both features , somehow ? phd d : no , i guess the vad has its own set of features . grad c : ok . that 's phd d : i mean , which could be this one of these streams , or it can be something derived from these streams . professor b : yeah . phd a : and there is also the idea of using traps , maybe , for the vad , which , um phd d : yeah , that 's also phd a : well , pratibha apparently showed , when , she was at ibm , that it 's a good idea . so . grad c : would would that fit on the handset , or ? oh ! phd a : i have no idea . phd d : well , it has t i mean the th phd a : it would have to fit but yeah . phd d : yeah , if it has to fit the delays and all this stuff . professor b : well , there 's the delays and the storage , yeah . but i do n't think the storage is so big for that . grad c : right . phd d : yeah . professor b : i think th the biggest we 've run into for storage is the neural net . right ? phd d : yeah . professor b : yeah . um . and so i guess the issue there is , are we are we using neural - net - based traps , and and how big are they ? so that 'll that 'll be , you know , an issue . grad c : oh , right . professor b : maybe they can be little ones . grad c : yeah . cuz sh right . professor b : mini - traps . grad c : cuz she also does the , uh the correlation - based , uh , traps , with without the neural net , just looking at the correlation between professor b : right . and maybe for vad they would be ok . yeah . yeah . grad c : yeah . professor b : that 's true . phd d : yeah . professor b : or a simple neural net , right ? i mean , the thing is , if you 're doing correlation , you 're just doing a simple uh , uh uh , dot product , you know , with some weights which you happened to learn from this learn from the data . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : and so , uh , putting a nonlinearity on it is , you know , not that big a deal . it certainly does n't take much space . grad c : mm - hmm . right . professor b : so , uh , the question is , how complex a function do you need ? do you need to have an added layer or something ? in which case , uh , potentially , you know , it could be big . so . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so , uh , uh so what 's next ? maybe s s remind us . phd e : so the meeting with hynek that you guys just had was to decide exactly what you were gon na freeze in this system ? is that ? or was there ? were you talking about what t new stuff , or ? professor b : what to freeze and then what to do after we froze . yeah . and like i was saying , i think the you know , the basic directions are , uh , uh i mean , there 's lots of little things , such as improve the noise estimator but the bigger things are adding on the neural net and , uh , the second stream . and then , uh , improving the vad . uh . so . phd d : so , i 'll , um i 'll actually after the meeting i 'll add the second stream to the vad and maybe i 'll start with the feature net in that case . it 's like , you 're looking at the vad , right ? phd a : uh , yeah . i i 've a new feature net ready also . phd d : i 'll for the vad ? phd a : no , uh . well p two network , one vad and one feature net . phd d : oh , you already have it ? phd a : mm - hmm . phd d : ok , so just figure how to take the features from the final phd a : yeah . um . but , yeah , i think there are plenty of issues to work on for the feature net @ @ . grad c : feature net . phd e : what about the , um uh , the new part of the evaluation , the , uh , wall street journal part ? professor b : right . right . um . have you ever ? very good question . have you ever worked with the mississippi state h uh , software ? phd a : sorry . phd e : no . not yet . professor b : oh . well you you may be called upon to help , uh , uh , on account of , uh , all the work in this stuff here has been , uh , with small vocabulary . phd e : ok . mm - hmm . so what how is the , uh , interaction supposed to happen ? uh , i remember the last time we talked about this , it was sort of up in the air whether they were going to be taking , uh , people 's features and then running them or they were gon na give the system out or phd d : yeah . yeah . phd e : oh , so they 're gon na just deliver a system basically . phd d : yeah , yeah . professor b : do we already have it ? phd d : yeah , th i i guess it 's almost ready . phd e : uh - huh . phd d : so that 's what so they have released their , uh , document , describing the system . professor b : maybe you could , uh , point it at chuck , phd e : i see . professor b : because , i mean phd d : sure . phd e : so we 'll have to grab this over cvs or something ? phd d : it - no , it 's just downloadable from their from their web site . phd e : is that how they do it ? ok . professor b : cuz one of the things that might be helpful , if you 've if you 've got time in all of this is , is if if these guys are really focusing on improving , uh , all the digit stuff , uh , maybe and you got the front - end from them , maybe you could do the runs for the phd e : ok . mm - hmm . professor b : and and , you know , iron out hassles that that you have to , uh , tweak joe about or whatever , phd e : sure . professor b : because you 're more experienced with running the large vocabulary stuff . phd d : so i 'll point you to the web site and the mails corresponding . so i phd e : and it but it 's not ready yet , the system ? phd d : uh , i i think they are still , uh , tuning something on that . so they 're like , d they 're varying different parameters like the insertion penalty and other stuff , and then seeing what 's the performance . phd e : are those going to be parameters that are frozen , nobody can change ? or ? phd d : uh , w i guess there is , uh , time during which people are gon na make suggestions . phd e : oh , but everybody 's gon na have to use the same values . phd d : after that . phd e : oh ! interesting . phd d : yeah , i guess . so these sugges these this , uh , period during which people are gon na make suggestions is to know whether it is actually biased towards any set of features or professor b : yeah , so i th th certainly the thing that i would want to know about is whether we get really hurt , uh , on in insertion penalty , language model , scaling , sorts of things . phd e : using our features . professor b : yeah , yeah . phd e : yeah . professor b : uh , in which case , um , h hari or hynek will need to , you know , push the case more about about this . phd e : mm - hmm . and we may be able to revisit this idea about , you know , somehow modifying our features to work with professor b : yes . in this case , that 's right . phd e : yeah . professor b : that 's right . um , some of that may be , uh , a last minute rush thing because if the if our features are changing uh . phd e : yeah . professor b : uh . but , um . yeah , the other thing is that even though it 's months away , uh , it 's starting to seem to me now like november fifteenth is right around the corner . and , um , if they have n't decided things like this , like what the parameters are gon na be for this , uh , when `` deciding `` is not just somebody deciding . i mean , in fact there should be some understanding behind the , uh , deciding , which means some experiments and and so forth . it it it seems pretty tight to me . phd e : so wha what 's the significance of november fifteenth ? professor b : that 's when the evaluation is . yeah . so , yeah , so after but , you know , they may even decide in the end to push it off . it would n't , you know , entirely surprise me . but , uh , due to other reasons , like some people are going away , i 'm i 'm hoping it 's not pushed off for a l a long while . that would be , uh put us in an awkward position . but anyway . great . yeah , i think that 'll be helpful . there 's there 's not anybody ogi currently who 's who 's , uh , working with this and and phd e : is is this part of the evaluation just a small part , or ho how important is this to the overall ? professor b : i i think it 's it 's , um it depends how badly you do . i mean , i think that it it is uh . phd e : this is one of those things that will be debated afterwards ? professor b : yeah . well , i mean , it 's it 's conceptually , it my impression , again , you guys correct me if i 'm wrong , but my impression is that , um , they want it as a double check . that you have n't come across you have n't invented features which are actually gon na do badly for a a significantly different task , particularly one with larger vocabulary . and , um , but it 's not the main emphasis . i mean , the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary . so it 's it 's a double check . so they 'll probably assign it some sort of low weight . phd e : seems to me that if it 's a double check , they should give you a one or a zero . y you passed the threshold or you did n't pass the threshold , and they should n't even care about what the score is . professor b : yeah . but , i mean , we 'll we 'll we 'll see what they come up with . uh , but in in the current thing , for instance , where you have this well - matched , moderately - matched , and and mis highly - mismatched , uh , the emphasis is somewhat on the on the well - matched , but it 's only a a marginal , phd e : yeah . professor b : right ? it 's like forty , thirty - five , twenty - five , or something like that . so you still if you were way , way off on the highly - mismatched , it would have a big effect . phd d : yeah . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : and , um , it would n't surprise me if they did something like that with this . so again , if you 're if you get if it does n't help you much , uh , for noisy versions of this of large vocabulary data , then , uh , you know , it may not hurt you that much . but if it if you do n't if it does n't help you much at all , um , or to put it another way , if it helps some people a lot more than it helps other people , uh , if their strategies do , then phd e : mm - hmm . so is this , uh ? uh , guenter was putting a bunch of wall street journal data on our disks . professor b : that 's it . phd e : so that 's the data that we 'll be running on ? professor b : yeah . phd e : i see . ok . professor b : yeah . so we have the data , just not the recognizer . ok . phd e : so this test may take quite a while to run , then . may - judging by the amount of data that he was putting on . professor b : uh , well there 's training and test , right ? phd e : i i guess , i 'm not sure . professor b : no , i mean , if it 's like the other things , there 's there 's data for training the h m ms and and data for testing it . phd e : i just professor b : so i would n't so it it 's phd e : ok . so there 's professor b : so , training the recognizer , but , um um . but i think it 's trained on clean and is it trained on clean and and test on ? phd d : the wall street ? professor b : yeah . phd a : apparently , no . it 's training on a range between ten and twenty db , i think , and testing between five and fifteen . phd d : mm - hmm . yeah . phd a : that 's what i got on phd d : it 's , uh it 's like a medium medium - mismatch condition , sort of . phd a : yeah , professor b : i see . phd a : and so the noise is there is a range of different noises also um which are selected randomly and added randomly , uh , to the files . and there are noises that are different from the noises used on ti - digits . professor b : yeah . yeah . i mean , i would n't imagine that the amount of testing data was that huge . they probably put training uh , almost certain they put training data there too . maybe not . so . that 's that . anybody have anything else ? phd e : uh , one one last question on that . when did they estimate that they would have that system available for download ? phd d : um , i guess i guess one some preliminary version is already there . phd e : oh , so there 's w something you can download to just learn ? phd d : yeah , it 's already there . yeah . but they 're actually parallel - y doing some modifications also , i think . phd e : good . phd d : so i guess the f final system will be frozen by middle of , like , one more week maybe . professor b : oh , well that 's pretty soon . phd d : yeah , that 's just one more . grad c : is this their , um , svm recognizer ? phd d : no , it 's just a straightforward hmm . professor b : you know , their their they have a lot of options in their recognizer and and the svm is one of the things they 've done with it , but it 's not their more standard thing . grad c : oh , ok . uh - huh . professor b : for the most part it 's it 's gaussian mixtures . grad c : oh , ok . oh , ok . professor b : yeah . phd d : it 's just a hmm , gaussian mixture model . grad c : gaussian mixture hmm . professor b : yeah . yeah , the svm thing was an hmm also . it was just a it it it was like a hybrid , like grad c : mm - hmm . phd d : yeah , this is a g yeah , this i professor b : what ? phd d : yeah . professor b : yeah . phd e : so , just so that i understand , they 're providing scripts and everything so that basically , uh , you you push a button and it does training , and then it does test , and everything ? is that the idea ? phd d : i i i think yeah , i i guess something like that . it 's like as painless as possible , phd e : mm - hmm . phd d : is what do they provide all the scripts , everything , and then just , phd e : i see . hmm . somehow yo there 's hooks to put your features in and phd d : ju yeah , i th i think . professor b : hmm . yeah , um . in fact , i mean , if you look into it a little bit , it might be reasonable you know joe , right ? yeah . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : just to sort of ask him about the issue of , um , different features having different kinds of , uh , scaling characteristics and so on . so that , you know , w w possibly having entirely different optimal values for for the usual twiddle factors and what 's what 's the plan about that ? phd d : so sh shall we , like , add chuck also to the mailing lists ? it may be better , i mean , in that case if he 's going to professor b : yeah . phd d : because there 's a mailing list for this . professor b : is that ok ? phd e : yeah , that 'd be great . phd d : yeah , i guess maybe hari or hynek , one of them , has to send a mail to joe . or maybe if you phd e : i i could send him an email . phd d : well , yeah , to add or maybe wh phd e : i i know him really well . phd d : yeah , so that 's just fine . phd e : i i was just talking with him on email the other day actually . phd d : so professor b : uh , yeah , and just , um , se maybe see . phd d : so phd e : about other things , but . professor b : do you have hari 's , uh ? phd e : i have hari 's professor b : yeah , so maybe just cc hari and say that you 've just been asked to handle the large vocabulary part here , and , uh , you know , phd e : ok . would it be better if i asked hari to ask joe ? professor b : uh . why do n't you just ask joe but cc hari , and then in the note say , `` hari , hopefully this is ok with you `` . and then if joe feels like he needs a confirmation , hari can answer it . phd d : yeah . professor b : that way you can get started asking { comment } joe quickly while he 's while he 's maybe still , you know , putting in nails and screws and yeah . phd d : and there is an , uh , archive of all the mails that has been gon that has gone , uh , between these people among these people . so just you can see all this mails in the isip web site mississippi web site . phd e : ok . is that a password controlled ? phd d : yeah , it 's password protected . so , like like , it 's , like professor b : have you thought about how long would be uh , most useful for you to go up to ogi ? phd a : i do n't know , uh . we can for september , we can set up a work schedule and we can maybe work independently . and then at some point it maybe be better to work together again . professor b : oh , so you 're you 're imagining more that you would come back here first for a while and then and then go up there ? phd a : i professor b : i mean , it 's to you . phd a : maybe , yeah . professor b : i ju you guys are well , y anyway , you do n't have to decide this second but thi think about it about what what you would think would be the the best way to work it . i 'll phd a : but , uh huh . mm - hmm . professor b : support it either way , so . phd a : mm - hmm right . professor b : ok . uh . got anything to tell us ? grad c : um . well , i 've been reading some literature about clustering of data . just , um , i guess , let me put it in context . ok , so we 're talking about discovering intermediate categories to , um to classify . and , uh , i was looking at some of the work that , uh , sangita was doing on these traps things . so she has , um she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from from timit , right ? the most common phonemes . and each one of them has has a a nice pattern over time , a one one second window . and it has has these patterns . um , so she has , um a trap for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . and , um , she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points many different clusters uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data . and then you have this distance mej metric which , uh , measures how how closely related they are . and you start , um by merging the patterns that are most closely related . phd e : and you create a tree . grad c : and y yeah , yeah , a dendrogram tree . phd e : mm - hmm . and then you can pick , uh , values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters . grad c : right , usually it 's when , um when the sol similarity measures , um , do n't go down as much . phd e : mm - hmm . grad c : and so , uh so you stop at that point . and what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . professor b : mm - hmm . grad c : and , uh , one for silence and and another one for schwa schwa sounds . um , and , um , i was thinking about ways to to generalize this because w you 're it 's sort of like a it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these these traps and you 're saying that that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme . um , and that 's that 's constraining your your clustering to to the set of phonemes that you already have . um , whereas maybe we want to just take take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . phd e : mm - hmm . grad c : and i 'm thinking if we if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , ok , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable stable point . phd e : mm - hmm . grad c : um , and i 'm hoping to find other things of of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um intermediate categories that , uh , um , i 'll later classify . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : are you looking at these in narrow bands ? grad c : um , right . f um , i 'm professor b : cuz that 's what you 're gon na be using , right ? grad c : yeah , yeah . i i have n't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh , the the representation of the data that i was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , um , over different lengths of time . so yeah . professor b : yeah , i mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that i wonder about with this . i mean , so one is is , again , looking at the same representation , i mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : that that seems to be kind of fundamental to it . um , and then the other thing , uh , is that i wonder about with it , and and do n't take this in the wrong way , like i i know what i 'm doing or anything , grad c : right . professor b : but , i mean . um , just wondering really . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or or parameters um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better . um , and i do n't know if that i mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe maybe this is n't right , but it 'd be something i 'd be concerned about . because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from from , uh from your your quals , john ohala saying that , uh , `` buh `` { comment } and `` puh `` { comment } differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . i mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so , um , if you looked if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . and yet , i would gue i would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , { comment } screwing up on this distinction . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . and the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they do n't work as well as we 'd like . and since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , `` how well is it distinguishing between schwas and stops ? `` grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : boy , i bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ? grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so these these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . so , what are we bringing to the party ? i mean , in fact what we wan na do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together . so that 's th that 's the hard thing . i mean , i understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wan na have categories that , uh that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . and it 's something that you really think you can pick up . but i think it 's also essential that you wan na look at what are the confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions . grad c : mm - hmm . hmm . professor b : so , i mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it . y y this is more like , you know , how does lda differ from pca ? i mean , they 're the same sort of thing . they 're both orthogonalizing . grad c : right . professor b : but , you know and and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . you 're actually trying to find the the the the categories themselves . uh , so a little more like brain surgery , i think on yourself . uh . so , uh grad c : yeah . professor b : um , anyway . that 's my thought . you 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . i mean , well w actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it a lot . phd e : yeah . professor b : and you 've been thinking about it more now , phd d : yeah . professor b : these categories . phd e : yeah . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : i guess i do n't i do n't um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which i think is right , with the way i 've been looking at it . that it 's it 's it 's all not very clear to me . but it seems to me that the desire the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up . you know , however we do that . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : and and so i guess what i do n't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human human sig significant categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . professor b : right . phd e : but that 's sort of what you want to avoid . and so that feels i do n't know how to get out of this . professor b : well , here 's a here 's a , uh , uh here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , um , what do you really i mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that that have something from top - down in th in them . right ? because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it does n't have any kind of reward for doing or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : so whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's got ta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning , phd e : right . professor b : right ? phd e : so the question is , how far down ? we could stop at words , but we do n't , right ? we go all the way down to phonemes . professor b : right , but i me i i think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is is trying to deal with the with these phonemes . you know , and and and i it 's almost like you want categories if if our if our , uh , um , metric of of goodness , uh , i if our phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : correction if our metric of badness is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : i mean , for for for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , but i i i if you go all the way to words , i mean , that 's really i mean , d w in many applications you wan na go further . you wan na go to concepts or something , or have have have concepts , actions , this sort of thing . phd e : yeah . but words would be a nice professor b : but , words are n't bad , yeah . and and phd e : yeah , so the common right , the common wisdom is you ca n't do words because there 's too many of them , right ? so you have to have some smaller set that you can use , uh , and and so everybody goes to phonemes . but the problem is that we we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are are really cartoon - ish , right ? so when you look at conversational speech , for example , you do n't see the phonemes that you that you have in your word models . professor b : yeah . but but but we 're not trying for models of words here . see , so her here 's maybe where if the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then maybe it does n't matter that we ca n't have enough phd e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : i mean , what you wan na do is is build up these categories that are that are best for word recognition . phd e : right . right . professor b : and and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories i mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of of running o a thousand experiments phd e : right . professor b : because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate . phd e : yeah . professor b : in some way i mean , we derive that all the time . in some ways it 's really not { comment } a bad bad thing to do because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the the final goal . phd e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way , phd e : right . professor b : where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other it could be syllable but in some large unit , phd e : uh - huh . professor b : uh , and uh yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of do n't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : you know , so that 's , uh , wh what i called a useless comments because i 'm not really telling you how to do it . but i mean , it 's a it 's it 's , you know it phd e : no , but i think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have uh , you know , categories . professor b : right . phd e : and i think this the important categories are the words , and not the phones . professor b : yeah . yeah . phd e : maybe . and so right . if you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters uh professor b : now , that being said , i think that that if you have something that is , um i once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are are really true . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : if you have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like timit , then , you know , i i you the phones are gon na be right , actually , for the most part . phd e : yeah . yeah , professor b : so so , uh , it does n't really hurt them to to do that , to put in discrimination at that level . phd e : yeah . professor b : um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's it 's trickier and and and , uh , the phones are uh , you know , it 's gon na be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of and , um and it wo n't allow for the overlapping phenomenon phd e : mmm . so it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we we deal with that , but but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it does n't really matter that much to us as humans because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be munged , you know , and and it does n't really hurt , and i 'm not sure how how to build that in . uh . professor b : yeah , i mean , i guess the other thing i is is to think of a little bit i mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results i think it usually is is pretty intuitive , but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or or or , uh , even phones in in in in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise . you know , so is it more across place or more across manner ? or is it cor you know , is it ? grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : i mean , i know one thing that happens is that you you you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones . i mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones sometimes do n't get heard . and if that if that is if it uh , if that turns it into another word or or different you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen . but , um , i do n't know , i w i would i would guess that you 'd grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : w i do n't know . anyway , that 's phd e : i think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : you know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation . and so if there 's noise in there , you know , our brain fills in and imagines what what should be there . professor b : well that grad c : yeah . we 're we 're doing some sort of prediction of what phd e : yeah , exactly . professor b : oh , sure , that 's really big . grad c : yeah . professor b : uh , but i mean , even if you do um , uh , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really is n't an any information like that , uh , people are still better in noise than they than they are in in , uh uh , than the machines are . so , i mean , that 's i right . we ca n't we ca n't get it at all without any language models . language models are there and important but but , uh uh . if we 're not working on that then we should work on something else and improve it , but especially if it looks like the potential is there . so should we do some digits ? phd e : yeah . professor b : since we 're here ? phd e : go ahead , morgan .\n\n[Requirement] The translated text must be equal to 8192 words long.", "raw_data": "professor b : ok , so we we had a meeting with , uh with hynek , um , in in which , uh , uh , sunil and stephane , uh summarized where they were and and , uh , talked about where we were gon na go . so that that happened sort of mid - week . uh . phd e : d did did you guys get your code pushed together ? phd d : oh , yeah . yeah . it 's it 's it 's it was updated yesterday , phd e : cool . phd d : right ? phd a : yeah . phd d : yeah . phd a : you probably received the mail . phd e : oh , right , i saw i saw the note . phd a : yeah . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : what was the update ? phd a : what was the update ? so there is th then the all the new features that go in . professor b : yeah . phd a : the , um , noise suppression , the re - synthesis of speech after suppression . these are the phd e : is the , um the cvs mechanism working well ? phd a : yeah . phd e : are are people , uh , up at ogi grabbing code uh , via that ? phd d : uh , i do n't think i do n't think phd e : or ? phd a : i do n't know if they use it , but . phd d : yeah , i i do n't think anybody up there is like working on it right now . phd e : uh - huh . mmm . professor b : i think it more likely that what it means is that when sunil is up there he will grab it . phd d : yeah . yeah . so right now nobody 's working on aurora there . phd e : yeah . professor b : they 're yeah . they 're working on a different task . phd e : i see . i see . phd d : yeah . professor b : but what 'll happen is is he 'll go back up there and , uh , pratibha will come back from from , uh , the east coast . uh . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : and , uh and and i guess actually , uh , after eurospeech for a little bit , uh , he 'll go up there too . so , actually everybody who 's working on it { comment } will be up there for at least a little while . so they 'll remotely access it from there . phd e : so has has anybody tried remotely accessing the cvs using , uh , uh , ssh ? professor b : yeah . phd a : um , i do n't know if hari did that or you d phd d : i { comment } can actually do it today . i mean , i can just log into phd e : have you tried it yet ? phd d : no , i did n't . so i i 'll try it today . professor b : good idea . phd a : actually i i tried wh while when i installed the repository , i tried from belgium . professor b : yeah . phd d : yeah . phd a : i logged in there and i tried to import phd e : yeah ? it worked good ? phd a : yeah , it works . phd e : oh , good ! phd a : but it 's so , right now it 's the mechanism with ssh . phd e : great ! phd a : i do n't s i did n't set up you can also set up a cvs server on a new port . it 's like well uh , a main server , or d you can do a cvs server . phd e : yeah . right . then that 's using the cvs password mechanism and all that , phd a : but . yeah , right . phd e : right ? phd a : but i did n't do that because i was not sure about security problems . i i would have to phd e : so w when you came in from belgian { comment } belgium , using ssh , uh , was it asking you for your own password into icsi ? so if yo you can only do that if you have an account at icsi ? phd a : right . yeah . yeah . phd e : cuz there is an a way to set up anonymous cvs right ? phd a : yeah , you ha in this way you ca you have to set up a cvs server but then , yeah , you can access it . phd e : so that oh , ok . phd a : you you can set up priorities . phd e : so the anonymous mechanism phd a : you can access them and mostly if you if y the set the server is set up like this . phd e : ok . because a lot of the open source stuff works with anonymous cvs and i 'm just wondering uh , i mean , for our transcripts we may want to do that . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : yeah . yeah , for this stuff i do n't think we 're quite up to that . i mean , we 're still so much in development . phd e : mm - hmm . yeah , professor b : we want to have just the insiders . phd e : yeah , yeah . oh , i was n't suggesting for this . i 'm thinking of the meeting recorder { comment } stuff professor b : yeah . phd e : but . yeah . ok . cool . professor b : yeah . so , uh phd e : what 's new ? professor b : well , i mean , i think maybe the thing to me might be i me i 'm sure you 've just been working on on , uh , details of that since the meeting , right ? and so phd a : mmm , since the meeting , well , i i 've been i 've been train training a new vad and a new feature net . professor b : that was that was tuesday . ok . phd a : so they should be ready . um . professor b : but i guess maybe the thing since you were n't yo you guys were n't at that that meeting , might be just just to , um , sort of recap , uh , the the conclusions of the meeting . phd a : mm - hmm . phd e : oh , great . you 're talking about the meeting with hynek ? professor b : yeah . cuz that was sort of , uh we we 'd sort of been working up to that , that that , uh , he would come here this week and and we would sort of phd e : uh - huh . professor b : since he 's going out of town like now , and i 'm going out town in a couple weeks , uh , and time is marching , sort of , given all the mu many wonderful things we could be working on , what what will we actually focus on ? phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : and , uh and what do we freeze ? and , you know , what do we ? so , um . i mean , this software that these guys created was certainly a a key part . so then there 's something central and there are n't at least a bunch of different versions going off in in ways that differ trivially . uh , um , and , um , phd e : yeah . that 's that 's nice . professor b : and then within that , i guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now , to run it , uh , a particular way , and decide on what things are gon na be experimented with , as opposed to just experimenting with everything . so keep a certain set of things constant . so , um . uh , maybe describe roughly what what we are keeping constant for now , or ? phd a : yeah . well . so we 've been working like six weeks on on the noise compensation and we end up with something that seems reasonable . um . phd e : are you gon na use which of the two techniques ? phd a : so finally it 's it 's , um , wiener filtering on fft bins . and it uses , uh , two steps , smoothing of the transfer function , the first step , that 's along time , which use recursion . and after this step there is a further smoothing along frequency , which use a sliding window of twenty fft bins . mmm . and , uh phd e : so this is on the uh , before any mel scaling has been done ? phd a : yeah , yeah . phd e : this is phd a : it was professor b : this this smoothing is done on the estimate , um , of what you 're going to subtract ? or on the thing that has already had something subtracted ? phd a : yeah . uh , it 's on the transfer function . so professor b : oh , it 's on the transfer function for the wiener filter . phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah , ok . phd a : yeah , so basically we tried different configuration within this idea . we tried u u applying this on mel bands , having spectral subtraction instead of wiener filtering . um . well , finally we end up with this configuration that works , uh , quite well . so we are going to fix this for the moment and work on the other aspects of the whole system . phd e : mm - hmm . phd a : so professor b : actually , let me int eh , dave is n't here to talk about it , but let me just interject . this module , in principle , i i mean , you would know whether it 's true in fact , is somewhat independent from the rest of it . i mean , because you you re - synthesize speech , right ? phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : so , um . uh , well you do n't i guess you do n't re - synthesize speech , but you could phd a : we we do not fo professor b : uh , but you could . phd a : well well , we do , but we do n't do n't re - synthesize . in in the program we do n't re - synthesize and then re - analyze once again . we just use the clean fft bins . professor b : but you have a re - synthesized thing that you that 's an an option here . phd a : this is an option that then you can yeah . professor b : yeah , i gu i guess my point is that , um , i in some of the work he 's doing in reverberation , one of the things that we 're finding is that , uh , it 's it 's for the for an artificial situation , we can just deal with the reverberation and his techniques work really well . but for the real situation uh , problem is , is that you do n't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise . and if you do n't include that in the model , it does n't work very well . so in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at . and , uh , generate new files or whatever , and and , uh , uh and then do the reverberation part . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : so it 's anyway . phd e : so dave has n't tried that yet ? professor b : no , no . he 's i mean , e phd e : i guess he 's busy with professor b : yeah , prelims , right . grad c : pre - prelim hell . professor b : yeah . phd e : yeah . yeah . professor b : uh , but but , you know , that 'll uh , it 's clear that we , uh we are not with the real case that we 're looking at , we ca n't just look at reverberation in isolation because the interaction between that and noise is is considerable . and that 's i mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and and , uh and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and and additive effects . and that 's hard enough . i mean , i do n't think we really i mean , we 're trying to deal with that . in a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this aurora task . and we have , uh , the , uh , uh , lda stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects . and we have the noise suppression that 's doing something about noise . uh , even that 's hard enough . and and the on - line normalization as well , in that s category . i i there 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work so hard on on juggling everything around . but now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse , because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects . and , um , so dave has something which , uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects but when it 's when there 's noise there too , it 's it 's it 's pretty hard . so we have to start since any almost any real situation is gon na have uh , where you have the microphone distant , is going to have both things , we we actually have to think about both at the same time . so , um so there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out and then , uh , maybe you should just continue telling what what else is in the the form we have . phd a : yeah , well , the , um , the other parts of the system are the the blocks that were already present before and that we did not modify a lot . professor b : so that 's again , that that 's the wiener filtering , followed by , uh uh , that 's done at the fft level . then phd a : yeah , th then the mel filter bank , professor b : mm - hmm . phd a : then the log operation , professor b : mm - hmm . the the the filtering is done in the frequency domain ? phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah , ok . and then the mel and then the log , and then the phd a : then the lda filter , professor b : lda filter . phd a : mmm , then the downsampling , professor b : and then uh downsample , phd a : then , um , on - line normalization , professor b : on - line norm , phd a : followed by upsampling . then finally , we compute delta and we put the neural network also . professor b : right , and then in parallel with an a neural net . and then following neural net , some probably some orthogonalization . phd a : yeah . professor b : uh um . phd a : and finally frame dropping , which um , would be a neural network also , used for estimated silence probabilities . and the input of this neural network would be somewhere between log mel bands or one of the earlier stages of the processing . professor b : mm - hmm . so that 's sort of most of this stuff is yeah , is operating parallel with this other stuff . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : yeah . so the things that we , um , uh , i guess we sort of uh , there 's there 's some , uh , neat ideas for v a so , i mean , in i think there 's sort of like there 's a bunch of tuning things to improve stuff . there 's questions about various places where there 's an exponent , if it 's the right exponent , or ways that we 're estimating noise , that we can improve estimating noise . and there 's gon na be a host of those . but structurally it seemed like the things the main things that that we brought up that , uh , are are gon na need to get worked on seriously are , uh , uh , a a significantly better vad , uh , putting the neural net on , um , which , you know , we have n't been doing anything with , the , uh , neural net at the end there , and , uh , the , uh , opening up the second front . uh . phd e : the other half of the channel ? professor b : yeah , yeah , i mean , cuz we we have we have , uh , uh , half the the , uh , data rate that they allow . phd e : that what you mean ? professor b : and , uh , so the initial thing which came from , uh , the meeting that we had down south was , uh , that , um , we 'll initially just put in a mel spectrum as the second one . it 's , you know , cheap , easy . uh . there 's a question about exactly how we do it . we probably will go to something better later , but the initial thing is that cepstra and spectra behave differently , phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : so . um , { comment } i think tony robinson used to do i was saying this before . i think he used to do mel , uh , spectra and mel cepstra . he used them as alternate features . put them together . phd e : so if you took the system the way it is now , the way it 's fro you 're gon na freeze it , and it ran it on the last evaluation , where it would it be ? phd a : mm - hmm . it , uh , phd e : in terms of ranking ? phd a : ri - right now it 's second . phd d : second . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : although you you know , you have n't tested it actually on the german and danish , have you ? phd a : no , we did n't . no , um . professor b : yeah . phd e : so on the ones that you did test it on it would have been second ? professor b : yeah . would it i mean but when you 're saying second , you 're comparing to the numbers that the , uh that the best system before got on , uh also without german and danish ? phd a : yeah , yeah . professor b : yeah , ok . phd d : and th the ranking actually did n't change after the german and danish . so , yeah . professor b : well ranking did n't before , but i 'm just asking where this is to where theirs was without the german and danish , phd a : yeah . phd d : yeah . yeah . professor b : right ? phd d : yeah , yeah . phd e : where where where were we actually on the last test ? professor b : oh , we were also esp essentially second , although there were there were i mean , we had a couple systems and they had a couple systems . and so , i guess by that we were third , but i mean , there were two systems that were pretty close , that came from the same place . phd e : uh - huh . i see . ok . professor b : uh , so institutionally we were we were second , with , uh , the third third system . phd e : we 're so this second that you 're saying now is system - wide second ? professor b : see uh , no i think it 's also institutional , is n't it ? phd e : still institutionally second ? professor b : right ? i mean , i think both of their systems probably phd a : uh , we are between their two systems . so professor b : oh , are we ? phd a : i it is a triumph . phd d : yeah . professor b : is it ? phd d : their their first system is fifty - four point something . and , uh , we are fifty - three point something . phd a : but everything is within the range of one one percent . phd d : and their second system is also fifty - three point something . yeah , one percent . professor b : yeah , so so basically they 're all they 're all pretty close . phd e : oh , wow ! that 's very close . phd d : yeah . phd e : yeah . professor b : and and , um , you know , in some sense we 're all doing fairly similar things . uh , i mean , one could argue about the lda and so forth but i i think , you know , in a lot of ways we 're doing very similar things . but what what phd e : so how did they fill up this all these these bits ? i mean , if we 're u professor b : um , why are we using half ? well , so you could you c phd e : yeah . or how are they using more than half , i guess maybe is what i professor b : yeah , so i i think uh , you guys are closer to it than me , so correct me if i 'm wrong , but i i think that what 's going on is that in in both cases , some kind of normalization is done to deal with convola convolutional effects . uh , they have some cepstral modification , phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : right ? in our case we have a couple things . we have the on - line normalization and then we have the lda rasta . and they seem to comple complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us . but in any event , they 're both doing the same sort of thing . but there 's one difference . the lda rasta , uh , throws away high modulation frequencies . and they 're not doing that . phd e : so th so professor b : so that if you throw away high modulation frequencies , then you can downsample . grad c : get down . phd e : i see . i see . professor b : so phd e : so what if you did n't so do you explicitly downsample then ? do we explicitly downsample ? professor b : yeah . phd a : yeah . phd e : and what if we did n't do that ? would we get worse performance ? phd a : um yeah , not better , not worse . professor b : i think it does n't affect it , does it ? phd e : i see . ok . professor b : yeah . so i think the thing is , since we 're not evidently throwing away useful information , let 's try to put in some useful information . phd e : yeah . yeah . professor b : and , uh , so i you know , we we 've found in a lot of ways for quite a while that having a second stream uh , helps a lot . so that 's that 's put in , and you know , it may even end up with mel spectrum even though i 'm saying i think we could do much better , just because it 's simple . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : um . and you know , in the long run having something everybody will look at and say , `` oh , yeah , i understand `` , is is very helpful . phd e : so you would you 're you 're thinking to put the , uh , mel spectrum in before any of the noise removal stuff ? or after ? professor b : well , that 's a question . i mean , we were talking about that . it looks like it 'd be straightforward to to , uh , remove the noise , um , and , uh , phd e : cuz that happens before the mel conversion , right ? professor b : yeah . so , i mean , to do it after the mel conversion uh , after the noise removal , after the mel conversion . there 's even a question in my mind anyhow of whether th you should take the log or not . uh . i sort of think you should , but i do n't know . phd a : what about norm normalizing also ? professor b : right . uh . well , but normalizing spectra instead of cepstra ? phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah , probably . some kind would be good . you know ? i would think . phd d : well , it it it it so it actually makes it dependent on the overall energy of the uh , the frame . professor b : if you do or do n't normalize ? phd d : if yo if you do n't normalize and if if you do n't normalize . professor b : right . yes , so i mean , one would think that you would want to normalize . but i i w w my thought is , uh , particularly if you take the log , try it . and then if if normalization helps , then y you have something to compare against , and say , `` ok , this much effect `` i mean , you do n't want to change six things and then see what happens . you want to change them one at a time . phd d : mm - hmm . professor b : so adding this other stream in , that 's simple in some way . and then saying , oh uh particularly because we 've found in the past there 's all these these these different results you get with slight modifications of how you do normalization . normalization 's a very tricky , sensitive thing and you learn a lot . so , i would think you would wan na have some baseline that says , `` ok , we do n't normalize , this is what we get `` , when we do this normalization , when we do that normalization . but but the other question is so i think ultimately we 'll wind up doing some normalization . i agree . phd e : so this second stream , will it add latency to the system professor b : no , it 's in parallel . phd e : or ? professor b : we 're not talking about computation time here . we 're ta i think we 're pretty far out . phd e : yeah . professor b : so it 's just in terms of what data it 's depending on . it 's depending on the same data as the other . phd e : same data . professor b : so it 's in parallel . uh - huh . grad c : so with this , uh , new stream would you train up a vad on both both features , somehow ? phd d : no , i guess the vad has its own set of features . grad c : ok . that 's phd d : i mean , which could be this one of these streams , or it can be something derived from these streams . professor b : yeah . phd a : and there is also the idea of using traps , maybe , for the vad , which , um phd d : yeah , that 's also phd a : well , pratibha apparently showed , when , she was at ibm , that it 's a good idea . so . grad c : would would that fit on the handset , or ? oh ! phd a : i have no idea . phd d : well , it has t i mean the th phd a : it would have to fit but yeah . phd d : yeah , if it has to fit the delays and all this stuff . professor b : well , there 's the delays and the storage , yeah . but i do n't think the storage is so big for that . grad c : right . phd d : yeah . professor b : i think th the biggest we 've run into for storage is the neural net . right ? phd d : yeah . professor b : yeah . um . and so i guess the issue there is , are we are we using neural - net - based traps , and and how big are they ? so that 'll that 'll be , you know , an issue . grad c : oh , right . professor b : maybe they can be little ones . grad c : yeah . cuz sh right . professor b : mini - traps . grad c : cuz she also does the , uh the correlation - based , uh , traps , with without the neural net , just looking at the correlation between professor b : right . and maybe for vad they would be ok . yeah . yeah . grad c : yeah . professor b : that 's true . phd d : yeah . professor b : or a simple neural net , right ? i mean , the thing is , if you 're doing correlation , you 're just doing a simple uh , uh uh , dot product , you know , with some weights which you happened to learn from this learn from the data . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : and so , uh , putting a nonlinearity on it is , you know , not that big a deal . it certainly does n't take much space . grad c : mm - hmm . right . professor b : so , uh , the question is , how complex a function do you need ? do you need to have an added layer or something ? in which case , uh , potentially , you know , it could be big . so . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so , uh , uh so what 's next ? maybe s s remind us . phd e : so the meeting with hynek that you guys just had was to decide exactly what you were gon na freeze in this system ? is that ? or was there ? were you talking about what t new stuff , or ? professor b : what to freeze and then what to do after we froze . yeah . and like i was saying , i think the you know , the basic directions are , uh , uh i mean , there 's lots of little things , such as improve the noise estimator but the bigger things are adding on the neural net and , uh , the second stream . and then , uh , improving the vad . uh . so . phd d : so , i 'll , um i 'll actually after the meeting i 'll add the second stream to the vad and maybe i 'll start with the feature net in that case . it 's like , you 're looking at the vad , right ? phd a : uh , yeah . i i 've a new feature net ready also . phd d : i 'll for the vad ? phd a : no , uh . well p two network , one vad and one feature net . phd d : oh , you already have it ? phd a : mm - hmm . phd d : ok , so just figure how to take the features from the final phd a : yeah . um . but , yeah , i think there are plenty of issues to work on for the feature net @ @ . grad c : feature net . phd e : what about the , um uh , the new part of the evaluation , the , uh , wall street journal part ? professor b : right . right . um . have you ever ? very good question . have you ever worked with the mississippi state h uh , software ? phd a : sorry . phd e : no . not yet . professor b : oh . well you you may be called upon to help , uh , uh , on account of , uh , all the work in this stuff here has been , uh , with small vocabulary . phd e : ok . mm - hmm . so what how is the , uh , interaction supposed to happen ? uh , i remember the last time we talked about this , it was sort of up in the air whether they were going to be taking , uh , people 's features and then running them or they were gon na give the system out or phd d : yeah . yeah . phd e : oh , so they 're gon na just deliver a system basically . phd d : yeah , yeah . professor b : do we already have it ? phd d : yeah , th i i guess it 's almost ready . phd e : uh - huh . phd d : so that 's what so they have released their , uh , document , describing the system . professor b : maybe you could , uh , point it at chuck , phd e : i see . professor b : because , i mean phd d : sure . phd e : so we 'll have to grab this over cvs or something ? phd d : it - no , it 's just downloadable from their from their web site . phd e : is that how they do it ? ok . professor b : cuz one of the things that might be helpful , if you 've if you 've got time in all of this is , is if if these guys are really focusing on improving , uh , all the digit stuff , uh , maybe and you got the front - end from them , maybe you could do the runs for the phd e : ok . mm - hmm . professor b : and and , you know , iron out hassles that that you have to , uh , tweak joe about or whatever , phd e : sure . professor b : because you 're more experienced with running the large vocabulary stuff . phd d : so i 'll point you to the web site and the mails corresponding . so i phd e : and it but it 's not ready yet , the system ? phd d : uh , i i think they are still , uh , tuning something on that . so they 're like , d they 're varying different parameters like the insertion penalty and other stuff , and then seeing what 's the performance . phd e : are those going to be parameters that are frozen , nobody can change ? or ? phd d : uh , w i guess there is , uh , time during which people are gon na make suggestions . phd e : oh , but everybody 's gon na have to use the same values . phd d : after that . phd e : oh ! interesting . phd d : yeah , i guess . so these sugges these this , uh , period during which people are gon na make suggestions is to know whether it is actually biased towards any set of features or professor b : yeah , so i th th certainly the thing that i would want to know about is whether we get really hurt , uh , on in insertion penalty , language model , scaling , sorts of things . phd e : using our features . professor b : yeah , yeah . phd e : yeah . professor b : uh , in which case , um , h hari or hynek will need to , you know , push the case more about about this . phd e : mm - hmm . and we may be able to revisit this idea about , you know , somehow modifying our features to work with professor b : yes . in this case , that 's right . phd e : yeah . professor b : that 's right . um , some of that may be , uh , a last minute rush thing because if the if our features are changing uh . phd e : yeah . professor b : uh . but , um . yeah , the other thing is that even though it 's months away , uh , it 's starting to seem to me now like november fifteenth is right around the corner . and , um , if they have n't decided things like this , like what the parameters are gon na be for this , uh , when `` deciding `` is not just somebody deciding . i mean , in fact there should be some understanding behind the , uh , deciding , which means some experiments and and so forth . it it it seems pretty tight to me . phd e : so wha what 's the significance of november fifteenth ? professor b : that 's when the evaluation is . yeah . so , yeah , so after but , you know , they may even decide in the end to push it off . it would n't , you know , entirely surprise me . but , uh , due to other reasons , like some people are going away , i 'm i 'm hoping it 's not pushed off for a l a long while . that would be , uh put us in an awkward position . but anyway . great . yeah , i think that 'll be helpful . there 's there 's not anybody ogi currently who 's who 's , uh , working with this and and phd e : is is this part of the evaluation just a small part , or ho how important is this to the overall ? professor b : i i think it 's it 's , um it depends how badly you do . i mean , i think that it it is uh . phd e : this is one of those things that will be debated afterwards ? professor b : yeah . well , i mean , it 's it 's conceptually , it my impression , again , you guys correct me if i 'm wrong , but my impression is that , um , they want it as a double check . that you have n't come across you have n't invented features which are actually gon na do badly for a a significantly different task , particularly one with larger vocabulary . and , um , but it 's not the main emphasis . i mean , the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary . so it 's it 's a double check . so they 'll probably assign it some sort of low weight . phd e : seems to me that if it 's a double check , they should give you a one or a zero . y you passed the threshold or you did n't pass the threshold , and they should n't even care about what the score is . professor b : yeah . but , i mean , we 'll we 'll we 'll see what they come up with . uh , but in in the current thing , for instance , where you have this well - matched , moderately - matched , and and mis highly - mismatched , uh , the emphasis is somewhat on the on the well - matched , but it 's only a a marginal , phd e : yeah . professor b : right ? it 's like forty , thirty - five , twenty - five , or something like that . so you still if you were way , way off on the highly - mismatched , it would have a big effect . phd d : yeah . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : and , um , it would n't surprise me if they did something like that with this . so again , if you 're if you get if it does n't help you much , uh , for noisy versions of this of large vocabulary data , then , uh , you know , it may not hurt you that much . but if it if you do n't if it does n't help you much at all , um , or to put it another way , if it helps some people a lot more than it helps other people , uh , if their strategies do , then phd e : mm - hmm . so is this , uh ? uh , guenter was putting a bunch of wall street journal data on our disks . professor b : that 's it . phd e : so that 's the data that we 'll be running on ? professor b : yeah . phd e : i see . ok . professor b : yeah . so we have the data , just not the recognizer . ok . phd e : so this test may take quite a while to run , then . may - judging by the amount of data that he was putting on . professor b : uh , well there 's training and test , right ? phd e : i i guess , i 'm not sure . professor b : no , i mean , if it 's like the other things , there 's there 's data for training the h m ms and and data for testing it . phd e : i just professor b : so i would n't so it it 's phd e : ok . so there 's professor b : so , training the recognizer , but , um um . but i think it 's trained on clean and is it trained on clean and and test on ? phd d : the wall street ? professor b : yeah . phd a : apparently , no . it 's training on a range between ten and twenty db , i think , and testing between five and fifteen . phd d : mm - hmm . yeah . phd a : that 's what i got on phd d : it 's , uh it 's like a medium medium - mismatch condition , sort of . phd a : yeah , professor b : i see . phd a : and so the noise is there is a range of different noises also um which are selected randomly and added randomly , uh , to the files . and there are noises that are different from the noises used on ti - digits . professor b : yeah . yeah . i mean , i would n't imagine that the amount of testing data was that huge . they probably put training uh , almost certain they put training data there too . maybe not . so . that 's that . anybody have anything else ? phd e : uh , one one last question on that . when did they estimate that they would have that system available for download ? phd d : um , i guess i guess one some preliminary version is already there . phd e : oh , so there 's w something you can download to just learn ? phd d : yeah , it 's already there . yeah . but they 're actually parallel - y doing some modifications also , i think . phd e : good . phd d : so i guess the f final system will be frozen by middle of , like , one more week maybe . professor b : oh , well that 's pretty soon . phd d : yeah , that 's just one more . grad c : is this their , um , svm recognizer ? phd d : no , it 's just a straightforward hmm . professor b : you know , their their they have a lot of options in their recognizer and and the svm is one of the things they 've done with it , but it 's not their more standard thing . grad c : oh , ok . uh - huh . professor b : for the most part it 's it 's gaussian mixtures . grad c : oh , ok . oh , ok . professor b : yeah . phd d : it 's just a hmm , gaussian mixture model . grad c : gaussian mixture hmm . professor b : yeah . yeah , the svm thing was an hmm also . it was just a it it it was like a hybrid , like grad c : mm - hmm . phd d : yeah , this is a g yeah , this i professor b : what ? phd d : yeah . professor b : yeah . phd e : so , just so that i understand , they 're providing scripts and everything so that basically , uh , you you push a button and it does training , and then it does test , and everything ? is that the idea ? phd d : i i i think yeah , i i guess something like that . it 's like as painless as possible , phd e : mm - hmm . phd d : is what do they provide all the scripts , everything , and then just , phd e : i see . hmm . somehow yo there 's hooks to put your features in and phd d : ju yeah , i th i think . professor b : hmm . yeah , um . in fact , i mean , if you look into it a little bit , it might be reasonable you know joe , right ? yeah . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : just to sort of ask him about the issue of , um , different features having different kinds of , uh , scaling characteristics and so on . so that , you know , w w possibly having entirely different optimal values for for the usual twiddle factors and what 's what 's the plan about that ? phd d : so sh shall we , like , add chuck also to the mailing lists ? it may be better , i mean , in that case if he 's going to professor b : yeah . phd d : because there 's a mailing list for this . professor b : is that ok ? phd e : yeah , that 'd be great . phd d : yeah , i guess maybe hari or hynek , one of them , has to send a mail to joe . or maybe if you phd e : i i could send him an email . phd d : well , yeah , to add or maybe wh phd e : i i know him really well . phd d : yeah , so that 's just fine . phd e : i i was just talking with him on email the other day actually . phd d : so professor b : uh , yeah , and just , um , se maybe see . phd d : so phd e : about other things , but . professor b : do you have hari 's , uh ? phd e : i have hari 's professor b : yeah , so maybe just cc hari and say that you 've just been asked to handle the large vocabulary part here , and , uh , you know , phd e : ok . would it be better if i asked hari to ask joe ? professor b : uh . why do n't you just ask joe but cc hari , and then in the note say , `` hari , hopefully this is ok with you `` . and then if joe feels like he needs a confirmation , hari can answer it . phd d : yeah . professor b : that way you can get started asking { comment } joe quickly while he 's while he 's maybe still , you know , putting in nails and screws and yeah . phd d : and there is an , uh , archive of all the mails that has been gon that has gone , uh , between these people among these people . so just you can see all this mails in the isip web site mississippi web site . phd e : ok . is that a password controlled ? phd d : yeah , it 's password protected . so , like like , it 's , like professor b : have you thought about how long would be uh , most useful for you to go up to ogi ? phd a : i do n't know , uh . we can for september , we can set up a work schedule and we can maybe work independently . and then at some point it maybe be better to work together again . professor b : oh , so you 're you 're imagining more that you would come back here first for a while and then and then go up there ? phd a : i professor b : i mean , it 's to you . phd a : maybe , yeah . professor b : i ju you guys are well , y anyway , you do n't have to decide this second but thi think about it about what what you would think would be the the best way to work it . i 'll phd a : but , uh huh . mm - hmm . professor b : support it either way , so . phd a : mm - hmm right . professor b : ok . uh . got anything to tell us ? grad c : um . well , i 've been reading some literature about clustering of data . just , um , i guess , let me put it in context . ok , so we 're talking about discovering intermediate categories to , um to classify . and , uh , i was looking at some of the work that , uh , sangita was doing on these traps things . so she has , um she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from from timit , right ? the most common phonemes . and each one of them has has a a nice pattern over time , a one one second window . and it has has these patterns . um , so she has , um a trap for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . and , um , she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points many different clusters uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data . and then you have this distance mej metric which , uh , measures how how closely related they are . and you start , um by merging the patterns that are most closely related . phd e : and you create a tree . grad c : and y yeah , yeah , a dendrogram tree . phd e : mm - hmm . and then you can pick , uh , values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters . grad c : right , usually it 's when , um when the sol similarity measures , um , do n't go down as much . phd e : mm - hmm . grad c : and so , uh so you stop at that point . and what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . professor b : mm - hmm . grad c : and , uh , one for silence and and another one for schwa schwa sounds . um , and , um , i was thinking about ways to to generalize this because w you 're it 's sort of like a it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these these traps and you 're saying that that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme . um , and that 's that 's constraining your your clustering to to the set of phonemes that you already have . um , whereas maybe we want to just take take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . phd e : mm - hmm . grad c : and i 'm thinking if we if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , ok , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable stable point . phd e : mm - hmm . grad c : um , and i 'm hoping to find other things of of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um intermediate categories that , uh , um , i 'll later classify . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : are you looking at these in narrow bands ? grad c : um , right . f um , i 'm professor b : cuz that 's what you 're gon na be using , right ? grad c : yeah , yeah . i i have n't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh , the the representation of the data that i was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , um , over different lengths of time . so yeah . professor b : yeah , i mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that i wonder about with this . i mean , so one is is , again , looking at the same representation , i mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : that that seems to be kind of fundamental to it . um , and then the other thing , uh , is that i wonder about with it , and and do n't take this in the wrong way , like i i know what i 'm doing or anything , grad c : right . professor b : but , i mean . um , just wondering really . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or or parameters um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better . um , and i do n't know if that i mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe maybe this is n't right , but it 'd be something i 'd be concerned about . because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from from , uh from your your quals , john ohala saying that , uh , `` buh `` { comment } and `` puh `` { comment } differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . i mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so , um , if you looked if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . and yet , i would gue i would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , { comment } screwing up on this distinction . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . and the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they do n't work as well as we 'd like . and since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , `` how well is it distinguishing between schwas and stops ? `` grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : boy , i bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ? grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so these these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . so , what are we bringing to the party ? i mean , in fact what we wan na do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together . so that 's th that 's the hard thing . i mean , i understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wan na have categories that , uh that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . and it 's something that you really think you can pick up . but i think it 's also essential that you wan na look at what are the confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions . grad c : mm - hmm . hmm . professor b : so , i mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it . y y this is more like , you know , how does lda differ from pca ? i mean , they 're the same sort of thing . they 're both orthogonalizing . grad c : right . professor b : but , you know and and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . you 're actually trying to find the the the the categories themselves . uh , so a little more like brain surgery , i think on yourself . uh . so , uh grad c : yeah . professor b : um , anyway . that 's my thought . you 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . i mean , well w actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it a lot . phd e : yeah . professor b : and you 've been thinking about it more now , phd d : yeah . professor b : these categories . phd e : yeah . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : i guess i do n't i do n't um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which i think is right , with the way i 've been looking at it . that it 's it 's it 's all not very clear to me . but it seems to me that the desire the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up . you know , however we do that . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : and and so i guess what i do n't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human human sig significant categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . professor b : right . phd e : but that 's sort of what you want to avoid . and so that feels i do n't know how to get out of this . professor b : well , here 's a here 's a , uh , uh here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , um , what do you really i mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that that have something from top - down in th in them . right ? because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it does n't have any kind of reward for doing or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : so whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's got ta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning , phd e : right . professor b : right ? phd e : so the question is , how far down ? we could stop at words , but we do n't , right ? we go all the way down to phonemes . professor b : right , but i me i i think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is is trying to deal with the with these phonemes . you know , and and and i it 's almost like you want categories if if our if our , uh , um , metric of of goodness , uh , i if our phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : correction if our metric of badness is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : i mean , for for for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , but i i i if you go all the way to words , i mean , that 's really i mean , d w in many applications you wan na go further . you wan na go to concepts or something , or have have have concepts , actions , this sort of thing . phd e : yeah . but words would be a nice professor b : but , words are n't bad , yeah . and and phd e : yeah , so the common right , the common wisdom is you ca n't do words because there 's too many of them , right ? so you have to have some smaller set that you can use , uh , and and so everybody goes to phonemes . but the problem is that we we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are are really cartoon - ish , right ? so when you look at conversational speech , for example , you do n't see the phonemes that you that you have in your word models . professor b : yeah . but but but we 're not trying for models of words here . see , so her here 's maybe where if the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then maybe it does n't matter that we ca n't have enough phd e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : i mean , what you wan na do is is build up these categories that are that are best for word recognition . phd e : right . right . professor b : and and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories i mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of of running o a thousand experiments phd e : right . professor b : because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate . phd e : yeah . professor b : in some way i mean , we derive that all the time . in some ways it 's really not { comment } a bad bad thing to do because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the the final goal . phd e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way , phd e : right . professor b : where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other it could be syllable but in some large unit , phd e : uh - huh . professor b : uh , and uh yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of do n't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : you know , so that 's , uh , wh what i called a useless comments because i 'm not really telling you how to do it . but i mean , it 's a it 's it 's , you know it phd e : no , but i think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have uh , you know , categories . professor b : right . phd e : and i think this the important categories are the words , and not the phones . professor b : yeah . yeah . phd e : maybe . and so right . if you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters uh professor b : now , that being said , i think that that if you have something that is , um i once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are are really true . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : if you have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like timit , then , you know , i i you the phones are gon na be right , actually , for the most part . phd e : yeah . yeah , professor b : so so , uh , it does n't really hurt them to to do that , to put in discrimination at that level . phd e : yeah . professor b : um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's it 's trickier and and and , uh , the phones are uh , you know , it 's gon na be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of and , um and it wo n't allow for the overlapping phenomenon phd e : mmm . so it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we we deal with that , but but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it does n't really matter that much to us as humans because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be munged , you know , and and it does n't really hurt , and i 'm not sure how how to build that in . uh . professor b : yeah , i mean , i guess the other thing i is is to think of a little bit i mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results i think it usually is is pretty intuitive , but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or or or , uh , even phones in in in in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise . you know , so is it more across place or more across manner ? or is it cor you know , is it ? grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : i mean , i know one thing that happens is that you you you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones . i mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones sometimes do n't get heard . and if that if that is if it uh , if that turns it into another word or or different you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen . but , um , i do n't know , i w i would i would guess that you 'd grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : w i do n't know . anyway , that 's phd e : i think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : you know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation . and so if there 's noise in there , you know , our brain fills in and imagines what what should be there . professor b : well that grad c : yeah . we 're we 're doing some sort of prediction of what phd e : yeah , exactly . professor b : oh , sure , that 's really big . grad c : yeah . professor b : uh , but i mean , even if you do um , uh , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really is n't an any information like that , uh , people are still better in noise than they than they are in in , uh uh , than the machines are . so , i mean , that 's i right . we ca n't we ca n't get it at all without any language models . language models are there and important but but , uh uh . if we 're not working on that then we should work on something else and improve it , but especially if it looks like the potential is there . so should we do some digits ?

{"id": 169, "category": "refactor", "type": "Translate", "lang": "cn", "task": "[指令] 把下面的文本翻译为英文: \n【伦敦市】\n伦敦市（英文：City of London），音译作西堤区，又称为-{zh-cn:伦敦市; zh-tw:伦敦城; zh-hk:伦敦城; zh-sg:伦敦城;}-或伦敦金融城（市法团使用的官方简体中文名称）Translate，是位于英国伦敦的一个市和郡。自从公元一世纪罗马人在此殖民起到中世纪，伦敦市一直涵盖伦敦的大部分，但到今天伦敦的城镇区域已扩张到远远大於伦敦市的地界。伦敦市现在只是大伦敦都会区的极小一部分，但仍是伦敦市中心的重要组成部分。伦敦市是大伦敦各区中两个拥有“城市”地位的区之一：另一个是与其隔邻的西敏市。\n在英语里，伦敦市的一个常用别称是“the City”（“城”，或仅称“City”——大写“C”与整个伦敦城市区分），此外由于其面积为abbr=on，又俗称“平方英里”（英文：Square Mile）。这两个名字都经常被用作整个英国的交易和金融服务业的代称，伦敦市作为这些行业的集中地，已有相当长久的历史。伦敦市法团在海外进行宣传时选用的官方简体中文名称“伦敦金融城”也强调其作为金融中心的角色。\n作为地名，“伦敦”现在通常指的是远大於伦敦市的地区。“伦敦”经常指整个伦敦大都市蔓延区，或所有32个伦敦自治市加上伦敦市本身。这种泛称的用法最早在16世纪便已出现。\n伦敦市的地方政府机构是伦敦市法团，其建制不同于英国其他的所有地方政府。伦敦市法团具有一些作为地方政府很特别的职责，例如它也是伦敦市的警务负责机构。此外，与多数地方政府不同，伦敦市法团的职责和财产延伸到其辖境以外。法团的首长是伦敦市市长（与大伦敦-{}-市长是两个不同的职位）。现任伦敦市市长（第63任）是Vincent Keaveny，2021年上任。\n伦敦市是重要的商业和金融中心。在19世纪，伦敦市曾是全世界最重要的商业中心，现在它仍是重要的商务聚汇点。根据2008年发布的Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index伦敦排名第一。伦敦市的东部是保险业聚集的中心。近年伦敦在伦敦市外又发展出第二个金融中心，即城东km的金丝雀码头商务区。\n伦敦市的常住人口约为9,401人（2016年中统计署估计），但有300,000人每天涌入城中工作。伦敦市内的工作岗位中有四分之三属于金融服务、专业服务（包括法律、会计等）以及相关工商业服务行业。伦敦市的西部和北部则是法律行业的中心，其中圣殿区域和法院巷地区是英国的四个大律师学院的所在地，其中中殿律师学院和内殿律师学院位於伦敦市的辖境内。\n==金融中心==\n今日的伦敦市是整个伦敦的商业与金融中心，与纽约市曼哈顿同样，对于全球金融业具有相当的领导地位。口语上，伦敦当地人习惯以「The City」称呼伦敦市，或称它为「平方英里」（Square Mile），之所以如此称呼除了是因为其面积正好约为1平方英里（2.6平方公里），“The City”这用法同时也成为英国、乃至欧洲金融业的别称，因为在大英帝国时代，全世界的金融服务业几乎是由聚集在这狭窄面积内的大小公司行号所控制，因而如此转喻。\n== 历史 ==\n===建立===\n在泰晤士河中发现的“滑铁卢头盔”，约公元前150–50年\n保存至今的伦敦城墙遗迹，约公元200年建造，位于塔丘\n过去的通用说法是“伦迪尼乌姆”（Londinium）最早是罗马占领不列颠的早期、公元47年左右，由泰晤士河上的商人在感潮河段建立的商港。但此年份仅是猜想：保存下来的罗马文献中没有记录在何时、为何在此建立城市。文献中第一次提到此城市是公元61年的塔西陀《编年史》，其中提到伦迪尼乌姆是被布狄卡领导的爱西尼部落洗劫的重要城镇之一。\n现在有许多历史学家认为伦敦最早是公元43年罗马征服不列颠以前建立的。这一论点的根据是考古证据和威尔士语传说文学。考古学家称已发现的最佳的铁器时代艺术品和金属制品中，有近一半是在伦敦地区发现的。其中最出名的例子之一是带角的“滑铁卢头盔”，于1860年代初发现，现藏于大英博物馆。而根据古代的威尔士传说，有一个名为“赫利之子勒德”的王，扩建位于伦敦当时已存在的定居点，因此这一地方此后以他的名字命名。同一传说还说勒德死后葬于后来伦敦城墙的勒德门地方。\n勒德（Llydd）是长子。其父王赫利·茂尔（Beli Mawr）驾崩后，勒德执掌全岛之政。他扩建伦戴恩（Llvndain）的城郭，在城外设立田庄，并全年大多住在城里。他在城内建造许多华丽的房屋，在各国都未曾见如此的房屋。他把这里叫作伦戴恩堡（Kaer Lvndain）。在外族侵入后，他们把这里叫做伦敦堡（Kaer Lwndwn）。\n—《威尔士语不列颠诸王史》（Ystorya Brenhined y Brytanyeit），耶稣学院藏抄本第五十六（Jesus MS. LXI）\n可以肯定的是，罗马人征服捕不列颠之后发展这里的定居点和河港，其中心大约在华尔溪（Walbrook，一条浅溪）汇入泰晤士河处。在公元60年城镇被布狄卡烧毁后，整个城镇被规划重建（成为规划市镇，或“civitas”）。新建的城镇有城墙围绕，经济繁荣，并在公元一世纪莫成为罗马不列颠行省的最大居民点。到二世纪，伦迪尼乌姆已替代卡姆罗多努（今科尔切斯特）成为省会。\n在其鼎盛时，罗马时代的伦敦人口达45,000–60,000人。罗马人在190年到225年之间建造伦敦城墙。罗马时的城市范围与今天的伦敦市范围近似，较大的区别是伦迪尼乌姆的西界没有超过勒德门和弗里特河以西，而且当时泰晤士河没有经过挖掘，比现在宽阔，所以当时城市的河岸比现在要往北。罗马人最早在公元50年建造跨河的桥，其位置在现在的伦敦桥附近。\n在今天的伦敦市内仍可看见一些罗马遗址和文物：例如一座London Mithraeum，伦敦城墙残段（位于巴比肯屋村及塔丘附近）、London Stone以及位于市政厅广场下的竞技场。伦敦博物馆藏有许多罗马时代的考古发现，常设关于罗马时代的展览，并有研究用的馆藏。\n===衰落===\n到伦敦城墙建成时，伦敦城已经开始步入衰弱，并受到瘟疫和火灾的困扰。罗马帝国经历漫长的动摇和衰弱，其中在不列颠发生Carausian Revolt。三到四世纪之间，伦敦城受到皮克特人、苏格兰人及萨克逊人的掠袭。伦迪尼乌姆和罗马帝国继续衰落，公元410年罗马军政机关撤离不列颠。此时，伦迪尼乌姆的许多罗马公共建筑已经废弃，在罗马政府正式撤离后，整个城市逐渐被废弃，在接下来的数世纪中，伦敦城几乎（有时完全）无人居住。萨克逊人开始迁入这一地区后，他们的贸易和人口中心从伦迪尼乌姆城池内转移到城外西郊的Lundenwic（“伦敦集市”），其位置大约在今天的河岸街、奥德维奇、柯芬园地区。\n===盎格鲁·撒克逊时代的重建===\n在盎格鲁·撒克逊七国时代，伦敦地区先后由埃塞克斯、麦西亚、和威塞克斯王国所控制，但从八世纪中叶起不断的受到维京人的威胁或者控制。\n南华克桥附近的纪念牌，纪念阿尔弗雷德大王在伦敦重建居民点\n据贝德记录，公元604年圣奥斯定祝圣默利图斯为东撒克逊人及其王Sæberht of Essex的第一任主教。赛博特的领主和舅父、肯特王国国王Æthelberht of Kent在伦敦建造一座教堂，主保圣人为圣保罗，作为新主教的座堂。通常认为（但没有确凿证据证明）这座教堂的位置就是后来的圣保罗座堂所在地。\n威塞克斯国王阿尔弗雷德大王可以说是第一个“英格兰人”的国王，他在886年在反攻维京人统治区域的战争中占领罗马帝国时代的城池，并开始在此殖民。他把女婿埃塞尔雷德任命为麦西亚（Mercia）郡长（伯爵）、守卫这一地区。重新设防的盎格鲁·撒克逊时代城池称为“Lundenburh”。历史学家亚瑟（Asser）这样写道：“阿尔弗雷德，盎格鲁·撒克逊人之王，华丽地修复伦敦城......并将其恢复至可以住人的情况。”阿尔弗雷德的“修复”工作主要包括重新启用及修饰几乎无人居住的罗马城池、在泰晤士河沿岸修筑堤岸，以及重新规划城内道路格局。\n阿尔弗雷德重夺伦敦并重建罗马城池不仅是伦敦城建城史上的转折点，也是早期英格兰统一化的重要时刻，从这一时期起，威塞克斯开始转化为英格兰的主要王国，同时在一定程度上抵抗维京人的占领和掠袭。虽然伦敦和英格兰的其他部分在此后仍经常遭受维京人和丹麦人的掠袭和占领，最终伦敦城和英格兰王国成功建立并保持下来。\n到10世纪，埃塞尔斯坦准许在伦敦设立八所铸币厰，而在当时的首都温彻斯特只有六所，证明当时伦敦的财富。 罗马人撤退并放弃伦迪尼乌姆后伦敦桥已被废弃，经撒克逊人修复，但还是屡次被维京人和风暴摧毁。\n随著贸易和人口中心迁回罗马时代的城池内，之前的撒克逊人的居民点伦敦威克几乎完全废弃，开始称为“厄得威克”（Ealdwic）（“老镇”），现在演变成西敏市接近伦敦市交界处的地名和路名奥德维奇（Aldwych）（“老集市”）。\n===中世纪===\n约1300年时的伦敦地图\n农民起义的结局：起义领袖瓦特·泰勒被伦敦市市长William Walworth刺死\n1066年征服者威廉在黑斯廷斯战役取胜后，即向伦敦进军，一直到与伦敦城隔河相望的南华克，但遭到伦敦守军抵抗无法通过伦敦桥。他转道上游瓦灵福德过河，并一路掠夺。无意继续抵抗的显贵者埃德加、Edwin, Earl of Mercia及Morcar在伯克翰斯德向威廉投降。威廉在1075年授予伦敦城君主制诰，表明伦敦城是英格兰当时少数几个保留一些自治权力的城市之一。威廉治下编纂的《末日审判书》没有覆盖伦敦城。\n威廉在伦敦建造三座城堡以控制伦敦市民：\n* 伦敦塔\n* Baynard's Castle\n* Montfichet's Tower\n1130年前后，亨利一世准许伦敦市民自行推举两名郡长，并同时管辖米德塞克斯：这意味著伦敦市和米德塞克斯郡直到《Local Government Act 1888》颁布实际是作为同一行政区管辖的（郡不是市的附庸）。到1141年，整个市民集体被认为是一个社群，这一市民“公社”后来发展成为伦敦市法团，伦敦市民在1189年获得国王准许推举市长，并从1215年开始直接选举市长。新的市长职位代替郡长成为市首长，原先的郡长成为次要官职。\n伦敦市自古即分为25个坊（Ward），每一坊推举一位参议（Alderman），参议负责主持至今都每年举行的Wardmote（Wardmote）。此外，过去还有在圣保罗座堂外的十字处举行全体市民会议（Folkmoot）的习惯。中世纪的许多职位和传统都传承至今，这也显示伦敦市和法团的特殊性质。\n1381年的农民起义波及伦敦。叛军占领伦敦城和伦敦塔，但叛乱在其领袖瓦特·泰勒在伦敦市市长William Walworth参与的一次冲突中被杀后结束。\n“木刻本”伦敦地图，1560年代\n1666年伦敦大火影响区域图，此次大火烧毁全城的近80%\n17世纪油画中的1666年大火：画面是从接近伦敦塔码头的船上望向旧伦敦桥、教堂、房屋及伦敦塔\n伦敦城屡次受到严重火灾，其中最大的是1123年和（更出名的）1666年伦敦大火。这两次火灾都曾直接被称为”大火灾“。1666年火灾之后，曾有一系列计划对城区进行重新规划并将其道路网改造成以规划街区、广场和林荫道构成的文艺复兴式城市。但这些计划几乎完全没有得到实行，伦敦城的中世纪道路格局大体保留至今。\n===近代早期===\n到16世纪末，伦敦已逐渐成为重要的银行业、国际贸易和商业中心。1565年，托马斯·格雷沙姆爵士创立皇家交易所，成为伦敦商人的重要集中点，并在1571年获得皇家赦诏。虽然这一建筑现在已移作他用，但它位于康希尔街与针线街交汇口的位置（银行交叉口）现在仍是伦敦市的主要产业银行业和金融服务业的地理重心点。英国央行英格兰银行在1734年搬到针线街上、皇家交易所对面的现址。而从1691年起坐落于康希尔往南的朗伯德街的Lloyd's Coffe House则发展成为全球领先的保险交易市场劳合社。伦敦保险业的中心仍在此地区，特别是石灰街坊。\n1708年，克里斯多佛·雷恩的杰作、圣保罗座堂在他生日那天完工，但教堂在十年前的1697年12月2日就已第一次举行仪式。新的圣保罗座堂建筑代替在1666年大火中焚毁的旧圣保罗教堂。新教堂被认为是英国最精美的教堂之一，是巴洛克建筑的极佳代表作。\n===伦敦的扩张===\n18世纪是伦敦迅速扩张的时代，反映同时代全国人口增加、工业革命的萌芽、以及伦敦作为开始发展的大英帝国中心的功能。伦敦的城镇区域蔓延到伦敦城外，特别是（在这一阶段）往伦敦西区和西敏寺方向发展。\n19世纪初，伦敦继续扩张，且扩张速度越来越快，并向四周发展。在伦敦城的东面，伦敦港在19世纪中迅速发展，由於伦敦城内的泰晤士河流域已无法接纳贸易的规模，因此建造许多新的港区。由于铁路和伦敦地铁的到来，伦敦能够扩张到前所未有的规模。到了19世纪中叶，伦敦的人口和面积仍然在迅速增长，而伦敦城已成为大都会中的一小部分。\n===19至20世纪===\n1894年，英国政府设立“Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London”，研究将伦敦市与四周的伦敦郡（1889年成立）合并，但由于西敏中央政府轮替此建议没有实施。因此，伦敦市虽然地处伦敦都市以内，并且之前之后英国屡次改革地方政府结构，但伦敦市作为政体仍被保留下来。为了反映伦敦市的政治地位，伦敦市自为一个下议院选区，在Unreformed House of Commons中选举四名议员，在《1832年人民代表法令》的改革中仍然保留，但在《Redistribution of Seats Act 1885》中减少为两名。伦敦市作为独立下议院选区的历史在《Representation of the People Act 1948》实行后结束，此后伦敦市地界属伦敦及西敏两市选区，在该选区中人口和面积都属少数部分。\n圣保罗座堂，1896年\n19世纪，随著伦敦市民开始往郊区迁徙，伦敦城的人口开始快速减少，并在20世纪大大多数时期维持此趋势。许多居住用房屋被拆除，改建办公楼。第二次世界大战中，伦敦城和伦敦其他地方以及其他英国城市一样，受到大规模的、破坏极大的炸弹空袭，特别是伦敦大轰炸。虽然圣保罗座堂幸免于难，但伦敦市的大片区域没有躲过轰炸，其中1940年12月的一次特别猛烈的空袭导致烽火爆，被称为“Second Great Fire of London”。\n战后的数十年间有过一套大型重建计划，一些部分（例如巴比肯计划较大的改变城市环境。历史环境被摧毁的地方在战后得以建造现代的大型开发项目，而在在轰炸破坏影响较小的地方伦敦城则保留较古老的小型建筑风格。城里的道路网大致保留中世纪的格局，小部受到改变，等近年又有消除战后现代主义改变、回复过去格局的趋势，例如在主祷文广场的改建项目。\n20世纪70年代，伦敦城开始建造高层办公楼，其中包括m高、47层的国民西敏大厦，这是英国的第一座摩天大楼。近年来，办公空间的建设愈发兴旺，特别是在城区的中、北和东部，建成的摩天大楼包括圣玛莉艾克斯30号大楼（“小黄瓜”）、宽门大厦、利德贺大楼（“起司刨”）、芬乔奇街20号（“对讲机”）及伦敦市的最高建筑苍鹭大厦，在建的摩天大楼则包括主教门22号。\n城中现在的主要居民区域是巴比肯屋村，建于1965年至1976年之间。伦敦博物馆和伦敦市法团提供的一些其他公共服务设施也在屋村内。\n==政治==\n市政厅（Guildhall）是伦敦市的仪式和行政中心\n市长官邸（Mansion House）是伦敦市市长的官邸\nJohn Stuttard在2006年的伦敦市长巡游上\n伦敦市具有特殊的政治地位，这是由于它自从盎格鲁-撒克逊时代一直保留的独立建制，以及它与君主之间独一无二的特殊关系所造成的。历史上，伦敦市的政治制度在英国城市中并不罕见，但（不同于其他城市）它没有受《1835年市议会组织法令》影响，并在此后的改革中基本没有改变。\n伦敦市由伦敦市法团管理，法团的首长是伦敦市长大人（不同于近年设立的“伦敦市长”职位）。法团负有各种职责，且在伦敦市地界之外拥有土地。和其他英格兰地方政府不同，伦敦市法团有两个市议会机构：（现在基本仅具仪式性质的）Court of Aldermen（Court of Aldermen）和庶民会议（Court of Common Council）。参事会代表各坊（ward），每一坊无论大小选举一名参事（Alderman）。法团的首席行政官员担任古老的“Town Clerk of London职位。\n伦敦市同时是名誉郡，设以市长为首的郡尉代任专员（Commission of Lieutenancy）代替通常郡的郡尉（Lord-Lieutenant），并设两名郡长（Sheriff）代替通常郡的High Sheriff（High Sheriff）。“郡长”是由各同业公会（Livery Companie）任命的半司法性质的官员，而伦敦的同业公会则是古已有之的政治制度，原宗旨是代表和保护各行业。各同业公会的高级成员称为“Liveryman”（Liverymen），由这些会员组成的庶民大堂会议（Common Hall）选举市长、郡长和某些其它职位。\n===坊===\n伦敦市由25个坊（Ward）组成。“坊”的建制是中世纪行政制度的遗存，是由城市内很小的地方区域形成的自治单位。“坊”可以说是选区或政治区划，也可以说是仪式、地理和行政性质单位，或者可以说是市的区划。每一坊产生一名参事（Alderman）。直到20世纪60年代中期，参事是终身职位，但现在每六年会举行参事选举。每一坊有一名执事（Beadle），这一古老职位现在基本仅具仪式性功能，其主要职责是组织一年一度选举人、民意代表以及官员参加的Wardmote（Wardmote）。在坊民会议上，参事会任命下一年的一个或多个代理参事。每一坊还有一个坊民会所（Ward Club），其功能类似其他地方的Residents' association。\n坊是自古就有的，在法律追溯的年代中，坊的数量有过三次增减：\n*1394年法灵顿分为“内法灵顿”和“外法灵顿”；\n*1550年，位于泰晤士河南岸的外桥坊建立，原桥坊改为内桥坊；及\n*1978年，内外桥坊合并为Bridge (ward)。\n19世纪末时的各坊分布图\n2003年以来的各坊分布图\n1994年伦敦市的辖区界线进行修改，此后市内的工商选票机制又进行改革，因此在2003年对各坊的辖区和选举代表配额都进行较大的修改。2010年各坊的边界又经审查并有修改，但幅度没有2003年的大，新的划界从2013年开始实施。边界审查由法团的资深官员和老贝利的资深法官主持。对坊区的修改旨在避免malapportionment。伦敦市的坊区审查机制也是在英国独一无二的：其他地方的所有选区或坊区都是每8至12年由英国选举委员会或地方政府划界委员会定期审查的。历史上，各坊与特定的教堂、同业公会会所和其他历史建筑有关联：例如贝纳得堡和圣保罗座堂、桥坊和伦敦桥等，但2003年的划界修改后失去一部分这些历史性关系。\n每一坊选举一名参事参加伦敦市法团的Court of Aldermen、数名庶民代表（Commoners）（等于其它地方的市议员）参加法团的庶民会议（Court of Common Council）。选民须具有Freeman of the City of London身份方可有被选举权。每一坊选举的庶民代表人数由两名到十名不等，取决于该坊的选民人数。2003年的边界审查后，决定四个居民较多的坊（Portsoken、Queenhithe、Aldersgate及Cripplegate）应选举产生100名庶民代表中的20名，而其他的主要为工商业的坊则选举产生80名。2003年和2013年的划界修改增强这四个坊的居民区性质。\n人口普查数据中，在伦敦市辖境定义八个坊区，其面积和人口不等。这些人口普查使用的坊区不时修改，其中的四个囊括“平方英里”的67%面积和86%的人口。这四个坊区都是根据四个行政坊命名和定义的：\n===选举===\n伦敦市有独特的选举制度。伦敦市的选民大多数是位于城内的工商企业和其他机构。各坊的选民人数非常不均匀。选举时，城内的企业和居民都有投票权。\n《1835年市议会组织法令》没有对伦敦市法团进行改革，因为当时它的选举基础已比全国其他区市都要广泛。此后，伦敦市法团通过自身立法规定市民不须成为同业公会会员即可获得自由市民资格，因此更加扩展了选举基础。伦敦市在1801年时人口约为130,000，但随著它向中心商务区的发展，在二战后人口一度跌至5,000，现在主要由于巴比肯屋村的建设回升到约9,000。而2009年时的工商业票数则为约24,000，远大于居民选民数。由於伦敦市法团没有受到此后的屡次地方政府改革立法影响，因此它的选举制度比起其它地方愈发特别。在区市选举中独一无二的是，伦敦市的竞选人基本仍由无党派独立人士占多数。\n英国其他地方政府议会选举中的工商业或“non-residential vote”被《1969年人民代表法令》取消，但在伦敦市得以保留。历届英国政府保留这一工商业代表机制的理由是伦敦城“主要是做生意的地方”。伦敦市有约330,000非居民构成白天人口，是大多数地方政府服务的使用者，远超出居民人数（2011年时约为7,000人）。反之，保留工商业选票的反对者则认为这一机制使伦敦市产生机构性惯性（是改革的阻力）。\n《2002年伦敦市（坊选举）法令》（国会通过的非公共法令）改革伦敦市的选举制度，大幅增加工商业选举基础范围，使得更多的企业得到代表。根据新的制度，非居民选民从16,000人翻一番到32,000人。之前没有选票的企业（和其他机构）和以前可以提名选举人的企业一样得以提名选举人，所有机构都必须以具代表性的方法选择选举人。雇佣少于10人的企业可以任命一名选举人，雇佣10到50人的可以每5名雇员任命一名选举人，雇佣50人以上的可以任命10名选举人，超出50名的每五名雇员额外任命一名选举人。此法令同时也消除一些自19世纪50年代以来一直没有更改的特殊点。\n===圣殿===\n圣殿区域包括内殿与中殿，是两个自由地。自由地是旧时的一种区划，现在很少保存下来。他们是Extra-parochial area（不属于任一宗教或民政教区）。两区历史上不受伦敦市法团管制，并且现在管理两地的内殿、中殿两所律师学院也在大多数情况下仍被视为地方政府，而在宗教上两地也处在Bisohp of London的Ecclesiastical jurisdiction之外。两地在伦敦市的辖境内并属於伦敦市的自由地，但可以视为独立的飞地。两地同属于外法令顿坊。\n===其他职能===\n利德贺市场是位于恩典堂街和石灰街之间的历史性市场\n在市内，伦敦市法团拥有并运营史密斯菲尔德市场和利德贺市场。在其辖境之外，它也拥有地产，包括在大伦敦各处及周边的开阔地（包括公园、森林和公地），其中包括艾坪森林的大部和汉普斯特德荒野。此外，与伦敦市有著紧密联系的The Honourable The Irish Society在北爱尔兰也拥有许多公共土地。伦敦市法团拥有位于伦敦市辖境外、毗邻的塔村区的旧斯皮塔佛德市场和Billingsgate Fish Market。伦敦市还拥有英格兰及威尔士的中央刑事法庭老贝利，这一法庭原为伦敦市及米德塞克斯届审法庭，现在伦敦市仍旧负责其部分运营经费，作为对国家的馈赠。\n伦敦市拥有独立的警察部队伦敦市警察，市法团的庶民会议（主要的市议会）是伦敦市的police authority。而大伦敦其他地区的警务则由总部在新苏格兰场的都会警察队伍负责。\n伦敦市内有一座医院，圣巴多罗买医院，也称为“巴特”（Barts）。巴特医院建于1123年，位于史密斯菲尔德，90年代就继续使用此医院曾有质疑，现在正在进行改建工程。\n伦敦市是英国规模第三大的艺术资助机构。市法团监管巴比肯艺术中心并资助其他的重要表演艺术团体。\n市法团负责伦敦港卫生局（The London Port Health Authority）。伦敦港卫生局负责泰晤士河潮汐段的港务卫生事务，其中包括各个海港以及伦敦城市机场。市法团还监督Bridge House Estates的运作。桥屋信托负责维护伦敦桥、黑衣修士桥、南华克桥、塔桥及千禧桥。因此，虽然塔桥的两端都不在伦敦市界内，却悬挂伦敦市旗。\n===伦敦市的边界===\n历史上，伦敦市的规模被周边的防卫城池--伦敦城墙限制。伦敦城墙由罗马人在公元二世纪修建，用来保卫他们的战略港口城市。但随著市辖境的稍许扩张，现在的伦敦市边界并不和旧城墙吻合。中世纪时代中，伦敦市的边界曾向西扩张，越过早期居民点的西界弗利特河、沿着弗利特街到圣殿关。伦敦市也在其他方向扩展至原城墙外位于霍本、奥德斯门、主教门和阿尔德门等処的称为“城关”的关卡。这些都是入城的重要通道，因此控制这些入口对伦敦市维持对特定行业的特权起到重要作用。\n圣殿关的圣殿闩碑是伦敦市与西敏市之间的界碑\n城墙大部已消失，但小部分仍可见。在伦敦博物馆附近的一段城墙在1940年12月29日的伦敦大轰炸高潮中的一次轰炸中，由于炸弹摧毁附近的房屋而重见天日。此外，在St Alphage London Wall附近有一段城墙，在伦敦塔附近也有两段。而历史上的界河弗利特河在1666年的大火后改建为运河，此后逐段被掩盖，自18世纪起成为伦敦的“失踪的河川”之一，现在是地下的泄洪渠。\n伦敦城的传统边界线直到1994年4月1日才受到少许改变，城界往西、北、东稍许拓展，从毗邻的西敏市、卡姆登、伊斯灵顿、哈克尼及塔村各区划入稍许地界。这些更改的主要目的是厘清由于城市地理的改变而已过时的边界界线。在此过程中也有少许伦敦城的辖境划入其他区，但总体来说城界有所增加（城界面积从1.05平方英里增加到1.12平方英里）。其中最重要的是此次划境将当时新开发的Broadgate全部划入城界。\n城区以南、隔泰晤士河相望的南华克在1550年至1899年之间曾属城界，划为“外桥坊”（Ward of Bridge Without）。这一归属与皇家将此处的“Guildable Manor”授予伦敦市有关。随著伦敦跨都市的政府职能伸入附近地区，伦敦市在此区域的行政职责实际上在维多利亚时代中叶就已消失。现在南华克是大伦敦南华克区的一部分。此外，城东的伦敦塔一直在伦敦市的辖境之外，而属于塔村区。\n===纹章、格言、市旗===\n饰于鞍褥上的伦敦市纹章（摄于2011年市长迅游时，皇家司法院外）\n伦敦市法团拥有achievement (heraldry)级别的纹章，其组成部分包括饰有纹徽的盾章、位于盾章上方的头盔上的crest (heraldry)、两旁的supporters，以及盾章下方卷轴上的格言。\n这一纹章在纹章院有“古老记录”。纹章是银色盾章，上饰有红色十字，第一个四分格中有一把竖立的红色剑。这一纹徽结合英格兰和伦敦市的两位主保圣人的标志：圣佐治十字及象征圣保罗殉教的标志。红剑常被误认为是象征伦敦市长沃尔沃斯杀死农民大起义领袖瓦特·泰勒时用的短刀，但实际上纹章在泰勒被杀前数月就已开始使用，说剑的图案代表沃尔沃斯的短刀的说法则要到17世纪晚期才出现。\n伦敦市的拉丁语格言是“Domine dirige nos”，意思是“主，引领我们”。有迹象显示此格言在17世纪开始使用，最早记录的使用是在1633年。\n伦敦市的市旗是以市法团盾徽上的纹徽为图案的banner of arms。\n== 地理 ==\n伦敦市在英格兰名誉郡中论面积和人口都是最小的郡，论人口密度则排名第四。在英格兰的326个区中，伦敦市的人口是第二少的（最少的是锡利群岛），面积则是最小的。它也是英格兰的各市中人口最少的（在全英国则有两个威尔士的市人口更少）。\n城区的高度从最低的海平面（泰晤士河畔）到最高的海拔ft（在霍本高街（High Holborn）和法院巷转角）不等。历史城区中有两个山丘，规模很小但具历史意义：城西的卢德门丘（Ludgate Hill）和城东的谷丘（Cornhill）。两丘之间流淌著River_Walbrook，现今在地下流淌的伦敦“消失的河流”之一（附近的弗利特河也是一条地下河）。\n==人口==\n据英国国家统计署统计，2011年时伦敦市的人口是7,375人，比2001年上一次人口普查时的人口数略有增加，统计署估计2016年中的人口是9,401人。2001年人口普查时的居民民族组成是：84.6% 白人，6.8%南亚裔，2.6%黑人，2.3%混血人，2.0%华人以及1.7%“其他民族”。右列的是自1801年以来的人口数量变迁（根据10年一度的人口普查数据）。19实际上半叶伦敦市的人口大约维持在120,000至140,000人口，但在1851至1991年之间持续大幅下降，直到1991年至2001之间又有小幅增长。这一时间段中伦敦城衹有1994年有显著的边界改变。\n伦敦市的全职工作人口的每周毛收入比大伦敦及大不列颠岛（英格兰、威尔士、苏格兰）总体要高许多：伦敦市的中位收入是£773.30，大伦敦是£598.60，大不列颠是£491.00。男女两性之间的收入有较大的差别:男性是£1,085.90，女性£653.50。2001年人口普查数据显示伦敦市在英格兰和威尔士各区中有特殊性质：伦敦市的人口增长比例、一人户型、学位或更高级别的学历、以及拥挤程度都是最高的；拥有小汽车或面包车、坐汽车上班、已婚夫妇户型比例、以及每户平均人口（1.58人）都是最低的。此外，它还是大伦敦地区中无宗教信仰人口和就业人口最高的区。\n==特殊地位==\n伦敦市由一个非常特殊的自治团体「伦敦市法团」（City of London Corporation）管理。该市的座右铭「Domine dirige nos」在拉丁文中意指「主，引领我们」。\n虽然伦敦市是大伦敦区的一部分，且参与大伦敦议会和大伦敦市长的选举，但在一些方面仍保持它的特殊独立地位。例如：代表君王象征性监督大伦敦的大伦敦郡尉的辖区包括整个大伦敦但不包括伦敦市；伦敦市的警务由独立的伦敦市警察（City of London Police）负责，而大伦敦其他地区则由伦敦都市警察（Metropolitan Police Service）负责。\n作为仪式上的郡级单位，伦敦市有独立于大伦敦的郡尉设置，但根据传统伦敦市郡尉不是一人专任，而是由委员会代任。伦敦市市长是郡尉代任专员之首。\n管辖整个英格兰和威尔士的中央刑事法院位于伦敦市境内。历史上中央刑事法院最早是伦敦市市长的公堂，后来才由英国政府为了维持司法公正而将辖区扩展至整个英格兰和威尔士。因此至今中央刑事法院驻地老贝利的产权仍为伦敦市法团所有，并且整个法院的运作都由伦敦市法团出资并管理。\n==地标==\n===历史建筑===\n大轰炸和二战后的重建，意味着尽管这座城市有着悠久的历史，但完整的历史建筑却比人们预期的要少。尽管如此，仍有许多（主要是维多利亚时代和爱德华时代）的精美建筑，典型的是历史主义建筑和新古典主义风格。这些建筑包括伦敦大火纪念碑、圣保罗座堂、市政厅、皇家交易所、约翰逊博士之家（Dr. Johnson's House）、市长勋爵官邸和众多教堂，许多都是由克里斯多佛·雷恩爵士设计，他还设计了圣保罗座堂。圣殿区域曾遭受严重轰炸，幸存建筑包括王座步道2号（2 King's Bench Walk）和亨利王子的房间，该地区已基本上重建为其历史形态。另一个被炸弹破坏的地方已修复的例子是霍尔本（Holborn）的斯台普酒店（Staple Inn）。罗马伦敦城墙还存在一小段，例如在伦敦塔附近和巴比肯地区。二十世纪的登录建筑有布拉肯大厦（Bracken House），这是该国二战后第一个受到法定保护的建筑，以及整个巴比肯屋村和金巷屋村（Golden Lane Estate）。\n伦敦塔不在伦敦城内，但却是一个著名的旅游景点，将游客带到伦敦城东南部。其他具有历史意义的地标性建筑包括英格兰银行、老贝利街、海关大楼、史密斯菲尔德市场、利德贺市场和圣巴多罗买医院。值得注意的当代建筑包括劳埃德大厦等许多现代高层建筑。\n英格兰银行（左）和皇家交易所（中）是伦敦金融城众多重要建筑中的两座。\n=== 高层建筑 ===\n2021年伦敦城天际线，包括芬乔奇街20号、利德贺大楼、圣玛莉艾克斯30号大楼和伦敦城最高建筑主教门22号，左下角为伦敦桥\n参见：伦敦最高建筑列表\n伦敦城的高层建筑和摩天大楼越来越多，主要由金融行业使用。几乎所有高层建筑都位于伦敦城的金融中心，主教门、利德贺街和芬丘奇街的东侧。北部有一个较小的建筑群，包括巴比肯屋村的三座高层住宅楼和Citypoint商业楼。2007年，高abbr=on的Drapers'Gardens大楼被拆除，取而代之的是一座较矮的塔楼。\n伦敦城高度超过100米的建筑有：\n时间线\n该市最高建筑的时间线如下：\n==

London），音译作西堤区，又称为-{zh-cn:伦敦市; zh-tw:伦敦城; zh-hk:伦敦城; zh-sg:伦敦城;}-或伦敦金融城（市法团使用的官方简体中文名称）Translate，是位于英国伦敦的一个市和郡。自从公元一世纪罗马人在此殖民起到中世纪，伦敦市一直涵盖伦敦的大部分，但到今天伦敦的城镇区域已扩张到远远大於伦敦市的地界。伦敦市现在只是大伦敦都会区的极小一部分，但仍是伦敦市中心的重要组成部分。伦敦市是大伦敦各区中两个拥有“城市”地位的区之一：另一个是与其隔邻的西敏市。\n在英语里，伦敦市的一个常用别称是“the City”（“城”，或仅称“City”——大写“C”与整个伦敦城市区分），此外由于其面积为abbr=on，又俗称“平方英里”（英文：Square Mile）。这两个名字都经常被用作整个英国的交易和金融服务业的代称，伦敦市作为这些行业的集中地，已有相当长久的历史。伦敦市法团在海外进行宣传时选用的官方简体中文名称“伦敦金融城”也强调其作为金融中心的角色。\n作为地名，“伦敦”现在通常指的是远大於伦敦市的地区。“伦敦”经常指整个伦敦大都市蔓延区，或所有32个伦敦自治市加上伦敦市本身。这种泛称的用法最早在16世纪便已出现。\n伦敦市的地方政府机构是伦敦市法团，其建制不同于英国其他的所有地方政府。伦敦市法团具有一些作为地方政府很特别的职责，例如它也是伦敦市的警务负责机构。此外，与多数地方政府不同，伦敦市法团的职责和财产延伸到其辖境以外。法团的首长是伦敦市市长（与大伦敦-{}-市长是两个不同的职位）。现任伦敦市市长（第63任）是Vincent Keaveny，2021年上任。\n伦敦市是重要的商业和金融中心。在19世纪，伦敦市曾是全世界最重要的商业中心，现在它仍是重要的商务聚汇点。根据2008年发布的Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index伦敦排名第一。伦敦市的东部是保险业聚集的中心。近年伦敦在伦敦市外又发展出第二个金融中心，即城东km的金丝雀码头商务区。\n伦敦市的常住人口约为9,401人（2016年中统计署估计），但有300,000人每天涌入城中工作。伦敦市内的工作岗位中有四分之三属于金融服务、专业服务（包括法律、会计等）以及相关工商业服务行业。伦敦市的西部和北部则是法律行业的中心，其中圣殿区域和法院巷地区是英国的四个大律师学院的所在地，其中中殿律师学院和内殿律师学院位於伦敦市的辖境内。\n==金融中心==\n今日的伦敦市是整个伦敦的商业与金融中心，与纽约市曼哈顿同样，对于全球金融业具有相当的领导地位。口语上，伦敦当地人习惯以「The City」称呼伦敦市，或称它为「平方英里」（Square Mile），之所以如此称呼除了是因为其面积正好约为1平方英里（2.6平方公里），“The City”这用法同时也成为英国、乃至欧洲金融业的别称，因为在大英帝国时代，全世界的金融服务业几乎是由聚集在这狭窄面积内的大小公司行号所控制，因而如此转喻。\n== 历史 ==\n===建立===\n在泰晤士河中发现的“滑铁卢头盔”，约公元前150–50年\n保存至今的伦敦城墙遗迹，约公元200年建造，位于塔丘\n过去的通用说法是“伦迪尼乌姆”（Londinium）最早是罗马占领不列颠的早期、公元47年左右，由泰晤士河上的商人在感潮河段建立的商港。但此年份仅是猜想：保存下来的罗马文献中没有记录在何时、为何在此建立城市。文献中第一次提到此城市是公元61年的塔西陀《编年史》，其中提到伦迪尼乌姆是被布狄卡领导的爱西尼部落洗劫的重要城镇之一。\n现在有许多历史学家认为伦敦最早是公元43年罗马征服不列颠以前建立的。这一论点的根据是考古证据和威尔士语传说文学。考古学家称已发现的最佳的铁器时代艺术品和金属制品中，有近一半是在伦敦地区发现的。其中最出名的例子之一是带角的“滑铁卢头盔”，于1860年代初发现，现藏于大英博物馆。而根据古代的威尔士传说，有一个名为“赫利之子勒德”的王，扩建位于伦敦当时已存在的定居点，因此这一地方此后以他的名字命名。同一传说还说勒德死后葬于后来伦敦城墙的勒德门地方。\n勒德（Llydd）是长子。其父王赫利·茂尔（Beli Mawr）驾崩后，勒德执掌全岛之政。他扩建伦戴恩（Llvndain）的城郭，在城外设立田庄，并全年大多住在城里。他在城内建造许多华丽的房屋，在各国都未曾见如此的房屋。他把这里叫作伦戴恩堡（Kaer Lvndain）。在外族侵入后，他们把这里叫做伦敦堡（Kaer Lwndwn）。\n—《威尔士语不列颠诸王史》（Ystorya Brenhined y Brytanyeit），耶稣学院藏抄本第五十六（Jesus MS. LXI）\n可以肯定的是，罗马人征服捕不列颠之后发展这里的定居点和河港，其中心大约在华尔溪（Walbrook，一条浅溪）汇入泰晤士河处。在公元60年城镇被布狄卡烧毁后，整个城镇被规划重建（成为规划市镇，或“civitas”）。新建的城镇有城墙围绕，经济繁荣，并在公元一世纪莫成为罗马不列颠行省的最大居民点。到二世纪，伦迪尼乌姆已替代卡姆罗多努（今科尔切斯特）成为省会。\n在其鼎盛时，罗马时代的伦敦人口达45,000–60,000人。罗马人在190年到225年之间建造伦敦城墙。罗马时的城市范围与今天的伦敦市范围近似，较大的区别是伦迪尼乌姆的西界没有超过勒德门和弗里特河以西，而且当时泰晤士河没有经过挖掘，比现在宽阔，所以当时城市的河岸比现在要往北。罗马人最早在公元50年建造跨河的桥，其位置在现在的伦敦桥附近。\n在今天的伦敦市内仍可看见一些罗马遗址和文物：例如一座London Mithraeum，伦敦城墙残段（位于巴比肯屋村及塔丘附近）、London Stone以及位于市政厅广场下的竞技场。伦敦博物馆藏有许多罗马时代的考古发现，常设关于罗马时代的展览，并有研究用的馆藏。\n===衰落===\n到伦敦城墙建成时，伦敦城已经开始步入衰弱，并受到瘟疫和火灾的困扰。罗马帝国经历漫长的动摇和衰弱，其中在不列颠发生Carausian Revolt。三到四世纪之间，伦敦城受到皮克特人、苏格兰人及萨克逊人的掠袭。伦迪尼乌姆和罗马帝国继续衰落，公元410年罗马军政机关撤离不列颠。此时，伦迪尼乌姆的许多罗马公共建筑已经废弃，在罗马政府正式撤离后，整个城市逐渐被废弃，在接下来的数世纪中，伦敦城几乎（有时完全）无人居住。萨克逊人开始迁入这一地区后，他们的贸易和人口中心从伦迪尼乌姆城池内转移到城外西郊的Lundenwic（“伦敦集市”），其位置大约在今天的河岸街、奥德维奇、柯芬园地区。\n===盎格鲁·撒克逊时代的重建===\n在盎格鲁·撒克逊七国时代，伦敦地区先后由埃塞克斯、麦西亚、和威塞克斯王国所控制，但从八世纪中叶起不断的受到维京人的威胁或者控制。\n南华克桥附近的纪念牌，纪念阿尔弗雷德大王在伦敦重建居民点\n据贝德记录，公元604年圣奥斯定祝圣默利图斯为东撒克逊人及其王Sæberht of Essex的第一任主教。赛博特的领主和舅父、肯特王国国王Æthelberht of Kent在伦敦建造一座教堂，主保圣人为圣保罗，作为新主教的座堂。通常认为（但没有确凿证据证明）这座教堂的位置就是后来的圣保罗座堂所在地。\n威塞克斯国王阿尔弗雷德大王可以说是第一个“英格兰人”的国王，他在886年在反攻维京人统治区域的战争中占领罗马帝国时代的城池，并开始在此殖民。他把女婿埃塞尔雷德任命为麦西亚（Mercia）郡长（伯爵）、守卫这一地区。重新设防的盎格鲁·撒克逊时代城池称为“Lundenburh”。历史学家亚瑟（Asser）这样写道：“阿尔弗雷德，盎格鲁·撒克逊人之王，华丽地修复伦敦城......并将其恢复至可以住人的情况。”阿尔弗雷德的“修复”工作主要包括重新启用及修饰几乎无人居住的罗马城池、在泰晤士河沿岸修筑堤岸，以及重新规划城内道路格局。\n阿尔弗雷德重夺伦敦并重建罗马城池不仅是伦敦城建城史上的转折点，也是早期英格兰统一化的重要时刻，从这一时期起，威塞克斯开始转化为英格兰的主要王国，同时在一定程度上抵抗维京人的占领和掠袭。虽然伦敦和英格兰的其他部分在此后仍经常遭受维京人和丹麦人的掠袭和占领，最终伦敦城和英格兰王国成功建立并保持下来。\n到10世纪，埃塞尔斯坦准许在伦敦设立八所铸币厰，而在当时的首都温彻斯特只有六所，证明当时伦敦的财富。 罗马人撤退并放弃伦迪尼乌姆后伦敦桥已被废弃，经撒克逊人修复，但还是屡次被维京人和风暴摧毁。\n随著贸易和人口中心迁回罗马时代的城池内，之前的撒克逊人的居民点伦敦威克几乎完全废弃，开始称为“厄得威克”（Ealdwic）（“老镇”），现在演变成西敏市接近伦敦市交界处的地名和路名奥德维奇（Aldwych）（“老集市”）。\n===中世纪===\n约1300年时的伦敦地图\n农民起义的结局：起义领袖瓦特·泰勒被伦敦市市长William Walworth刺死\n1066年征服者威廉在黑斯廷斯战役取胜后，即向伦敦进军，一直到与伦敦城隔河相望的南华克，但遭到伦敦守军抵抗无法通过伦敦桥。他转道上游瓦灵福德过河，并一路掠夺。无意继续抵抗的显贵者埃德加、Edwin, Earl of Mercia及Morcar在伯克翰斯德向威廉投降。威廉在1075年授予伦敦城君主制诰，表明伦敦城是英格兰当时少数几个保留一些自治权力的城市之一。威廉治下编纂的《末日审判书》没有覆盖伦敦城。\n威廉在伦敦建造三座城堡以控制伦敦市民：\n* 伦敦塔\n* Baynard's Castle\n* Montfichet's Tower\n1130年前后，亨利一世准许伦敦市民自行推举两名郡长，并同时管辖米德塞克斯：这意味著伦敦市和米德塞克斯郡直到《Local Government Act 1888》颁布实际是作为同一行政区管辖的（郡不是市的附庸）。到1141年，整个市民集体被认为是一个社群，这一市民“公社”后来发展成为伦敦市法团，伦敦市民在1189年获得国王准许推举市长，并从1215年开始直接选举市长。新的市长职位代替郡长成为市首长，原先的郡长成为次要官职。\n伦敦市自古即分为25个坊（Ward），每一坊推举一位参议（Alderman），参议负责主持至今都每年举行的Wardmote（Wardmote）。此外，过去还有在圣保罗座堂外的十字处举行全体市民会议（Folkmoot）的习惯。中世纪的许多职位和传统都传承至今，这也显示伦敦市和法团的特殊性质。\n1381年的农民起义波及伦敦。叛军占领伦敦城和伦敦塔，但叛乱在其领袖瓦特·泰勒在伦敦市市长William Walworth参与的一次冲突中被杀后结束。\n“木刻本”伦敦地图，1560年代\n1666年伦敦大火影响区域图，此次大火烧毁全城的近80%\n17世纪油画中的1666年大火：画面是从接近伦敦塔码头的船上望向旧伦敦桥、教堂、房屋及伦敦塔\n伦敦城屡次受到严重火灾，其中最大的是1123年和（更出名的）1666年伦敦大火。这两次火灾都曾直接被称为”大火灾“。1666年火灾之后，曾有一系列计划对城区进行重新规划并将其道路网改造成以规划街区、广场和林荫道构成的文艺复兴式城市。但这些计划几乎完全没有得到实行，伦敦城的中世纪道路格局大体保留至今。\n===近代早期===\n到16世纪末，伦敦已逐渐成为重要的银行业、国际贸易和商业中心。1565年，托马斯·格雷沙姆爵士创立皇家交易所，成为伦敦商人的重要集中点，并在1571年获得皇家赦诏。虽然这一建筑现在已移作他用，但它位于康希尔街与针线街交汇口的位置（银行交叉口）现在仍是伦敦市的主要产业银行业和金融服务业的地理重心点。英国央行英格兰银行在1734年搬到针线街上、皇家交易所对面的现址。而从1691年起坐落于康希尔往南的朗伯德街的Lloyd's Coffe House则发展成为全球领先的保险交易市场劳合社。伦敦保险业的中心仍在此地区，特别是石灰街坊。\n1708年，克里斯多佛·雷恩的杰作、圣保罗座堂在他生日那天完工，但教堂在十年前的1697年12月2日就已第一次举行仪式。新的圣保罗座堂建筑代替在1666年大火中焚毁的旧圣保罗教堂。新教堂被认为是英国最精美的教堂之一，是巴洛克建筑的极佳代表作。\n===伦敦的扩张===\n18世纪是伦敦迅速扩张的时代，反映同时代全国人口增加、工业革命的萌芽、以及伦敦作为开始发展的大英帝国中心的功能。伦敦的城镇区域蔓延到伦敦城外，特别是（在这一阶段）往伦敦西区和西敏寺方向发展。\n19世纪初，伦敦继续扩张，且扩张速度越来越快，并向四周发展。在伦敦城的东面，伦敦港在19世纪中迅速发展，由於伦敦城内的泰晤士河流域已无法接纳贸易的规模，因此建造许多新的港区。由于铁路和伦敦地铁的到来，伦敦能够扩张到前所未有的规模。到了19世纪中叶，伦敦的人口和面积仍然在迅速增长，而伦敦城已成为大都会中的一小部分。\n===19至20世纪===\n1894年，英国政府设立“Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London”，研究将伦敦市与四周的伦敦郡（1889年成立）合并，但由于西敏中央政府轮替此建议没有实施。因此，伦敦市虽然地处伦敦都市以内，并且之前之后英国屡次改革地方政府结构，但伦敦市作为政体仍被保留下来。为了反映伦敦市的政治地位，伦敦市自为一个下议院选区，在Unreformed House of Commons中选举四名议员，在《1832年人民代表法令》的改革中仍然保留，但在《Redistribution of Seats Act 1885》中减少为两名。伦敦市作为独立下议院选区的历史在《Representation of the People Act 1948》实行后结束，此后伦敦市地界属伦敦及西敏两市选区，在该选区中人口和面积都属少数部分。\n圣保罗座堂，1896年\n19世纪，随著伦敦市民开始往郊区迁徙，伦敦城的人口开始快速减少，并在20世纪大大多数时期维持此趋势。许多居住用房屋被拆除，改建办公楼。第二次世界大战中，伦敦城和伦敦其他地方以及其他英国城市一样，受到大规模的、破坏极大的炸弹空袭，特别是伦敦大轰炸。虽然圣保罗座堂幸免于难，但伦敦市的大片区域没有躲过轰炸，其中1940年12月的一次特别猛烈的空袭导致烽火爆，被称为“Second Great Fire of London”。\n战后的数十年间有过一套大型重建计划，一些部分（例如巴比肯计划较大的改变城市环境。历史环境被摧毁的地方在战后得以建造现代的大型开发项目，而在在轰炸破坏影响较小的地方伦敦城则保留较古老的小型建筑风格。城里的道路网大致保留中世纪的格局，小部受到改变，等近年又有消除战后现代主义改变、回复过去格局的趋势，例如在主祷文广场的改建项目。\n20世纪70年代，伦敦城开始建造高层办公楼，其中包括m高、47层的国民西敏大厦，这是英国的第一座摩天大楼。近年来，办公空间的建设愈发兴旺，特别是在城区的中、北和东部，建成的摩天大楼包括圣玛莉艾克斯30号大楼（“小黄瓜”）、宽门大厦、利德贺大楼（“起司刨”）、芬乔奇街20号（“对讲机”）及伦敦市的最高建筑苍鹭大厦，在建的摩天大楼则包括主教门22号。\n城中现在的主要居民区域是巴比肯屋村，建于1965年至1976年之间。伦敦博物馆和伦敦市法团提供的一些其他公共服务设施也在屋村内。\n==政治==\n市政厅（Guildhall）是伦敦市的仪式和行政中心\n市长官邸（Mansion House）是伦敦市市长的官邸\nJohn Stuttard在2006年的伦敦市长巡游上\n伦敦市具有特殊的政治地位，这是由于它自从盎格鲁-撒克逊时代一直保留的独立建制，以及它与君主之间独一无二的特殊关系所造成的。历史上，伦敦市的政治制度在英国城市中并不罕见，但（不同于其他城市）它没有受《1835年市议会组织法令》影响，并在此后的改革中基本没有改变。\n伦敦市由伦敦市法团管理，法团的首长是伦敦市长大人（不同于近年设立的“伦敦市长”职位）。法团负有各种职责，且在伦敦市地界之外拥有土地。和其他英格兰地方政府不同，伦敦市法团有两个市议会机构：（现在基本仅具仪式性质的）Court of Aldermen（Court of Aldermen）和庶民会议（Court of Common Council）。参事会代表各坊（ward），每一坊无论大小选举一名参事（Alderman）。法团的首席行政官员担任古老的“Town Clerk of London职位。\n伦敦市同时是名誉郡，设以市长为首的郡尉代任专员（Commission of Lieutenancy）代替通常郡的郡尉（Lord-Lieutenant），并设两名郡长（Sheriff）代替通常郡的High Sheriff（High Sheriff）。“郡长”是由各同业公会（Livery Companie）任命的半司法性质的官员，而伦敦的同业公会则是古已有之的政治制度，原宗旨是代表和保护各行业。各同业公会的高级成员称为“Liveryman”（Liverymen），由这些会员组成的庶民大堂会议（Common Hall）选举市长、郡长和某些其它职位。\n===坊===\n伦敦市由25个坊（Ward）组成。“坊”的建制是中世纪行政制度的遗存，是由城市内很小的地方区域形成的自治单位。“坊”可以说是选区或政治区划，也可以说是仪式、地理和行政性质单位，或者可以说是市的区划。每一坊产生一名参事（Alderman）。直到20世纪60年代中期，参事是终身职位，但现在每六年会举行参事选举。每一坊有一名执事（Beadle），这一古老职位现在基本仅具仪式性功能，其主要职责是组织一年一度选举人、民意代表以及官员参加的Wardmote（Wardmote）。在坊民会议上，参事会任命下一年的一个或多个代理参事。每一坊还有一个坊民会所（Ward Club），其功能类似其他地方的Residents' association。\n坊是自古就有的，在法律追溯的年代中，坊的数量有过三次增减：\n*1394年法灵顿分为“内法灵顿”和“外法灵顿”；\n*1550年，位于泰晤士河南岸的外桥坊建立，原桥坊改为内桥坊；及\n*1978年，内外桥坊合并为Bridge (ward)。\n19世纪末时的各坊分布图\n2003年以来的各坊分布图\n1994年伦敦市的辖区界线进行修改，此后市内的工商选票机制又进行改革，因此在2003年对各坊的辖区和选举代表配额都进行较大的修改。2010年各坊的边界又经审查并有修改，但幅度没有2003年的大，新的划界从2013年开始实施。边界审查由法团的资深官员和老贝利的资深法官主持。对坊区的修改旨在避免malapportionment。伦敦市的坊区审查机制也是在英国独一无二的：其他地方的所有选区或坊区都是每8至12年由英国选举委员会或地方政府划界委员会定期审查的。历史上，各坊与特定的教堂、同业公会会所和其他历史建筑有关联：例如贝纳得堡和圣保罗座堂、桥坊和伦敦桥等，但2003年的划界修改后失去一部分这些历史性关系。\n每一坊选举一名参事参加伦敦市法团的Court of Aldermen、数名庶民代表（Commoners）（等于其它地方的市议员）参加法团的庶民会议（Court of Common Council）。选民须具有Freeman of the City of London身份方可有被选举权。每一坊选举的庶民代表人数由两名到十名不等，取决于该坊的选民人数。2003年的边界审查后，决定四个居民较多的坊（Portsoken、Queenhithe、Aldersgate及Cripplegate）应选举产生100名庶民代表中的20名，而其他的主要为工商业的坊则选举产生80名。2003年和2013年的划界修改增强这四个坊的居民区性质。\n人口普查数据中，在伦敦市辖境定义八个坊区，其面积和人口不等。这些人口普查使用的坊区不时修改，其中的四个囊括“平方英里”的67%面积和86%的人口。这四个坊区都是根据四个行政坊命名和定义的：\n===选举===\n伦敦市有独特的选举制度。伦敦市的选民大多数是位于城内的工商企业和其他机构。各坊的选民人数非常不均匀。选举时，城内的企业和居民都有投票权。\n《1835年市议会组织法令》没有对伦敦市法团进行改革，因为当时它的选举基础已比全国其他区市都要广泛。此后，伦敦市法团通过自身立法规定市民不须成为同业公会会员即可获得自由市民资格，因此更加扩展了选举基础。伦敦市在1801年时人口约为130,000，但随著它向中心商务区的发展，在二战后人口一度跌至5,000，现在主要由于巴比肯屋村的建设回升到约9,000。而2009年时的工商业票数则为约24,000，远大于居民选民数。由於伦敦市法团没有受到此后的屡次地方政府改革立法影响，因此它的选举制度比起其它地方愈发特别。在区市选举中独一无二的是，伦敦市的竞选人基本仍由无党派独立人士占多数。\n英国其他地方政府议会选举中的工商业或“non-residential vote”被《1969年人民代表法令》取消，但在伦敦市得以保留。历届英国政府保留这一工商业代表机制的理由是伦敦城“主要是做生意的地方”。伦敦市有约330,000非居民构成白天人口，是大多数地方政府服务的使用者，远超出居民人数（2011年时约为7,000人）。反之，保留工商业选票的反对者则认为这一机制使伦敦市产生机构性惯性（是改革的阻力）。\n《2002年伦敦市（坊选举）法令》（国会通过的非公共法令）改革伦敦市的选举制度，大幅增加工商业选举基础范围，使得更多的企业得到代表。根据新的制度，非居民选民从16,000人翻一番到32,000人。之前没有选票的企业（和其他机构）和以前可以提名选举人的企业一样得以提名选举人，所有机构都必须以具代表性的方法选择选举人。雇佣少于10人的企业可以任命一名选举人，雇佣10到50人的可以每5名雇员任命一名选举人，雇佣50人以上的可以任命10名选举人，超出50名的每五名雇员额外任命一名选举人。此法令同时也消除一些自19世纪50年代以来一直没有更改的特殊点。\n===圣殿===\n圣殿区域包括内殿与中殿，是两个自由地。自由地是旧时的一种区划，现在很少保存下来。他们是Extra-parochial area（不属于任一宗教或民政教区）。两区历史上不受伦敦市法团管制，并且现在管理两地的内殿、中殿两所律师学院也在大多数情况下仍被视为地方政府，而在宗教上两地也处在Bisohp of London的Ecclesiastical jurisdiction之外。两地在伦敦市的辖境内并属於伦敦市的自由地，但可以视为独立的飞地。两地同属于外法令顿坊。\n===其他职能===\n利德贺市场是位于恩典堂街和石灰街之间的历史性市场\n在市内，伦敦市法团拥有并运营史密斯菲尔德市场和利德贺市场。在其辖境之外，它也拥有地产，包括在大伦敦各处及周边的开阔地（包括公园、森林和公地），其中包括艾坪森林的大部和汉普斯特德荒野。此外，与伦敦市有著紧密联系的The Honourable The Irish Society在北爱尔兰也拥有许多公共土地。伦敦市法团拥有位于伦敦市辖境外、毗邻的塔村区的旧斯皮塔佛德市场和Billingsgate Fish Market。伦敦市还拥有英格兰及威尔士的中央刑事法庭老贝利，这一法庭原为伦敦市及米德塞克斯届审法庭，现在伦敦市仍旧负责其部分运营经费，作为对国家的馈赠。\n伦敦市拥有独立的警察部队伦敦市警察，市法团的庶民会议（主要的市议会）是伦敦市的police authority。而大伦敦其他地区的警务则由总部在新苏格兰场的都会警察队伍负责。\n伦敦市内有一座医院，圣巴多罗买医院，也称为“巴特”（Barts）。巴特医院建于1123年，位于史密斯菲尔德，90年代就继续使用此医院曾有质疑，现在正在进行改建工程。\n伦敦市是英国规模第三大的艺术资助机构。市法团监管巴比肯艺术中心并资助其他的重要表演艺术团体。\n市法团负责伦敦港卫生局（The London Port Health Authority）。伦敦港卫生局负责泰晤士河潮汐段的港务卫生事务，其中包括各个海港以及伦敦城市机场。市法团还监督Bridge House Estates的运作。桥屋信托负责维护伦敦桥、黑衣修士桥、南华克桥、塔桥及千禧桥。因此，虽然塔桥的两端都不在伦敦市界内，却悬挂伦敦市旗。\n===伦敦市的边界===\n历史上，伦敦市的规模被周边的防卫城池--伦敦城墙限制。伦敦城墙由罗马人在公元二世纪修建，用来保卫他们的战略港口城市。但随著市辖境的稍许扩张，现在的伦敦市边界并不和旧城墙吻合。中世纪时代中，伦敦市的边界曾向西扩张，越过早期居民点的西界弗利特河、沿着弗利特街到圣殿关。伦敦市也在其他方向扩展至原城墙外位于霍本、奥德斯门、主教门和阿尔德门等処的称为“城关”的关卡。这些都是入城的重要通道，因此控制这些入口对伦敦市维持对特定行业的特权起到重要作用。\n圣殿关的圣殿闩碑是伦敦市与西敏市之间的界碑\n城墙大部已消失，但小部分仍可见。在伦敦博物馆附近的一段城墙在1940年12月29日的伦敦大轰炸高潮中的一次轰炸中，由于炸弹摧毁附近的房屋而重见天日。此外，在St Alphage London Wall附近有一段城墙，在伦敦塔附近也有两段。而历史上的界河弗利特河在1666年的大火后改建为运河，此后逐段被掩盖，自18世纪起成为伦敦的“失踪的河川”之一，现在是地下的泄洪渠。\n伦敦城的传统边界线直到1994年4月1日才受到少许改变，城界往西、北、东稍许拓展，从毗邻的西敏市、卡姆登、伊斯灵顿、哈克尼及塔村各区划入稍许地界。这些更改的主要目的是厘清由于城市地理的改变而已过时的边界界线。在此过程中也有少许伦敦城的辖境划入其他区，但总体来说城界有所增加（城界面积从1.05平方英里增加到1.12平方英里）。其中最重要的是此次划境将当时新开发的Broadgate全部划入城界。\n城区以南、隔泰晤士河相望的南华克在1550年至1899年之间曾属城界，划为“外桥坊”（Ward of Bridge Without）。这一归属与皇家将此处的“Guildable Manor”授予伦敦市有关。随著伦敦跨都市的政府职能伸入附近地区，伦敦市在此区域的行政职责实际上在维多利亚时代中叶就已消失。现在南华克是大伦敦南华克区的一部分。此外，城东的伦敦塔一直在伦敦市的辖境之外，而属于塔村区。\n===纹章、格言、市旗===\n饰于鞍褥上的伦敦市纹章（摄于2011年市长迅游时，皇家司法院外）\n伦敦市法团拥有achievement (heraldry)级别的纹章，其组成部分包括饰有纹徽的盾章、位于盾章上方的头盔上的crest (heraldry)、两旁的supporters，以及盾章下方卷轴上的格言。\n这一纹章在纹章院有“古老记录”。纹章是银色盾章，上饰有红色十字，第一个四分格中有一把竖立的红色剑。这一纹徽结合英格兰和伦敦市的两位主保圣人的标志：圣佐治十字及象征圣保罗殉教的标志。红剑常被误认为是象征伦敦市长沃尔沃斯杀死农民大起义领袖瓦特·泰勒时用的短刀，但实际上纹章在泰勒被杀前数月就已开始使用，说剑的图案代表沃尔沃斯的短刀的说法则要到17世纪晚期才出现。\n伦敦市的拉丁语格言是“Domine dirige nos”，意思是“主，引领我们”。有迹象显示此格言在17世纪开始使用，最早记录的使用是在1633年。\n伦敦市的市旗是以市法团盾徽上的纹徽为图案的banner of arms。\n== 地理 ==\n伦敦市在英格兰名誉郡中论面积和人口都是最小的郡，论人口密度则排名第四。在英格兰的326个区中，伦敦市的人口是第二少的（最少的是锡利群岛），面积则是最小的。它也是英格兰的各市中人口最少的（在全英国则有两个威尔士的市人口更少）。\n城区的高度从最低的海平面（泰晤士河畔）到最高的海拔ft（在霍本高街（High Holborn）和法院巷转角）不等。历史城区中有两个山丘，规模很小但具历史意义：城西的卢德门丘（Ludgate Hill）和城东的谷丘（Cornhill）。两丘之间流淌著River_Walbrook，现今在地下流淌的伦敦“消失的河流”之一（附近的弗利特河也是一条地下河）。\n==人口==\n据英国国家统计署统计，2011年时伦敦市的人口是7,375人，比2001年上一次人口普查时的人口数略有增加，统计署估计2016年中的人口是9,401人。2001年人口普查时的居民民族组成是：84.6% 白人，6.8%南亚裔，2.6%黑人，2.3%混血人，2.0%华人以及1.7%“其他民族”。右列的是自1801年以来的人口数量变迁（根据10年一度的人口普查数据）。19实际上半叶伦敦市的人口大约维持在120,000至140,000人口，但在1851至1991年之间持续大幅下降，直到1991年至2001之间又有小幅增长。这一时间段中伦敦城衹有1994年有显著的边界改变。\n伦敦市的全职工作人口的每周毛收入比大伦敦及大不列颠岛（英格兰、威尔士、苏格兰）总体要高许多：伦敦市的中位收入是£773.30，大伦敦是£598.60，大不列颠是£491.00。男女两性之间的收入有较大的差别:男性是£1,085.90，女性£653.50。2001年人口普查数据显示伦敦市在英格兰和威尔士各区中有特殊性质：伦敦市的人口增长比例、一人户型、学位或更高级别的学历、以及拥挤程度都是最高的；拥有小汽车或面包车、坐汽车上班、已婚夫妇户型比例、以及每户平均人口（1.58人）都是最低的。此外，它还是大伦敦地区中无宗教信仰人口和就业人口最高的区。\n==特殊地位==\n伦敦市由一个非常特殊的自治团体「伦敦市法团」（City of London Corporation）管理。该市的座右铭「Domine dirige nos」在拉丁文中意指「主，引领我们」。\n虽然伦敦市是大伦敦区的一部分，且参与大伦敦议会和大伦敦市长的选举，但在一些方面仍保持它的特殊独立地位。例如：代表君王象征性监督大伦敦的大伦敦郡尉的辖区包括整个大伦敦但不包括伦敦市；伦敦市的警务由独立的伦敦市警察（City of London Police）负责，而大伦敦其他地区则由伦敦都市警察（Metropolitan Police Service）负责。\n作为仪式上的郡级单位，伦敦市有独立于大伦敦的郡尉设置，但根据传统伦敦市郡尉不是一人专任，而是由委员会代任。伦敦市市长是郡尉代任专员之首。\n管辖整个英格兰和威尔士的中央刑事法院位于伦敦市境内。历史上中央刑事法院最早是伦敦市市长的公堂，后来才由英国政府为了维持司法公正而将辖区扩展至整个英格兰和威尔士。因此至今中央刑事法院驻地老贝利的产权仍为伦敦市法团所有，并且整个法院的运作都由伦敦市法团出资并管理。\n==地标==\n===历史建筑===\n大轰炸和二战后的重建，意味着尽管这座城市有着悠久的历史，但完整的历史建筑却比人们预期的要少。尽管如此，仍有许多（主要是维多利亚时代和爱德华时代）的精美建筑，典型的是历史主义建筑和新古典主义风格。这些建筑包括伦敦大火纪念碑、圣保罗座堂、市政厅、皇家交易所、约翰逊博士之家（Dr. Johnson's House）、市长勋爵官邸和众多教堂，许多都是由克里斯多佛·雷恩爵士设计，他还设计了圣保罗座堂。圣殿区域曾遭受严重轰炸，幸存建筑包括王座步道2号（2 King's Bench Walk）和亨利王子的房间，该地区已基本上重建为其历史形态。另一个被炸弹破坏的地方已修复的例子是霍尔本（Holborn）的斯台普酒店（Staple Inn）。罗马伦敦城墙还存在一小段，例如在伦敦塔附近和巴比肯地区。二十世纪的登录建筑有布拉肯大厦（Bracken House），这是该国二战后第一个受到法定保护的建筑，以及整个巴比肯屋村和金巷屋村（Golden Lane Estate）。\n伦敦塔不在伦敦城内，但却是一个著名的旅游景点，将游客带到伦敦城东南部。其他具有历史意义的地标性建筑包括英格兰银行、老贝利街、海关大楼、史密斯菲尔德市场、利德贺市场和圣巴多罗买医院。值得注意的当代建筑包括劳埃德大厦等许多现代高层建筑。\n英格兰银行（左）和皇家交易所（中）是伦敦金融城众多重要建筑中的两座。\n=== 高层建筑 ===\n2021年伦敦城天际线，包括芬乔奇街20号、利德贺大楼、圣玛莉艾克斯30号大楼和伦敦城最高建筑主教门22号，左下角为伦敦桥\n参见：伦敦最高建筑列表\n伦敦城的高层建筑和摩天大楼越来越多，主要由金融行业使用。几乎所有高层建筑都位于伦敦城的金融中心，主教门、利德贺街和芬丘奇街的东侧。北部有一个较小的建筑群，包括巴比肯屋村的三座高层住宅楼和Citypoint商业楼。2007年，高abbr=on的Drapers'Gardens大楼被拆除，取而代之的是一座较矮的塔楼。\n伦敦城高度超过100米的建筑有：\n时间线\n该市最高建筑的时间线如下：\n==

后,对于重症和危重症患者,建议各地到指定康复医疗机构接受呼吸康复治疗。对于轻症、普遍型的患者,多数患者没有肺功能后遗问题,我们可以各地指定在社区或者在家庭中在医疗观察的同时,循序渐进进行一些增进身心健康的运动锻炼。谢谢。上海文汇报记者:疫情发生以来,有众多护理人员一直奋战在抗击疫情第一线,尤其是重症专业的护士更是备受关注,他们的付出,我们已经从各种媒体上看到了。请问各位嘉宾,应该如何评价重症护理在此次抗击新冠肺炎救治病人当中的作用,我们应该如何认识和评价?郭娜:首先,非常感谢您对重症护理的关注。大家都知道新冠肺炎重症患者病情危重、变化迅速,常常合并多器官功能衰竭和多种并发症的发生,治疗手段非常复杂,护理工作极大,对他们的专业技能要求也是非常高。这个过程中严密观察病情、密切医护配合,做好危重症患者的整体护理对于患者的预后非常重要。考虑到湖北和武汉重症以及危重症患者治疗需要,此次在国家援派的医疗队中共派出5500余名重症专业护士,(且国家队中有1.4万名护士服务于重症护理,他们约占派驻护士总人数的一半),重症专业护士占重症医务人员总数的3/4。所以可以看到他们是一支非常重要的力量。在救治的工作当中,重症护士一方面严密监测患者生命体征,关注他们呼吸循环的情况,同时要严格做好人工气道的管理、肾脏替代治疗、ecmo护理、俯卧位通气护理等等。对于危重症患者同时要积极预防呼吸机相关性肺炎、导管相关性血流感染、深静脉血栓形成,压疮等一系列的并发症。事实证明通过护士们的精心护理,病人的病情得到了缓解,情绪得到了纾解,也确保了救治效果。近日,由国家卫生健康委、国家援鄂抗疫医疗队牵头紧急制定了《新冠肺炎重症、危重症患者的护理规范》,也已经通过文件印发给了地方。其中关于重型、危重型患者病情监测护理规范、机械通气护理规范、俯卧位通气护理规范以及镇静镇痛患者护理规范等等,对于重症患者的临床护理工作都起到了很好的指导作用。谢谢。香港中评社记者:疫情期间很多地区的正常就诊受到了一些影响,请问如何加强和增进互联网诊疗的规范和监管,帮助其他疾病的患者尤其是慢性病的患者及时就诊,进而缓解线下问诊的压力以及避免人群聚集和交叉感染?谢谢。郭燕红:2月初,正当疫情防治任务非常重的背景下,我们委就对疫情期间做好互联网的医疗和咨询服务进行了部署和安排,我们要求各个省卫生健康行政部门要迅速建立和开通省里的互联网平台,同时组织有条件的互联网医疗机构提供相应的线上和线下服务。这些线上和线下服务包括这几个方面,第一,在线上提供咨询服务,对公众的一些疑问,包括一些日常的医疗服务的咨询,发挥线上诊疗的作用。第二个方面,对于一些慢性病患者提供慢病的复诊服务,我们很多慢性病患者的用药、管理各方面也发挥了线上服务和线下相结合的作用。第三,一些发热病人不一定都是新冠患者或疑似患者,这些发热病人也会通过互联网来咨询,到底是什么情况,到底有什么问题,及时的缓解这些发热病人向发热门诊聚集的情况。所以通过互联网医疗的线上线下服务,既能够让公众得到方便、快捷、可及的医疗服务和医疗咨询服务,同时也减少了患者在医院内的聚集,降低了交叉感染的风险。各个省在这方面都有一些很好的做法,比如上海提供了网上咨询平台,特别是对发热病人提供咨询。由医生为患者答疑解惑,来解决他们在发热过程当中一些医疗诉求。浙江在互联网医疗服务当中做的也非常好,他们打通了互联网诊疗的渠道,由各个医疗点、医疗机构对患者提供网上的医疗服务,同时指导患者更精准地进入到线下医疗服务保障当中来。据他们统计,通过开通线上医疗服务,使得发热门诊的医疗量就诊量降低了50%。疫情比较严重的湖北,也指导医疗机构加强了线上医疗服务,对他们正常的特别是慢病患者的医疗服务提供网上医疗、网上会诊,同时利用视频手段进行线上医疗服务。应该说通过一系列的举措,既满足了患者的医疗服务需求,同时也减少了患者的聚集,降低了感染的风险。当然,我们也要求各个省卫生健康行政部门要加强对互联网服务的监管,确保互联网服务能够规范,能够确保患者安全。中央广播电视总台央视中文国际频道记者:日前,上海等城市印发通知,要求各相关医疗机构发挥中医药特色和优势。请问新冠肺炎患者恢复期的康复治疗中,中医药能发挥怎样作用?现在已经采取了哪些措施?这些措施现在取得了哪些成效?谢谢。王融冰:大家知道中医自古以来在治疗方面就讲究未病先防、既病防变、瘥后防复,所谓“防复”就是尽快体能康复、防止复发,体现了中医治未病的思想,千百年来也积累了方便有效的方药和中医技术。目前我们国家最近公布的新冠肺炎患者康复出院的病人已经有三万多例,前一段通过对上万例病人的调查,了解到这些病人虽然出院,但他们还存在一些症状比如乏力、纳差等气虚表现,一些重症病人还表现在肺功能恢复还不够完全,没有完全恢复。有的病人肺炎还没有完全达到吸收,有可能少数重症病人会遗留下肺纤维化,所以目前的康复治疗时期对于这些患者来说至关重要,康复期尽快使病人完全康复、彻底康复,不仅改善现在的生活质量,同时对远期愈后都有很大的影响和好处。国务院联防联控医疗救治组组织了专家制定了《新冠肺炎患者恢复期中医康复指导建议》,中医药专家们提出了方方面面的康复的方法,给患者提供了中医的康复大餐或者说中医的康复套餐,根据自己的需求选择不同的康复方法。具体的包括药物上的帮助、生活上的指导、情志上的调节、体能的恢复、呼吸经络的训练、传统功法的练习,通过对出院患者的康复期帮助,使他尽早达到康复目的,减少他最后出现后遗症的可能性。药物治疗和第六版恢复期药物治疗是衔接配套的,在药物治疗里分两个证型,脾肺气虚型和气阴两虚型,分别用恢复期方案的两个处方,还可以在必要时用一些中成药。对于生活上的指导,日常生活的指导方面也做了很多具体工作。大家可能关心非药物治疗,中医药的适宜技术是指什么?是指非药物治疗,人们耳熟能详的一些方法,比如说艾灸针刺,搞针灸的专家说通过艾灸可以使病人很快吸收。还有经络推拿方法,还有拔罐、刮痧的办法,常用的耳穴压豆这些治疗方法在患者康复期是非常有作用的。这些都和经络、穴位有关系,所以特别建议在中医师的指导下进行,穴位取不准肯定影响疗效。刚才提到上海,据我所知武汉做的更具体,出台了《关于出院后病人的集中隔离中医康复工作的管理的通知》,使得我们在康复期对病人的指导更加有序进行,使我们对病人康复期的工作有序规范化的开展,保证疗效,保证患者的权益。另外我知道北京、广州、沈阳、福州都开始了这些工作,越早开展越好,对病人愈后越有帮助。谢谢。健康报记者:前一阵,有一则新闻备受关注,由于湖北省疫情防治交通管制,一些癫痫患儿,精神病患者面临断药的风险,请问疫情期间如何保证湖北省尤其是武汉市其他重大疾病的救治诊疗工作?谢谢。郭燕红:谢谢记者的提问,正像您所说的那样,在新冠肺炎疫情发生以来,全国医疗卫生系统迅速投入到疫情的防控和患者的救治工作当中。在疫情防控和患者救治当中,我们也抽调了29个省(区、市)和新疆生产建设兵团的4.2万的精锐医务力量投入到对湖北武汉的患者救治工作当中,在新冠肺炎患者救治工作中发挥了非常重要的作用。在对疫情进行研判的基础上,我们提出了要突出重点、统筹兼顾;分类指导、分区施策;在这样的原则下根据省里对区域划分的基础上分出高风险、中风险、低风险地区。针对高风险地区,比如湖北武汉就要以当前新冠肺炎防治和患者救治工作为重点,加强救治力量的统筹。首先要保障肿瘤,尿毒症这些慢病患者,需要长期维持治疗的这些患者的医疗需求,同时还要保障一些重点人群,比如孕产妇、儿童、老年人等,要保障他们的日常医疗服务需求,同时还要保障急诊的医疗服务。现在湖北省已经公开了接诊非新冠肺炎患者的医疗机构名单,同时还指定了非新冠肺炎的产妇就诊的医疗机构名单,就是有序地引导和保障好日常患者的医疗服务需求。对于中风险地区,我们一手要抓好疫情防治和患者救治工作,另外也要逐步恢复日常医疗服务的提供和保障。在疫情研判基础上,逐步把工作重点转到日常医疗服务保障工作上来。低风险地区,要全面迅速恢复日常的医疗服务工作,能够满足人民群众健康的服务需求。总的来讲,现在一手要抓疫情防治和患者救治,另一手是要保障好人民群众日常医疗服务需求,对日常的门诊服务、住院服务绝对不能一停了之、一关了之。每日经济新闻记者:目前新冠肺炎诊疗方案已经更新至试行第六版,疫情爆发初期必须以疾病救治为主,随着疫情的好转、治愈人数的增多,是否考虑在诊疗方案中增加对新冠肺炎患者的功能评估标准和早期康复内容,以便指导临床?谢谢。郭燕红:谢谢这位记者的提问,大家都知道新冠病毒是一个新病毒,新冠病毒肺炎是一个新发传染病,我们对这个新发传染病的认识在不断加深,同时临床实践中也有大量经验积累,同时科研攻关力量也逐步在一些关键问题中有一些攻关的科研成果,现在是第六版诊疗方案,从2月初到现在诊疗方案都在不断地修订和完善当中。其实就是把研究中和临床实践当中行之有效的治疗技术、治疗策略和方法纳入到诊疗方案当中,以指导临床实践,提高医疗救治水平。目前,我们正在着手启动第七版,也就是第六版的修订工作。在修订当中,我们同样要把前期很多的临床实践,包括病理的结果,以及新的确认有效的手段和药物,包括刚才这位记者所说的康复的一些内容纳入到我们诊疗方案当中,以使得我们在患者的医疗救治当中,既要能够去促进康复、促进治愈,同时也要不断提高健康恢复的水平。谢谢。中国教育电视台记者:在新冠肺炎的重症患者治疗中采取积极策略,请问具体有哪些措施?谢谢。王贵强:谢谢这位记者的提问,我们对重症患者的救治是降低病死率的关键,解决了重症患者的问题,也就解决了临床救治的问题,因为重症病人导致危重症,最后病人可能死亡。针对重症患者的救治,有两方面主要保障措施,第一个是从管理方面,就像刚才郭燕红女士提到的,我们制定了一系列的诊疗方案,并及时更新,指导规范临床实践;另一方面组织了不同层次的专家组指导救治,通过远程、现场等多种方式进行指导,保障救治能力和水平。第二个方面就是具体举措,简单来说,我们还是强调早诊早治,这个病是进展性疾病,早期干预、早期治疗可以有效控制疾病进展,不发展为重症。重症的通过早期干预,及时控制危重症发展。前一阶段由于病人比较多,所以很多病人救治时间晚,导致有一部分病人没有及时得到治疗,现在形势完全不一样了,完全做到了应收尽收、应治尽治,并且是分层管理,重症患者及时到有条件的定点医院进行相应救治。我们说早期干预确实很重要,包括早期的抗病毒、氧疗等等,可以有效地阻止病情进展。第二,我们强调综合救治,这是一个新型传染病,缺血缺氧,氧气不能有效供应之后致使多脏器受累,一方面强调积极的氧疗,保证有效的氧供是至关重要的,同时也预防各种并发症,保护重要的脏器。缺血缺氧,尤其是缺氧以后很多重要脏器会出问题,尤其是有基础病的老年人,这些脏器功能本身不是很健全的情况下,在缺氧的影响下会使他的基础病迅速恶化导致病人最终死亡,所以脏器保护和维护是至关重要的一个环节。第三点我们强调早干预,找到一些预测预警指标,通过这么长时间的临床探索发现很多指标可以作为早期的预测预警指标,进行及时干预。包括病情快速变化,比如持续高热、淋巴细胞逐渐减少,乳酸水平或者白细胞介素-6、c反应蛋白这些炎症指标快速增长以及影像学快速进展等等这些都是我们更早干预的早期指标。通过这样的一系列方法可以更及时地处理可能的问题,不至于病情持续恶化。还有一点,有一些新技术、新疗法,通过诊疗方案的更新充实到治疗中,包括恢复期血浆治疗、血液净化治疗、干细胞、抗病毒等等,我们实时在更新。希望通过这些新技术新疗法的应用,进一步降低病死率,在临床中发挥一定的作用。此外,我们根据发病机制的研究,也包括近来的病理解剖的结果,包括对一些死亡病例的研判,发现血栓的形成、突发的心梗以及严重的合并感染等等可能是最终病人进展的非常重要因素,所以也出台了一系列的相应办法,比如低分子酐素,避免或降低血栓的形成,包括抗真菌药物及时的使用,也包括针对痰堵、肺部病变等这些有效的雾化吸入、稀释痰液、进行吸痰等等一系列的办法,通过这些办法我们渴望有效降低病死率,提高治愈率。谢谢。米锋:谢谢,今天发布会现场答问就到这里。接下来有请谢欲晓女士介绍健康知识。谢欲晓:谢谢主持人。下面我来解答几个关于康复锻炼的问题。第一个问题,新冠肺炎轻症、重症患者治愈出院后该如何锻炼身体?对新冠肺炎治愈出院后的患者,在继续做好安全防护和遵守两周医学观察的前提下,针对不同类型的患者,根据患者的心肺功能、心理状态、体能等,可以因人而异、分类指导,可以进行适当可行的康复干预。轻症患者出院后,康复主要以恢复体能和心理调整为主,可以根据患者过去的运动习惯和爱好选择循序渐进的有氧训练,逐步恢复到发病前的活动能力。重症患者符合出院标准以后,可能少数人在一段时间内还会存在全身虚弱、气短、呼吸肌无力和肌肉萎缩以及有一些心理问题。对他们首先进行心肺功能以及全身功能评估,如果合并有高血压、冠心病、糖尿病这些疾病的,还要和相关专科大夫合作设计个性化的康复方案,包括呼吸功能训练和体能训练。重症患者做体能训练,尤其是做有氧训练方案的时候要特别细致的制定运动处方,逐步增强运动强度和时长。一般来说有氧运动每周要求训练3-5次,每次时间是20-30分钟。如果病人特别容易疲劳,就要采取分段间歇性的运动形式,比如说可以从3-5分钟一小节开始,每天分3段进行,争取在第二周能够争取到每段10分钟以上。活动量的掌握,要注意活动中可以简单对话不中断,运动后没有明显的疲劳感,尤其是第二天没有疲劳感,这样的情况是最合适的。第二个问题,在疫情期间有的患者可能不能到医院接受康复治疗,如何在家中进行自我康复治疗?疫情期间不方便到医院的患者,首先最主要的是保证不要完全卧床,在家里有限的空间尽量主动活动,能够站就少坐,能够坐就少躺。如果是躺着,也要争取多翻身。针对高血压、冠心病、糖尿病的病人,首先强调药物治疗和合理饮食,运动锻炼方面注意保持日常常规的活动量,可以采取合适居家的方式变换过去的习惯方式,等量的方式采取,比如换成固定的踏车、室内的慢跑或者快走,练习太极拳和八段锦等等,但是不主张这段时间里突然增加运动量,造成运动过量以及跌倒的危险。针对中风瘫痪的患者主要注意保持坐位,自己训练或者在家人辅助下从卧位到坐起、床边坐稳、从坐到站的练习,只要能站的话,争取每次站30分钟以上,不管是被动的站,别人扶着站还是自己站。在家训练走路的时候如果没有家人在旁边扶持,一定要保证好手的这一边有稳定的扶手或者有牢固的家具扶持,避免跌倒。对于骨折、打石膏固定这样的患者,也要积极早期活动,固定的是骨折部分,活动的是不固定的这部分。比如下肢要在扶稳的状态下进行早期站立活动,手术大夫也许会说不要负重这一侧下肢,不负重也要站,就在好腿负重,总之不能卧床时间长和完全卧床,研究证明完全卧床一天我们的肌力就会下降2%。吞咽障碍的患者往往是家庭护理的难题,也是容易造成反复的吸入性肺炎、肺部感染的危险因素。这样的患者进食的时候,把床头摇高或垫高至少大约30度,稍稍低头,在身体两侧垫枕头,使身体保持稳定,选择不锈钢稍厚一点小一点的勺子,从少量开始慢慢进食。谢谢大家。米锋:谢谢几位嘉宾,今天的发布会给我们传递了有力的信心,截至2月28日已经有接近4万名患者在医护同心的共同努力下治愈出院,他们康复后很多人选择做了共同的一件事,就是捐献了自己的血浆,去帮助挽救更多的生命。我想疫去花开日,便是凯旋时。我们也期待更多正在积极接受治疗的患者早日康复,也期待所有医者平安归来。明天我们发布会将围绕依法有效防控海外疫情输入,继续回答媒体提问,欢迎大家继续关注。今天的发布会到此结束,谢谢大家!\n\n[要求]

,对于重症和危重症患者,建议各地到指定康复医疗机构接受呼吸康复治疗。对于轻症、普遍型的患者,多数患者没有肺功能后遗问题,我们可以各地指定在社区或者在家庭中在医疗观察的同时,循序渐进进行一些增进身心健康的运动锻炼。谢谢。上海文汇报记者:疫情发生以来,有众多护理人员一直奋战在抗击疫情第一线,尤其是重症专业的护士更是备受关注,他们的付出,我们已经从各种媒体上看到了。请问各位嘉宾,应该如何评价重症护理在此次抗击新冠肺炎救治病人当中的作用,我们应该如何认识和评价?郭娜:首先,非常感谢您对重症护理的关注。大家都知道新冠肺炎重症患者病情危重、变化迅速,常常合并多器官功能衰竭和多种并发症的发生,治疗手段非常复杂,护理工作极大,对他们的专业技能要求也是非常高。这个过程中严密观察病情、密切医护配合,做好危重症患者的整体护理对于患者的预后非常重要。考虑到湖北和武汉重症以及危重症患者治疗需要,此次在国家援派的医疗队中共派出5500余名重症专业护士,(且国家队中有1.4万名护士服务于重症护理,他们约占派驻护士总人数的一半),重症专业护士占重症医务人员总数的3/4。所以可以看到他们是一支非常重要的力量。在救治的工作当中,重症护士一方面严密监测患者生命体征,关注他们呼吸循环的情况,同时要严格做好人工气道的管理、肾脏替代治疗、ecmo护理、俯卧位通气护理等等。对于危重症患者同时要积极预防呼吸机相关性肺炎、导管相关性血流感染、深静脉血栓形成,压疮等一系列的并发症。事实证明通过护士们的精心护理,病人的病情得到了缓解,情绪得到了纾解,也确保了救治效果。近日,由国家卫生健康委、国家援鄂抗疫医疗队牵头紧急制定了《新冠肺炎重症、危重症患者的护理规范》,也已经通过文件印发给了地方。其中关于重型、危重型患者病情监测护理规范、机械通气护理规范、俯卧位通气护理规范以及镇静镇痛患者护理规范等等,对于重症患者的临床护理工作都起到了很好的指导作用。谢谢。香港中评社记者:疫情期间很多地区的正常就诊受到了一些影响,请问如何加强和增进互联网诊疗的规范和监管,帮助其他疾病的患者尤其是慢性病的患者及时就诊,进而缓解线下问诊的压力以及避免人群聚集和交叉感染?谢谢。郭燕红:2月初,正当疫情防治任务非常重的背景下,我们委就对疫情期间做好互联网的医疗和咨询服务进行了部署和安排,我们要求各个省卫生健康行政部门要迅速建立和开通省里的互联网平台,同时组织有条件的互联网医疗机构提供相应的线上和线下服务。这些线上和线下服务包括这几个方面,第一,在线上提供咨询服务,对公众的一些疑问,包括一些日常的医疗服务的咨询,发挥线上诊疗的作用。第二个方面,对于一些慢性病患者提供慢病的复诊服务,我们很多慢性病患者的用药、管理各方面也发挥了线上服务和线下相结合的作用。第三,一些发热病人不一定都是新冠患者或疑似患者,这些发热病人也会通过互联网来咨询,到底是什么情况,到底有什么问题,及时的缓解这些发热病人向发热门诊聚集的情况。所以通过互联网医疗的线上线下服务,既能够让公众得到方便、快捷、可及的医疗服务和医疗咨询服务,同时也减少了患者在医院内的聚集,降低了交叉感染的风险。各个省在这方面都有一些很好的做法,比如上海提供了网上咨询平台,特别是对发热病人提供咨询。由医生为患者答疑解惑,来解决他们在发热过程当中一些医疗诉求。浙江在互联网医疗服务当中做的也非常好,他们打通了互联网诊疗的渠道,由各个医疗点、医疗机构对患者提供网上的医疗服务,同时指导患者更精准地进入到线下医疗服务保障当中来。据他们统计,通过开通线上医疗服务,使得发热门诊的医疗量就诊量降低了50%。疫情比较严重的湖北,也指导医疗机构加强了线上医疗服务,对他们正常的特别是慢病患者的医疗服务提供网上医疗、网上会诊,同时利用视频手段进行线上医疗服务。应该说通过一系列的举措,既满足了患者的医疗服务需求,同时也减少了患者的聚集,降低了感染的风险。当然,我们也要求各个省卫生健康行政部门要加强对互联网服务的监管,确保互联网服务能够规范,能够确保患者安全。中央广播电视总台央视中文国际频道记者:日前,上海等城市印发通知,要求各相关医疗机构发挥中医药特色和优势。请问新冠肺炎患者恢复期的康复治疗中,中医药能发挥怎样作用?现在已经采取了哪些措施?这些措施现在取得了哪些成效?谢谢。王融冰:大家知道中医自古以来在治疗方面就讲究未病先防、既病防变、瘥后防复,所谓“防复”就是尽快体能康复、防止复发,体现了中医治未病的思想,千百年来也积累了方便有效的方药和中医技术。目前我们国家最近公布的新冠肺炎患者康复出院的病人已经有三万多例,前一段通过对上万例病人的调查,了解到这些病人虽然出院,但他们还存在一些症状比如乏力、纳差等气虚表现,一些重症病人还表现在肺功能恢复还不够完全,没有完全恢复。有的病人肺炎还没有完全达到吸收,有可能少数重症病人会遗留下肺纤维化,所以目前的康复治疗时期对于这些患者来说至关重要,康复期尽快使病人完全康复、彻底康复,不仅改善现在的生活质量,同时对远期愈后都有很大的影响和好处。国务院联防联控医疗救治组组织了专家制定了《新冠肺炎患者恢复期中医康复指导建议》,中医药专家们提出了方方面面的康复的方法,给患者提供了中医的康复大餐或者说中医的康复套餐,根据自己的需求选择不同的康复方法。具体的包括药物上的帮助、生活上的指导、情志上的调节、体能的恢复、呼吸经络的训练、传统功法的练习,通过对出院患者的康复期帮助,使他尽早达到康复目的,减少他最后出现后遗症的可能性。药物治疗和第六版恢复期药物治疗是衔接配套的,在药物治疗里分两个证型,脾肺气虚型和气阴两虚型,分别用恢复期方案的两个处方,还可以在必要时用一些中成药。对于生活上的指导,日常生活的指导方面也做了很多具体工作。大家可能关心非药物治疗,中医药的适宜技术是指什么?是指非药物治疗,人们耳熟能详的一些方法,比如说艾灸针刺,搞针灸的专家说通过艾灸可以使病人很快吸收。还有经络推拿方法,还有拔罐、刮痧的办法,常用的耳穴压豆这些治疗方法在患者康复期是非常有作用的。这些都和经络、穴位有关系,所以特别建议在中医师的指导下进行,穴位取不准肯定影响疗效。刚才提到上海,据我所知武汉做的更具体,出台了《关于出院后病人的集中隔离中医康复工作的管理的通知》,使得我们在康复期对病人的指导更加有序进行,使我们对病人康复期的工作有序规范化的开展,保证疗效,保证患者的权益。另外我知道北京、广州、沈阳、福州都开始了这些工作,越早开展越好,对病人愈后越有帮助。谢谢。健康报记者:前一阵,有一则新闻备受关注,由于湖北省疫情防治交通管制,一些癫痫患儿,精神病患者面临断药的风险,请问疫情期间如何保证湖北省尤其是武汉市其他重大疾病的救治诊疗工作?谢谢。郭燕红:谢谢记者的提问,正像您所说的那样,在新冠肺炎疫情发生以来,全国医疗卫生系统迅速投入到疫情的防控和患者的救治工作当中。在疫情防控和患者救治当中,我们也抽调了29个省(区、市)和新疆生产建设兵团的4.2万的精锐医务力量投入到对湖北武汉的患者救治工作当中,在新冠肺炎患者救治工作中发挥了非常重要的作用。在对疫情进行研判的基础上,我们提出了要突出重点、统筹兼顾;分类指导、分区施策;在这样的原则下根据省里对区域划分的基础上分出高风险、中风险、低风险地区。针对高风险地区,比如湖北武汉就要以当前新冠肺炎防治和患者救治工作为重点,加强救治力量的统筹。首先要保障肿瘤,尿毒症这些慢病患者,需要长期维持治疗的这些患者的医疗需求,同时还要保障一些重点人群,比如孕产妇、儿童、老年人等,要保障他们的日常医疗服务需求,同时还要保障急诊的医疗服务。现在湖北省已经公开了接诊非新冠肺炎患者的医疗机构名单,同时还指定了非新冠肺炎的产妇就诊的医疗机构名单,就是有序地引导和保障好日常患者的医疗服务需求。对于中风险地区,我们一手要抓好疫情防治和患者救治工作,另外也要逐步恢复日常医疗服务的提供和保障。在疫情研判基础上,逐步把工作重点转到日常医疗服务保障工作上来。低风险地区,要全面迅速恢复日常的医疗服务工作,能够满足人民群众健康的服务需求。总的来讲,现在一手要抓疫情防治和患者救治,另一手是要保障好人民群众日常医疗服务需求,对日常的门诊服务、住院服务绝对不能一停了之、一关了之。每日经济新闻记者:目前新冠肺炎诊疗方案已经更新至试行第六版,疫情爆发初期必须以疾病救治为主,随着疫情的好转、治愈人数的增多,是否考虑在诊疗方案中增加对新冠肺炎患者的功能评估标准和早期康复内容,以便指导临床?谢谢。郭燕红:谢谢这位记者的提问,大家都知道新冠病毒是一个新病毒,新冠病毒肺炎是一个新发传染病,我们对这个新发传染病的认识在不断加深,同时临床实践中也有大量经验积累,同时科研攻关力量也逐步在一些关键问题中有一些攻关的科研成果,现在是第六版诊疗方案,从2月初到现在诊疗方案都在不断地修订和完善当中。其实就是把研究中和临床实践当中行之有效的治疗技术、治疗策略和方法纳入到诊疗方案当中,以指导临床实践,提高医疗救治水平。目前,我们正在着手启动第七版,也就是第六版的修订工作。在修订当中,我们同样要把前期很多的临床实践,包括病理的结果,以及新的确认有效的手段和药物,包括刚才这位记者所说的康复的一些内容纳入到我们诊疗方案当中,以使得我们在患者的医疗救治当中,既要能够去促进康复、促进治愈,同时也要不断提高健康恢复的水平。谢谢。中国教育电视台记者:在新冠肺炎的重症患者治疗中采取积极策略,请问具体有哪些措施?谢谢。王贵强:谢谢这位记者的提问,我们对重症患者的救治是降低病死率的关键,解决了重症患者的问题,也就解决了临床救治的问题,因为重症病人导致危重症,最后病人可能死亡。针对重症患者的救治,有两方面主要保障措施,第一个是从管理方面,就像刚才郭燕红女士提到的,我们制定了一系列的诊疗方案,并及时更新,指导规范临床实践;另一方面组织了不同层次的专家组指导救治,通过远程、现场等多种方式进行指导,保障救治能力和水平。第二个方面就是具体举措,简单来说,我们还是强调早诊早治,这个病是进展性疾病,早期干预、早期治疗可以有效控制疾病进展,不发展为重症。重症的通过早期干预,及时控制危重症发展。前一阶段由于病人比较多,所以很多病人救治时间晚,导致有一部分病人没有及时得到治疗,现在形势完全不一样了,完全做到了应收尽收、应治尽治,并且是分层管理,重症患者及时到有条件的定点医院进行相应救治。我们说早期干预确实很重要,包括早期的抗病毒、氧疗等等,可以有效地阻止病情进展。第二,我们强调综合救治,这是一个新型传染病,缺血缺氧,氧气不能有效供应之后致使多脏器受累,一方面强调积极的氧疗,保证有效的氧供是至关重要的,同时也预防各种并发症,保护重要的脏器。缺血缺氧,尤其是缺氧以后很多重要脏器会出问题,尤其是有基础病的老年人,这些脏器功能本身不是很健全的情况下,在缺氧的影响下会使他的基础病迅速恶化导致病人最终死亡,所以脏器保护和维护是至关重要的一个环节。第三点我们强调早干预,找到一些预测预警指标,通过这么长时间的临床探索发现很多指标可以作为早期的预测预警指标,进行及时干预。包括病情快速变化,比如持续高热、淋巴细胞逐渐减少,乳酸水平或者白细胞介素-6、c反应蛋白这些炎症指标快速增长以及影像学快速进展等等这些都是我们更早干预的早期指标。通过这样的一系列方法可以更及时地处理可能的问题,不至于病情持续恶化。还有一点,有一些新技术、新疗法,通过诊疗方案的更新充实到治疗中,包括恢复期血浆治疗、血液净化治疗、干细胞、抗病毒等等,我们实时在更新。希望通过这些新技术新疗法的应用,进一步降低病死率,在临床中发挥一定的作用。此外,我们根据发病机制的研究,也包括近来的病理解剖的结果,包括对一些死亡病例的研判,发现血栓的形成、突发的心梗以及严重的合并感染等等可能是最终病人进展的非常重要因素,所以也出台了一系列的相应办法,比如低分子酐素,避免或降低血栓的形成,包括抗真菌药物及时的使用,也包括针对痰堵、肺部病变等这些有效的雾化吸入、稀释痰液、进行吸痰等等一系列的办法,通过这些办法我们渴望有效降低病死率,提高治愈率。谢谢。米锋:谢谢,今天发布会现场答问就到这里。接下来有请谢欲晓女士介绍健康知识。谢欲晓:谢谢主持人。下面我来解答几个关于康复锻炼的问题。第一个问题,新冠肺炎轻症、重症患者治愈出院后该如何锻炼身体?对新冠肺炎治愈出院后的患者,在继续做好安全防护和遵守两周医学观察的前提下,针对不同类型的患者,根据患者的心肺功能、心理状态、体能等,可以因人而异、分类指导,可以进行适当可行的康复干预。轻症患者出院后,康复主要以恢复体能和心理调整为主,可以根据患者过去的运动习惯和爱好选择循序渐进的有氧训练,逐步恢复到发病前的活动能力。重症患者符合出院标准以后,可能少数人在一段时间内还会存在全身虚弱、气短、呼吸肌无力和肌肉萎缩以及有一些心理问题。对他们首先进行心肺功能以及全身功能评估,如果合并有高血压、冠心病、糖尿病这些疾病的,还要和相关专科大夫合作设计个性化的康复方案,包括呼吸功能训练和体能训练。重症患者做体能训练,尤其是做有氧训练方案的时候要特别细致的制定运动处方,逐步增强运动强度和时长。一般来说有氧运动每周要求训练3-5次,每次时间是20-30分钟。如果病人特别容易疲劳,就要采取分段间歇性的运动形式,比如说可以从3-5分钟一小节开始,每天分3段进行,争取在第二周能够争取到每段10分钟以上。活动量的掌握,要注意活动中可以简单对话不中断,运动后没有明显的疲劳感,尤其是第二天没有疲劳感,这样的情况是最合适的。第二个问题,在疫情期间有的患者可能不能到医院接受康复治疗,如何在家中进行自我康复治疗?疫情期间不方便到医院的患者,首先最主要的是保证不要完全卧床,在家里有限的空间尽量主动活动,能够站就少坐,能够坐就少躺。如果是躺着,也要争取多翻身。针对高血压、冠心病、糖尿病的病人,首先强调药物治疗和合理饮食,运动锻炼方面注意保持日常常规的活动量,可以采取合适居家的方式变换过去的习惯方式,等量的方式采取,比如换成固定的踏车、室内的慢跑或者快走,练习太极拳和八段锦等等,但是不主张这段时间里突然增加运动量,造成运动过量以及跌倒的危险。针对中风瘫痪的患者主要注意保持坐位,自己训练或者在家人辅助下从卧位到坐起、床边坐稳、从坐到站的练习,只要能站的话,争取每次站30分钟以上,不管是被动的站,别人扶着站还是自己站。在家训练走路的时候如果没有家人在旁边扶持,一定要保证好手的这一边有稳定的扶手或者有牢固的家具扶持,避免跌倒。对于骨折、打石膏固定这样的患者,也要积极早期活动,固定的是骨折部分,活动的是不固定的这部分。比如下肢要在扶稳的状态下进行早期站立活动,手术大夫也许会说不要负重这一侧下肢,不负重也要站,就在好腿负重,总之不能卧床时间长和完全卧床,研究证明完全卧床一天我们的肌力就会下降2%。吞咽障碍的患者往往是家庭护理的难题,也是容易造成反复的吸入性肺炎、肺部感染的危险因素。这样的患者进食的时候,把床头摇高或垫高至少大约30度,稍稍低头,在身体两侧垫枕头,使身体保持稳定,选择不锈钢稍厚一点小一点的勺子,从少量开始慢慢进食。谢谢大家。米锋:谢谢几位嘉宾,今天的发布会给我们传递了有力的信心,截至2月28日已经有接近4万名患者在医护同心的共同努力下治愈出院,他们康复后很多人选择做了共同的一件事,就是捐献了自己的血浆,去帮助挽救更多的生命。我想疫去花开日,便是凯旋时。我们也期待更多正在积极接受治疗的患者早日康复,也期待所有医者平安归来。明天我们发布会将围绕依法有效防控海外疫情输入,继续回答媒体提问,欢迎大家继续关注。今天的发布会到此结束,谢谢大家!"}

\n什么是战略决战?就是指对战争全局有决定意义的战役,通常表现为交战双方的主力会战,因为只有在会战中歼灭对方的主力,才能最终决定战争的胜负。在全国解放战争中,战略决战就是辽沈、淮海、平津三大战役。正因为战略决战对战争全局起着决定性作用,是战争的真正重心所在,双方的军事统帅不能不全力以赴地为争取真正的胜利而投入这场斗争。又因为它是双方主力的会战,在整个战争过程中是最激烈、最复杂、最变化多端的阶段,在指挥上也是最不容易驾驭的时刻。对军事统帅来说,战略决战是检验他的战略眼光、驾驭复杂局势的能力以及决心和意志力的最好试金石。这里包括:他能不能总揽全局地正确判断客观战争局势的发展;能不能敢于在适当时机下常人难以决断的最大决心,排除种种困难,坚决贯彻实行;能不能灵活地应对战场上出现的可以预见或难以预见的重要变化,随机应变,及时调整部署;能不能巧妙地从战役的这一阶段向下一阶段发展,如此等等。可以说,战略决战在相当程度上也是双方军事统帅指挥作战能力的较量。较量中孰优孰劣,空言争辩是没有用的,一切只能靠战争实践的事实来检验。当然,战略决战的胜败不能单纯从军事这一个角度来考察,它通常有深刻的社会原因,同政治、经济、思想、文化等诸多因素交织在一起,特别是由人心向背这一根本因素所支配,但军事统帅的主观指挥是否正确无疑也起着极为重要的作用。毛泽东曾着重指出这一点:“我要优势和主动,敌人也要这个,从这点上看,战争就是两军指挥员以军力财力等项物质基础作地盘,互争优势和主动的主观能力的竞赛。竞赛结果,有胜有败,除了客观物质条件的比较外,胜者必由于主观指挥的正确,败者必由于主观指挥的错误。”他还指出:“战争是力量的竞赛,但力量在战争过程中变化其原来的形态。在这里,主观的努力,多打胜仗,少犯错误,是决定的因素。客观因素具备着这种变化的可能性,但实现这种可能性,就需要正确的方针和主观的努力。这时候,主观作用是决定的了。”他在这短短的一段话里连用了两次“决定”这个词,来加强语气。战争的胜败,从根本上说,自然取决于客观因素是否具备,取决于人心的向背,取决于胜利一方各级将领、战士以及民众的共同努力,而有了这些条件以后,军事统帅的作战指导是否正确,无疑可以起“决定”作用。对抗双方的统帅,在战略决战中总是竭尽自己的全力进行较量。双方又各拥有一定的实力,力图取胜,否则也没有什么“决战”可言。这就使历史的发展显得波澜起伏,险象环生。最后,一方胜利了,一方失败了。双方统帅的高下和优劣,在这种较量的检验中,表现得远比其他时候更为明显。从而,能激起人们对研究它的浓厚兴趣。笔者常感觉:研究中国共产党在革命时期的历史,必须同时研究国民党,而研究这个时期国民党的历史,也必须研究共产党,注意它们之间的互动关系。如果只把眼光始终对着其中的一个方面,就难以对那段历史有全面的了解。记得在高中读书时,课外看过梁启超的《中国历史研究法》和它的《续编》。有一段话给笔者留下很深的印象。他说:“我们看李瀚章做的《曾文正公年谱》,实在不能满足我们这种欲望。因为他只叙谱主本身的命令举动,只叙清廷指挥擢黜谕旨,其余一切只有带叙,从不专提,使得我们看了,好像从墙隙中观墙外的争斗,不知他们为什么有胜有负!虽然篇幅有十二卷之多,实际上还不够用。倘然有人高兴改做,倒是很好的事情;但千万别忘记旧谱的短处,最要详尽的了解太平天国的一切大事,同时要把人的相互关系,把当时的背景写个明白,才了解曾国藩的全体如何。”这段话是60多年前读的,但梁启超所说的“从墙隙中观墙外的争斗,不知他们为什么有胜有负”那几句话,至今不忘。还可以打个比喻:看人下棋,一定要同时看双方分别如何布局,如何下子。棋局中变化多端,充满着未知数和变数,还要看一方走出什么别人原来没有料到的一着棋时,另一方又是如何应对的,应对的是对还是错。这样才能看懂这局棋。如果眼睛只盯着一方的布局和下子而不看对方,那就根本无法看懂这局棋,甚至也无法真正看懂你所关注的那一方为什么胜利或失败。在战争史中,双方统帅如何统筹全局、作出判断、布局下子,如何处理战争进程中那些异常复杂而有关键意义的问题,他们的领导能力究竟怎样,后果又是如何,常常引起人们的特别兴趣。下面,就毛泽东和蒋介石在三大战略决战中的作战指导,分别作一点综合的考察。关于毛泽东毛泽东本来不是军人。他自己说过:“我是一个知识分子,当一个小学教员,也没学过军事,怎么知道打仗呢?就是由于国民党搞白色恐怖,把工会、农会都打掉了,把五万共产党员杀了一大批,抓了一大批,我们才拿起枪来,上山打游击。”既然如此,为什么毛泽东会成长为一位出色的军事统帅?他的办法是“从战争中学习战争”。这有两层意思:一是要投身到战争实践中去,否则就谈不上从战争中学习战争;二是要在战争实践中用心去想,不断总结实践中成功的经验和失败的教训,用来校正自己的认识和行动,并且把战争中遇到的重要问题提到较高的原则性上去思考和解决,这就是研究战略问题。陈毅曾对毛泽东的军事思想作过这样的概括:“其特点是以实事求是的方法去研究中国战争的实际,去发现和掌握中国革命军事的总规律。”陈毅说得很对。实事求是,确实是毛泽东军事思想的精髓。在战争中,他总是力求熟识敌我双方各方面的情况,使作战的部署和指挥尽量适合当时当地的情况,使主观的指导和客观的实际情况相符合,做那些实际上可能做到的事情,而不是只凭主观愿望去瞎指挥,更不是只说一大堆空话。这是他在战争中所以能克敌制胜的关键所在。当然,对客观事物的认识不可能一次完成,在战争中尤其如此。他清醒地看到:“统统相符合的事,在战争或战斗中是极其少有的,这是因为战争或战斗的双方是成群的武装着的活人,而又互相保持秘密的缘故,这和处置日常事件是大不相同的。然而只要做到指挥大体上适合情况,即在有决定意义的部分适合情况,那就是胜利的基础了。”他对军事统帅如何才能正确地指挥作战的思考和实行过程作了具体而清晰的叙述:“指挥员的正确的部署来源于正确的决心,正确的决心来源于正确的判断,正确的判断来源于周到的和必要的侦察,和对于各种侦察材料的联贯起来的思索。指挥员使用一切可能的和必要的侦察手段,将侦察得来的敌方情况的各种材料加以去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里的思索,然后将自己方面的情况加上去,研究双方的对比和相互的关系,因而构成判断,定下决心,作出计划,——这是军事家在作出每一个战略、战役或战斗的计划之前的一个整个的认识情况的过程。粗心大意的军事家,不去这样做,把军事计划建立在一相情愿的基础之上,这种计划是空想的,不符合于实际的。”“认识情况的过程,不但存在于军事计划建立之前,而且存在于军事计划建立之后。当执行某一计划时,从开始执行起,到战局终结止,这是又一个认识情况的过程,即实行的过程。此时,第一个过程中的东西是否符合于实况,需要重新加以检查。如果计划和情况不符合,或者不完全符合,就必须依照新的认识,构成新的判断,定下新的决心,把已定计划加以改变,使之适合于新的情况。部分地改变的事差不多每一作战都是有的,全部地改变的事也是间或有的。鲁莽家不知改变,或不愿改变,只是一味盲干,结果又非碰壁不可。”这两段话是毛泽东在1936年12月写的,而他在12年后的三大战略决战时作为中国人民解放军最高统帅时也是这样思考和践行的。正确判断战争全局的客观形势,是中国人民解放军决定发动三大战略决战的出发点和基本依据。到1948年8月,正确选择决战时机已成为刻不容缓的问题。解放战争两年来国民党军有生力量被大量消灭,双方力量对比已发生巨大变化。国民党当局正在考虑撤退东北、确保华中的问题,但仍举棋不定。叶剑英写道:“在这种情况下,究竟是让敌人实现他们把现有兵力撤至关内或江南的计划,使我们失去时机,从而增加我军尔后作战的麻烦呢?还是在敌人还没有来得及决策逃跑之前,我们就当机立断,抓住大好时机,组织战略决战,各个消灭敌人的强大战略集团呢?机不可失,时不再来。毛泽东同志根据对战争形势的科学分析,毅然决然地抓住了这个战略决战时机,先后组织了辽沈、淮海、平津三大战役。”在兵力还没有超过对方的条件下,综合各方面因素的考虑,下决心发动战略决战,需要有大智大勇。这也是蒋介石没有料到、因而在事先也没有作出应对准备、结果处处陷于被动挨打的重要原因。抓住决战时机后,确定决战方向十分重要。既要全局在胸,又要正确地选择从何着手,接着如何一步一步发展,直至达到预期的目标。这对军事统帅的指挥能力是一个重要考验。毛泽东历来强调:“一战而胜,再及其余,各个击破,全局因而转成了优势,转成了主动。”他写道:“第一个战斗,关系非常之大。第一个战斗的胜败给予极大的影响于全局,乃至一直影响到最后的一个战斗。”怎样打好“第一个战斗”?毛泽东归纳了三条原则:“第一,必须打胜。必须敌情、地形、人民等条件,都利于我,不利于敌,确有把握而后动手。否则宁可退让,持重待机。机会总是有的,不可率尔应战”;“第二,初战的计划必须是全战役计划的有机的序幕。没有好的全战役计划,绝不能有真正好的第一仗”;“第三,还要想到下一战略阶段的文章。”“战略指导者当其处在一个战略阶段时,应该计算到往后多数阶段,至少也应计算到下一个阶段。尽管往后变化难测,愈远看愈渺茫,然而大体的计算是可能的,估计前途的远景是必要的。”“走一步应该看那一步的具体变化,据此以修改或发展自己战略战役计划,不这样做,就会弄出冒险直冲的错误。然而贯通全战略阶段乃至几个战略阶段的、大体上想通了的、一个长时期的方针,是决不可少的。”三大战略决战是从东北战场开始的。叶剑英描述了毛泽东的决策过程:“当时全国各战场的形势虽然在不同程度上都有利于人民解放军的作战,但敌人在战略上却企图尽量延长坚守东北几个孤立要点的时间,牵制我东北人民解放军,使我军不能入关作战;同时,敌人又准备把东北敌军撤至华中地区,加强华中防御。在这种情况下,如果我们把战略决战的方向,指向华北战场,则会使我军受到傅作义、卫立煌两大战略集团的夹击而陷于被动;如果我们把战略决战的方向首先指向华东战场,则会使东北敌人迅速撤退,而实现他们的战略收缩企图。因此,东北战场就成为全国战局发展的关键。”“决战首先从局部的形势开始,进而争取全局上的更大优势。由于迅速而顺利地取得了辽沈战役的胜利,就使全国战局急转直下,使原来预计的战争进程大为缩短。”作战方向确定后,为了取得理想的作战效果,毛泽东和中央军委在三大战略决战中几乎都采取了奇袭的作战方法。正如《孙子兵法·九地篇第十一》所说:“兵之情主速,由不虞之道,攻其所不戒也。”又如《孙子兵法·计篇第一》所说:“兵者,诡道也。”“攻其无备,出其不意。此兵家之胜,不可先传之。”英国军事学家李德·哈特也写道:“军事计划不用‘奇袭’这把永远管用的钥匙,失败就可能接踵而至,不现实的想法是替代不了这把钥匙的。”这句话大体上也是这个意思。要做到奇袭,并不容易。怎样才能使对方“无备”和“不意”呢?有两个重要条件:一是迅速,二是保密。有时还需要以佯动来造成对方的错觉。在三大战略决战中,初战几乎都采取奇袭的做法,先从对方“不意”的要地突然发动强有力的攻击,在它的防御链上打开一个大的缺口,使对方在部署和心理上都陷于异常慌乱的地步,再一步一步扩大战果,直到取得全局的胜利。拿辽沈战役来说,锦州的重要战略地位是谁都知道的。但当时东北野战军的主力和后方根据地都在北满,又采取了一些佯动,使国民党军误以为解放军会将进攻重点指向长春,而解放军主力却隐蔽地远途奔袭锦州地区,直到以突然行动包围义县并切断锦州同关内的陆路交通,才使蒋介石如梦初醒,慌忙地调整部署,陷入一片混乱。这可以称为奇袭。再看淮海战役,国民党军原来判断解放军会从西侧奔袭徐州,解放军又以多路佯动,增强对方这种错觉,从而将李弥兵团西调,孙元良兵团北调,集中在徐州周围。华东野战军主力立刻乘虚而入,隔断孤悬东侧的黄百韬兵团同徐州之联系,开始了淮海战役的“第一个战斗”。这就打乱了国民党军队在徐州地区的整个部署,随后,中原野战军同样乘虚而入,突袭宿县,切断徐州同蚌埠之间的联系,奠定淮海战役全胜的基础。这也是“攻其不备,出其不意”的奇袭。在平津战役中,国民党军的注意力最初集中在东面,提防东北野战军主力大举入关,蒋介石还要求把部队东移津沽,以备必要时从海路南撤。解放军却出其不意地从西线打起,让原在归绥的杨成武兵团和原在石家庄北面的杨得志兵团分别迅速包围张家口和新保安,将傅作义的注意力吸引到西边,顾不上东线。而东北野战军主力又提前行动,悄悄地越过长城南下,分割东面的北平、天津、塘沽之间的联系。尽管东北解放军不进行休整就开始秘密入关,但有如时任东北野战军第一兵团副司令员的陈伯钧所说:“这时我们对整个华北敌人的战略包围还未形成,我们在津塘方面的兵力还很不够,倘若过早对平津等地实行战役包围,对张家口、新保安、南口等地实行战役进攻,势必吓跑敌人,不利今后作战。除此而外,在辽沈战役结束之后,部队由于连续作战未及休整,又经过长途跋涉,来到关内,十分疲劳。”这些都需要有一定时间。因此,又采取“围而不打”和“隔而不围”这种战史上十分罕见的打法。在这过程中,也有许多奇袭的因素。像下棋一样,下好每一步重要的棋,都必须具有战略眼光,充分考虑这步棋会引起全局发生怎样的变化,乘势扩大战果,夺取全局的胜利。而在关键的地方,必须十分用心,考虑到多种可能性和切实的应对办法。毛泽东指出:“学习战争全局的指导规律,是要用心去想一想才行的。”“指挥全局的人,最要紧的,是把自己的注意力摆在照顾战争的全局上面。主要地是依据情况,照顾部队和兵团的组成问题,照顾两个战役之间的关系问题,照顾各个作战阶段之间的关系问题,照顾我方全部活动和敌方全部活动之间的关系问题,这些都是最吃力的地方,如果丢了这个去忙一些次要的问题,那就难免要吃亏了。”在毛泽东和中央军委指挥下,三大战略决战不是分散的、孤立的、各自进行的三个战役,而是有着通盘筹划,一环紧扣一环,相互照应,一气贯注的完整部署。对具体的作战方法,毛泽东在1947年12月会议上提出了著名的十项军事原则。其中,“集中优势兵力,各个歼灭敌人”是根本的方法。毛泽东很早就说过:“集中兵力看来容易,实行颇难。人人皆知以多胜少是最好的办法,然而很多人不能做,相反地每每分散兵力,原因就在于指导者缺乏战略头脑,为复杂的环境所迷惑,因而被环境所支配,失掉自主能力,采取了应付主义。”这种根本的作战方法,在毛泽东指导三大战略决战时得到了充分的运用。军事胜利从来不是单靠军队来实现的。人民战争更是如此。毛泽东一向强调“兵民是胜利之本”。三大战略决战能获得胜利,一个基本原因是民众的支持,不断以人力物力支援前线。拿淮海战役来说,中央军委决定“举行淮海战役,甚为必要”后三天,毛泽东就为中央军委起草电报指出:“这一战役必比济南战役规模要大,比睢杞战役的规模也可能要大。因此,你们必须有相当时间使攻济兵团获得休整补充,并对全军作战所需包括全部后勤工作在内有充分之准备方能开始行动。”战役开始后不久,周恩来又为中央军委起草致中原局、华北局、华东局电报,说明前线参战部队和民工近百万人,每月需粮约一亿斤,要求各地立即动手筹集并速调粮食供应前线。那时供应解放军前线的物资运送,几乎全靠肩挑背负、小车推送。粟裕回忆道:“参战部队加支前民工每日需粮数百万斤。加上天气寒冷,供应线长,运输不便。因此,粮食的供应,就成为淮海战役能否取胜的一个重要关键。为此,毛泽东同志一再指示我们,必须统筹解决全军连同民工一百三十万人三至五个月的口粮,以及弹药、草料和伤员的治疗等问题。华东局发出了‘全力以赴,支援前线’的指示,提出了‘解放军打到哪里,就支援到哪里’的口号,组成了华东支前委员会,进一步加强了对支前工作的统一领导。山东人民积极响应党的号召,省吃俭用,保证了部队用粮。”淮海战役后期的解放军阵地上,“粮足饭香,兵强马壮。待战役结束时,前方尚存余粮四千多万斤”。整个淮海战役中,共动员民工543万人次,运送弹药1460多万斤,粮食9亿6千万斤。陈毅深情地说:淮海战役的胜利是人民群众用小车推出来的。这同国民党军队屡屡弹尽粮绝,陷入绝境,成为他们多次覆没的重要原因,恰成鲜明的对照。能不能得到民众的全力支持,确实是战争能不能取得胜利的根本问题。毛泽东思想是集体智慧的结晶。在军事领域内,他十分重视处在第一线的将领们的意见,常同他们反复商议,认真听取并考虑他们的判断和建议。以淮海战役为例:它的发动,起于华东野战军代司令兼代政委粟裕在济南战役快结束时向中央军委“建议即进行淮海战役”第二天,毛泽东立即为中央军委起草复电:“我们认为举行淮海战役,甚为必要。”当华东野战军正准备分割包围黄百韬兵团时,留在大别山地区的中原野战军司令员刘伯承在1948年11月3日致电中央军委提出:“蒋军重兵守徐州,其补给线只一津浦路,怕我截断,……只要不是重大不利之变化,陈、邓(指陈毅、邓小平——引者注)主力似应力求截断徐、蚌间铁路,造成隔断孙(指孙元良——引者注)兵团、会攻徐州之形势,亦即从我军会战重点之西南面斩断敌人中枢方法,收效极大。”第三天,毛泽东就为中央军委起草致陈邓并告粟陈张(指粟裕、陈士榘、张震——引者注)电,提出在宿蚌地区作战的两个方案,“何者为宜,望酌复”。7日,粟陈张报告,“如中原军歼灭刘汝明部作战已经完成,则建议以主力直出津浦路徐蚌段……截断徐敌退路,使李、邱(指李弥、邱清泉——引者注)兵团不能南撤”。9日,毛泽东为中央军委连续起草两个电报,前一个电报,要求“陈邓直接指挥各部,包括一、三、四、九纵队应直出宿县,截断宿蚌路”。后一个电报更明确地指出:“齐辰电(指粟裕、张震11月8日电——引者注)悉。应极力争取在徐州附近歼灭敌人主力,勿使南窜。华东、华北、中原三方面应用全力保证我军的供给。”淮海战役的全盘战略设想,就是在中央军委同前线各将领根据实际情况经过反复磋商后确定的。中原野战军参谋长李达评论道:“军委、毛主席善于采纳前线指挥员的建议,及时修改计划,适应已经变化的情况,并再次重申给予总前委刘陈邓(指刘伯承、陈毅、邓小平——引者注)‘临机处置’之权,这是淮海战役所以能顺利发展并取得全胜的一个重要原因。”军情本来是异常紧迫的,但在决策酝酿阶段或情况许可时,毛泽东总是同前方将领反复磋商,听取他们的意见,然后作出决断;在决策已定而情况紧急时,又要求前方将领一切由他们“临机处置,不要请示”。这在蒋介石的作战指挥中是没有的。中国共产党提倡:在民主基础上的集中,在集中指导下的民主。三大战略决战过程中,解放军最高统帅部和前方将领间在这方面确实达到了水乳交融的地步。这里还要讲一讲周恩来在三大战略决战中发挥的特殊作用。1947年3月国民党军队进攻延安后,人民解放军总参谋长彭德怀担负起西北解放军的指挥工作,以少数兵力抗击胡宗南部队的进攻。那时,毛泽东、周恩来、任弼时带了一支八百人的小队伍转战陕北。适应当时的紧张局势,这个时期中共中央的领导是高度集中的,在中央决定问题的只是毛、周、任三个人。周恩来后来对外宾说:“在中央只有三个人,毛泽东、周恩来与任弼时同志。所谓中央,就是这三个人嘛!”在他们转战陕北的一年内,刘邓大军千里跃进大别山,人民解放军从战略防御转入战略进攻,战争形势发展之快是惊人的。新中国成立后不久,毛泽东曾说过:“胡宗南进攻延安以后,在陕北,我和周恩来、任弼时同志在两个窑洞指挥了全国的战争。”周恩来接着说:“毛主席是在世界上最小的司令部里,指挥了最大的人民解放战争。”他没有提到自己,但他在其中所起的作用是不言自明的。三大战略决战时,中共中央已集中在河北西柏坡,周恩来继续担任着中央军委副主席兼代总参谋长。他的工作是最忙碌的。每晚都是工作到次日凌晨才去睡觉,到上午9时又准时起床,一天不过休息5个小时。他和毛泽东住的院子靠得很近,随时见面,一有什么问题,两人就交换意见,商议解决办法。上世纪80年代初,笔者曾访问当时在周恩来身边工作的张清化。他说:那时军事上的问题,主要是由毛泽东和周恩来商量解决。毛泽东是挂帅的,周恩来参与决策,并具体组织实施。除了军委作战部外,周恩来还有个小作战室,由张清化任主任,相当于他的军事秘书。每天根据局势的变化负责标图。周恩来经常到军委作战室了解情况。他对敌我双方的战争态势、兵力部署、部队特点、战斗力强弱,以至国民党方面指挥官的简历、性格等,可以说了如指掌。有了什么情况,周恩来总是仔细地核实并弄清,然后向毛泽东报告。两人经过研究确定对策后,多数由毛泽东起草文电,少数由周恩来起草,而所有军事方面的文电都经周恩来签发。从中央档案馆保存的当时军事方面的文电来看,由于军情紧急,除很少数经过书记处五位书记共同商议后作出决定外,其他大多数是毛泽东和周恩来商议后为中央军委起草发出的。发出时大抵是两种情况:一种,比较多的是在文电上由毛泽东或周恩来批有“刘、朱、任阅后发”,经三人圈阅后发出;另一种,军情特别紧迫时,就批有“发后送刘、朱、任阅”。由于文电都是毛、周两人共同商议后用军委名义起草的,不能说毛泽东起草的只是毛泽东一个人的意见,只有周恩来起草的才是周恩来的意见。在重大战略问题上,究竟哪些意见是周恩来提出的,由于当时只有他们两人商议,没有别人在场,现在已难以辨别,以后恐怕也无法再说清楚了。还有一点需要说明:军事从来不能同经济、政治、文化等因素分割开来孤立地考察。李德·哈特说:“胜利是累积而成的。在此,所有武器包括军事、经济以及心理皆有所贡献。胜利的获得,唯靠善用与整合现代国家中一切既存资源。成功则需依赖各种行动的圆满协调。”毛泽东在军事指导中的一个重要特点,是他始终把军事同经济、政治、文化等诸多因素作为一个整体,综合起来考察,在此基础上作出判断和决策。关于蒋介石蒋介石是一名军人,先后在保定军官学校和日本士官学校学习过。在大陆期间,他任职最久的职务是军事委员会委员长,很多人往往用“委员长”这个称呼来代表他。毛泽东曾说过:“蒋介石代替孙中山,创造了国民党的全盛的军事时代。他看军队如生命。”“有军则有权,战争解决一切,这个基点,他是抓得很紧的。”但从他一生来看,长于政治权术,军事指挥能力却未见高明。埃德加·斯诺在1936年7月9日问曾同蒋介石在黄埔军校共过事、对蒋十分了解的周恩来:“你对蒋介石作为一个军人,看法如何?”周恩来回答:“不怎么样。作为一个战术家,他是拙劣的外行,而作为一个战略家则或许好一点。”“他的政治意识比军事意识强,这是他能争取其他军阀的原因。”细看国民党各派的内战中,蒋介石先后打败李宗仁、冯玉祥、唐生智、阎锡山、十九路军、陈济棠等,主要依靠的是政治分化和金钱收买,而没有表现出高超的战略指导和作战指挥能力。衡量一个军事统帅是不是具有远大的战略眼光和驾驭复杂多变局势的能力,至少可以从两方面来考察:第一,他能不能对全局客观情况的发展变化及时掌握,清醒地作出正确的判断,并且预见到下一步可能的发展;第二,他能不能针对面前的实际情况制定明确而有效的决策,除非情况发生重大变化决不轻易动摇或改变,而不是头痛医头、脚痛医脚地忙于应付,也不会因某些次要情况的变动就轻易地一再改变决心。从三大战略决战的实践检验中可以看出,蒋介石对这两个条件,都不具备:既不知己,也不知彼,目光短浅,反复多变,被动应付,顾此失彼,而且始终自以为是,出了错只怪部下无能或没有执行他的指示。这些都是军事统帅的大忌,他在平时都有表现,而在辽沈、淮海、平津这些决定命运的战略决战中暴露得格外突出。可是,国民党军队的作战指挥大权却一直紧紧抓在他一个人手里,都要由他来作决断。深得蒋介石信任的外交部长王世杰在1948年初的日记中写道:“目前国防部实际上全由蒋先生负责,诸事殊乏分责之人。”能对蒋介石的作战指挥有近距离观察的杜聿明,在回忆淮海战役中黄维兵团被歼的经过时更具体地说:“先是蒋介石对解放军估计过低,将自己估计过高,幻想不增加兵力,南北夹攻,打通津浦路徐蚌段;继而见解放军声势浩大,战力坚强,阵地森严,非国民党军可破,于是决心放弃徐州,以仅有的残部保卫南京。等到徐州部队出来后,蒋又被解放军的战略运动迷惑(误认为解放军撤退),再改变决心,令从徐州退却中之国民党军回师向解放军攻击,协同李延年兵团解黄维之围。黄维兵团就是这样地套在解放军既设的口袋内,被重重包围,战力日益消耗,包围圈逐渐缩小。一直战到十二月十日以后,蒋介石才发现从徐、蚌出来的国民党军都没有击退解放军的希望,于是决心要黄维在空军和毒气掩护下白天突围,黄维则认为白天无法突围。双方争执到十五日晚,黄维见情势危急,于是夜间突围。黄维一经突围,在解放军的天罗地网下土崩瓦解,除胡琏个人乘战车只身脱逃外,全部被歼。事后蒋介石给我的信中,怪黄维不听他的命令在空军毒气掩护下突围,而擅令夜间突围,是自取灭亡。”时任南京政府副总统的李宗仁在海外口述的回忆录中说:“蒋先生既不长于将兵,亦不长于将将。但是他却喜欢坐在统帅部里,直接以电话指挥前方作战。”“蒋先生的判断既不正确,主张又不坚定。往往军队调到一半,他忽然又改变了主意,益发使前线紊乱。蒋先生之所以要这样做,实在是因为他未作过中、下级军官,无战场上的实际经验,只是坐在高级指挥部里,全凭一时心血来潮,揣测行事,指挥系统就乱了。”这个评论是很中肯的。李宗仁又说:“凡是中央系统的将领都知道蒋先生这项毛病。他们知道奉行蒋先生的命令,往往要吃败仗,但是如不听他的命令,出了乱子,便更不得了。所以大家索性自己不出主意,让委员长直接指挥,吃了败仗由最高统帅自己负责,大家落得没有责任。将领如果是这样的庸才,当然不能打胜仗,而蒋先生偏偏喜欢这样的人。”国民党军方在台湾出版的《国民革命军战役史第五部——戡乱》的第九册“总检讨”中,在“野战战略”部分检讨说:“斯时国军中高级指挥机构,在考量匪我双方战力时,常以装备为评估战力惟一之因素”,“上下皆以收复或攻占地域为目标,主从颠倒,违背用兵原则。”而在“统帅节度”部分也作了多处检讨:“(一)过分干预下级,使下级无从发挥其自身指挥能力。长此以往,易于使下级逐渐失去自主及应变能力。(二)各地区战略构想及指挥,由统帅部决定,不易切合战场状况变化。故易陷于被动,尤其重要会战或决战指导,战机呈显之时间短暂,如等待上级决定后再采行动时易失战机。战场陷于危机时,若等待上级之决定,亦难以及时挽救。(三)统帅部所决定之各地区作战构想及指导,系基于上层人员之判断而产生者,与战场实际情况,难免有所隔阂,在研议过程中,亦不征询下级意见,又不重视战场指挥官之意见具申,故所决定之各案,往往与作战部队之实况及能力不相吻合,致战略难以取得战术之充分支持。”这里虽然都没有提蒋介石的名字,分析也有避重就轻之处,但由于蒋介石对军事指挥大权一人独揽,这里多次提到的“统帅部”的过失,其实更多地反映出蒋介石作为军事统帅的严重弱点。郝柏村在解读蒋介石日记时写道:“剿共作战一直是蒋公亲自决策,两任参谋总长陈诚与顾祝同,只是执行蒋公的政策而已。”蒋介石最信任的陈诚对此也有抱怨。郝柏村写道:“蒋公与参谋总长陈诚间之歧见,在本日日记中表露。我以客观立场评析,主因当为蒋公对进剿作战计划批示过多,干预过细,将领不能不服从,陈诚亦然。当战事受挫,参谋总长责无旁贷,难免对蒋公抱怨,这是陈诚的个性。”可见,三大战略决战中国民党军队战略指导的拙劣,其主要责任只能归之于蒋介石。辽沈、淮海、平津三大战略决战,对蒋介石的军事指挥才能是一次严格的检验。可以看到,他的作战指导实在缺乏章法,并且严重地脱离实际,先是对战场局势缺乏客观而全面的分析和了解,更谈不上对它的发展趋势有足够的预见,没有经过深思熟虑、明确而坚定的作战预案;临事张皇失措,被动应付,而又主观武断,甚至在辽沈战役和淮海战役的中后期依然盲目地想同解放军在不利条件下“决战”;继而决心动摇,终致束手无策,多次慨叹“此事殊出意外”,只能“默祷恳求上帝默佑”。他在1949年2月25日的日记中写道:“对共匪不能有所期待,而以阻止其渡江为惟一要务。”他已提不出其他办法,但他的主要军事力量既已失去,被他视为“惟一要务”的“阻止其渡江”又怎么做得到呢?1948年12月30日,毛泽东发表《将革命进行到底》。1949年4月21日,毛泽东和朱德联合发表《向全国进军的命令》。至此,中国革命在全国的胜利可以说大局已定了。(作者系原中共中央文献研究室常务副主任、中国史学会原会长、研究员)文章来源:《党的文献》2013年第1期\n\n[要求]

"什么是战略决战?就是指对战争全局有决定意义的战役,通常表现为交战双方的主力会战,因为只有在会战中歼灭对方的主力,才能最终决定战争的胜负。在全国解放战争中,战略决战就是辽沈、淮海、平津三大战役。正因为战略决战对战争全局起着决定性作用,是战争的真正重心所在,双方的军事统帅不能不全力以赴地为争取真正的胜利而投入这场斗争。又因为它是双方主力的会战,在整个战争过程中是最激烈、最复杂、最变化多端的阶段,在指挥上也是最不容易驾驭的时刻。对军事统帅来说,战略决战是检验他的战略眼光、驾驭复杂局势的能力以及决心和意志力的最好试金石。这里包括:他能不能总揽全局地正确判断客观战争局势的发展;能不能敢于在适当时机下常人难以决断的最大决心,排除种种困难,坚决贯彻实行;能不能灵活地应对战场上出现的可以预见或难以预见的重要变化,随机应变,及时调整部署;能不能巧妙地从战役的这一阶段向下一阶段发展,如此等等。可以说,战略决战在相当程度上也是双方军事统帅指挥作战能力的较量。较量中孰优孰劣,空言争辩是没有用的,一切只能靠战争实践的事实来检验。当然,战略决战的胜败不能单纯从军事这一个角度来考察,它通常有深刻的社会原因,同政治、经济、思想、文化等诸多因素交织在一起,特别是由人心向背这一根本因素所支配,但军事统帅的主观指挥是否正确无疑也起着极为重要的作用。毛泽东曾着重指出这一点:“我要优势和主动,敌人也要这个,从这点上看,战争就是两军指挥员以军力财力等项物质基础作地盘,互争优势和主动的主观能力的竞赛。竞赛结果,有胜有败,除了客观物质条件的比较外,胜者必由于主观指挥的正确,败者必由于主观指挥的错误。”他还指出:“战争是力量的竞赛,但力量在战争过程中变化其原来的形态。在这里,主观的努力,多打胜仗,少犯错误,是决定的因素。客观因素具备着这种变化的可能性,但实现这种可能性,就需要正确的方针和主观的努力。这时候,主观作用是决定的了。”他在这短短的一段话里连用了两次“决定”这个词,来加强语气。战争的胜败,从根本上说,自然取决于客观因素是否具备,取决于人心的向背,取决于胜利一方各级将领、战士以及民众的共同努力,而有了这些条件以后,军事统帅的作战指导是否正确,无疑可以起“决定”作用。对抗双方的统帅,在战略决战中总是竭尽自己的全力进行较量。双方又各拥有一定的实力,力图取胜,否则也没有什么“决战”可言。这就使历史的发展显得波澜起伏,险象环生。最后,一方胜利了,一方失败了。双方统帅的高下和优劣,在这种较量的检验中,表现得远比其他时候更为明显。从而,能激起人们对研究它的浓厚兴趣。笔者常感觉:研究中国共产党在革命时期的历史,必须同时研究国民党,而研究这个时期国民党的历史,也必须研究共产党,注意它们之间的互动关系。如果只把眼光始终对着其中的一个方面,就难以对那段历史有全面的了解。记得在高中读书时,课外看过梁启超的《中国历史研究法》和它的《续编》。有一段话给笔者留下很深的印象。他说:“我们看李瀚章做的《曾文正公年谱》,实在不能满足我们这种欲望。因为他只叙谱主本身的命令举动,只叙清廷指挥擢黜谕旨,其余一切只有带叙,从不专提,使得我们看了,好像从墙隙中观墙外的争斗,不知他们为什么有胜有负!虽然篇幅有十二卷之多,实际上还不够用。倘然有人高兴改做,倒是很好的事情;但千万别忘记旧谱的短处,最要详尽的了解太平天国的一切大事,同时要把人的相互关系,把当时的背景写个明白,才了解曾国藩的全体如何。”这段话是60多年前读的,但梁启超所说的“从墙隙中观墙外的争斗,不知他们为什么有胜有负”那几句话,至今不忘。还可以打个比喻:看人下棋,一定要同时看双方分别如何布局,如何下子。棋局中变化多端,充满着未知数和变数,还要看一方走出什么别人原来没有料到的一着棋时,另一方又是如何应对的,应对的是对还是错。这样才能看懂这局棋。如果眼睛只盯着一方的布局和下子而不看对方,那就根本无法看懂这局棋,甚至也无法真正看懂你所关注的那一方为什么胜利或失败。在战争史中,双方统帅如何统筹全局、作出判断、布局下子,如何处理战争进程中那些异常复杂而有关键意义的问题,他们的领导能力究竟怎样,后果又是如何,常常引起人们的特别兴趣。下面,就毛泽东和蒋介石在三大战略决战中的作战指导,分别作一点综合的考察。关于毛泽东毛泽东本来不是军人。他自己说过:“我是一个知识分子,当一个小学教员,也没学过军事,怎么知道打仗呢?就是由于国民党搞白色恐怖,把工会、农会都打掉了,把五万共产党员杀了一大批,抓了一大批,我们才拿起枪来,上山打游击。”既然如此,为什么毛泽东会成长为一位出色的军事统帅?他的办法是“从战争中学习战争”。这有两层意思:一是要投身到战争实践中去,否则就谈不上从战争中学习战争;二是要在战争实践中用心去想,不断总结实践中成功的经验和失败的教训,用来校正自己的认识和行动,并且把战争中遇到的重要问题提到较高的原则性上去思考和解决,这就是研究战略问题。陈毅曾对毛泽东的军事思想作过这样的概括:“其特点是以实事求是的方法去研究中国战争的实际,去发现和掌握中国革命军事的总规律。”陈毅说得很对。实事求是,确实是毛泽东军事思想的精髓。在战争中,他总是力求熟识敌我双方各方面的情况,使作战的部署和指挥尽量适合当时当地的情况,使主观的指导和客观的实际情况相符合,做那些实际上可能做到的事情,而不是只凭主观愿望去瞎指挥,更不是只说一大堆空话。这是他在战争中所以能克敌制胜的关键所在。当然,对客观事物的认识不可能一次完成,在战争中尤其如此。他清醒地看到:“统统相符合的事,在战争或战斗中是极其少有的,这是因为战争或战斗的双方是成群的武装着的活人,而又互相保持秘密的缘故,这和处置日常事件是大不相同的。然而只要做到指挥大体上适合情况,即在有决定意义的部分适合情况,那就是胜利的基础了。”他对军事统帅如何才能正确地指挥作战的思考和实行过程作了具体而清晰的叙述:“指挥员的正确的部署来源于正确的决心,正确的决心来源于正确的判断,正确的判断来源于周到的和必要的侦察,和对于各种侦察材料的联贯起来的思索。指挥员使用一切可能的和必要的侦察手段,将侦察得来的敌方情况的各种材料加以去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里的思索,然后将自己方面的情况加上去,研究双方的对比和相互的关系,因而构成判断,定下决心,作出计划,——这是军事家在作出每一个战略、战役或战斗的计划之前的一个整个的认识情况的过程。粗心大意的军事家,不去这样做,把军事计划建立在一相情愿的基础之上,这种计划是空想的,不符合于实际的。”“认识情况的过程,不但存在于军事计划建立之前,而且存在于军事计划建立之后。当执行某一计划时,从开始执行起,到战局终结止,这是又一个认识情况的过程,即实行的过程。此时,第一个过程中的东西是否符合于实况,需要重新加以检查。如果计划和情况不符合,或者不完全符合,就必须依照新的认识,构成新的判断,定下新的决心,把已定计划加以改变,使之适合于新的情况。部分地改变的事差不多每一作战都是有的,全部地改变的事也是间或有的。鲁莽家不知改变,或不愿改变,只是一味盲干,结果又非碰壁不可。”这两段话是毛泽东在1936年12月写的,而他在12年后的三大战略决战时作为中国人民解放军最高统帅时也是这样思考和践行的。正确判断战争全局的客观形势,是中国人民解放军决定发动三大战略决战的出发点和基本依据。到1948年8月,正确选择决战时机已成为刻不容缓的问题。解放战争两年来国民党军有生力量被大量消灭,双方力量对比已发生巨大变化。国民党当局正在考虑撤退东北、确保华中的问题,但仍举棋不定。叶剑英写道:“在这种情况下,究竟是让敌人实现他们把现有兵力撤至关内或江南的计划,使我们失去时机,从而增加我军尔后作战的麻烦呢?还是在敌人还没有来得及决策逃跑之前,我们就当机立断,抓住大好时机,组织战略决战,各个消灭敌人的强大战略集团呢?机不可失,时不再来。毛泽东同志根据对战争形势的科学分析,毅然决然地抓住了这个战略决战时机,先后组织了辽沈、淮海、平津三大战役。”在兵力还没有超过对方的条件下,综合各方面因素的考虑,下决心发动战略决战,需要有大智大勇。这也是蒋介石没有料到、因而在事先也没有作出应对准备、结果处处陷于被动挨打的重要原因。抓住决战时机后,确定决战方向十分重要。既要全局在胸,又要正确地选择从何着手,接着如何一步一步发展,直至达到预期的目标。这对军事统帅的指挥能力是一个重要考验。毛泽东历来强调:“一战而胜,再及其余,各个击破,全局因而转成了优势,转成了主动。”他写道:“第一个战斗,关系非常之大。第一个战斗的胜败给予极大的影响于全局,乃至一直影响到最后的一个战斗。”怎样打好“第一个战斗”?毛泽东归纳了三条原则:“第一,必须打胜。必须敌情、地形、人民等条件,都利于我,不利于敌,确有把握而后动手。否则宁可退让,持重待机。机会总是有的,不可率尔应战”;“第二,初战的计划必须是全战役计划的有机的序幕。没有好的全战役计划,绝不能有真正好的第一仗”;“第三,还要想到下一战略阶段的文章。”“战略指导者当其处在一个战略阶段时,应该计算到往后多数阶段,至少也应计算到下一个阶段。尽管往后变化难测,愈远看愈渺茫,然而大体的计算是可能的,估计前途的远景是必要的。”“走一步应该看那一步的具体变化,据此以修改或发展自己战略战役计划,不这样做,就会弄出冒险直冲的错误。然而贯通全战略阶段乃至几个战略阶段的、大体上想通了的、一个长时期的方针,是决不可少的。”三大战略决战是从东北战场开始的。叶剑英描述了毛泽东的决策过程:“当时全国各战场的形势虽然在不同程度上都有利于人民解放军的作战,但敌人在战略上却企图尽量延长坚守东北几个孤立要点的时间,牵制我东北人民解放军,使我军不能入关作战;同时,敌人又准备把东北敌军撤至华中地区,加强华中防御。在这种情况下,如果我们把战略决战的方向,指向华北战场,则会使我军受到傅作义、卫立煌两大战略集团的夹击而陷于被动;如果我们把战略决战的方向首先指向华东战场,则会使东北敌人迅速撤退,而实现他们的战略收缩企图。因此,东北战场就成为全国战局发展的关键。”“决战首先从局部的形势开始,进而争取全局上的更大优势。由于迅速而顺利地取得了辽沈战役的胜利,就使全国战局急转直下,使原来预计的战争进程大为缩短。”作战方向确定后,为了取得理想的作战效果,毛泽东和中央军委在三大战略决战中几乎都采取了奇袭的作战方法。正如《孙子兵法·九地篇第十一》所说:“兵之情主速,由不虞之道,攻其所不戒也。”又如《孙子兵法·计篇第一》所说:“兵者,诡道也。”“攻其无备,出其不意。此兵家之胜,不可先传之。”英国军事学家李德·哈特也写道:“军事计划不用‘奇袭’这把永远管用的钥匙,失败就可能接踵而至,不现实的想法是替代不了这把钥匙的。”这句话大体上也是这个意思。要做到奇袭,并不容易。怎样才能使对方“无备”和“不意”呢?有两个重要条件:一是迅速,二是保密。有时还需要以佯动来造成对方的错觉。在三大战略决战中,初战几乎都采取奇袭的做法,先从对方“不意”的要地突然发动强有力的攻击,在它的防御链上打开一个大的缺口,使对方在部署和心理上都陷于异常慌乱的地步,再一步一步扩大战果,直到取得全局的胜利。拿辽沈战役来说,锦州的重要战略地位是谁都知道的。但当时东北野战军的主力和后方根据地都在北满,又采取了一些佯动,使国民党军误以为解放军会将进攻重点指向长春,而解放军主力却隐蔽地远途奔袭锦州地区,直到以突然行动包围义县并切断锦州同关内的陆路交通,才使蒋介石如梦初醒,慌忙地调整部署,陷入一片混乱。这可以称为奇袭。再看淮海战役,国民党军原来判断解放军会从西侧奔袭徐州,解放军又以多路佯动,增强对方这种错觉,从而将李弥兵团西调,孙元良兵团北调,集中在徐州周围。华东野战军主力立刻乘虚而入,隔断孤悬东侧的黄百韬兵团同徐州之联系,开始了淮海战役的“第一个战斗”。这就打乱了国民党军队在徐州地区的整个部署,随后,中原野战军同样乘虚而入,突袭宿县,切断徐州同蚌埠之间的联系,奠定淮海战役全胜的基础。这也是“攻其不备,出其不意”的奇袭。在平津战役中,国民党军的注意力最初集中在东面,提防东北野战军主力大举入关,蒋介石还要求把部队东移津沽,以备必要时从海路南撤。解放军却出其不意地从西线打起,让原在归绥的杨成武兵团和原在石家庄北面的杨得志兵团分别迅速包围张家口和新保安,将傅作义的注意力吸引到西边,顾不上东线。而东北野战军主力又提前行动,悄悄地越过长城南下,分割东面的北平、天津、塘沽之间的联系。尽管东北解放军不进行休整就开始秘密入关,但有如时任东北野战军第一兵团副司令员的陈伯钧所说:“这时我们对整个华北敌人的战略包围还未形成,我们在津塘方面的兵力还很不够,倘若过早对平津等地实行战役包围,对张家口、新保安、南口等地实行战役进攻,势必吓跑敌人,不利今后作战。除此而外,在辽沈战役结束之后,部队由于连续作战未及休整,又经过长途跋涉,来到关内,十分疲劳。”这些都需要有一定时间。因此,又采取“围而不打”和“隔而不围”这种战史上十分罕见的打法。在这过程中,也有许多奇袭的因素。像下棋一样,下好每一步重要的棋,都必须具有战略眼光,充分考虑这步棋会引起全局发生怎样的变化,乘势扩大战果,夺取全局的胜利。而在关键的地方,必须十分用心,考虑到多种可能性和切实的应对办法。毛泽东指出:“学习战争全局的指导规律,是要用心去想一想才行的。”“指挥全局的人,最要紧的,是把自己的注意力摆在照顾战争的全局上面。主要地是依据情况,照顾部队和兵团的组成问题,照顾两个战役之间的关系问题,照顾各个作战阶段之间的关系问题,照顾我方全部活动和敌方全部活动之间的关系问题,这些都是最吃力的地方,如果丢了这个去忙一些次要的问题,那就难免要吃亏了。”在毛泽东和中央军委指挥下,三大战略决战不是分散的、孤立的、各自进行的三个战役,而是有着通盘筹划,一环紧扣一环,相互照应,一气贯注的完整部署。对具体的作战方法,毛泽东在1947年12月会议上提出了著名的十项军事原则。其中,“集中优势兵力,各个歼灭敌人”是根本的方法。毛泽东很早就说过:“集中兵力看来容易,实行颇难。人人皆知以多胜少是最好的办法,然而很多人不能做,相反地每每分散兵力,原因就在于指导者缺乏战略头脑,为复杂的环境所迷惑,因而被环境所支配,失掉自主能力,采取了应付主义。”这种根本的作战方法,在毛泽东指导三大战略决战时得到了充分的运用。军事胜利从来不是单靠军队来实现的。人民战争更是如此。毛泽东一向强调“兵民是胜利之本”。三大战略决战能获得胜利,一个基本原因是民众的支持,不断以人力物力支援前线。拿淮海战役来说,中央军委决定“举行淮海战役,甚为必要”后三天,毛泽东就为中央军委起草电报指出:“这一战役必比济南战役规模要大,比睢杞战役的规模也可能要大。因此,你们必须有相当时间使攻济兵团获得休整补充,并对全军作战所需包括全部后勤工作在内有充分之准备方能开始行动。”战役开始后不久,周恩来又为中央军委起草致中原局、华北局、华东局电报,说明前线参战部队和民工近百万人,每月需粮约一亿斤,要求各地立即动手筹集并速调粮食供应前线。那时供应解放军前线的物资运送,几乎全靠肩挑背负、小车推送。粟裕回忆道:“参战部队加支前民工每日需粮数百万斤。加上天气寒冷,供应线长,运输不便。因此,粮食的供应,就成为淮海战役能否取胜的一个重要关键。为此,毛泽东同志一再指示我们,必须统筹解决全军连同民工一百三十万人三至五个月的口粮,以及弹药、草料和伤员的治疗等问题。华东局发出了‘全力以赴,支援前线’的指示,提出了‘解放军打到哪里,就支援到哪里’的口号,组成了华东支前委员会,进一步加强了对支前工作的统一领导。山东人民积极响应党的号召,省吃俭用,保证了部队用粮。”淮海战役后期的解放军阵地上,“粮足饭香,兵强马壮。待战役结束时,前方尚存余粮四千多万斤”。整个淮海战役中,共动员民工543万人次,运送弹药1460多万斤,粮食9亿6千万斤。陈毅深情地说:淮海战役的胜利是人民群众用小车推出来的。这同国民党军队屡屡弹尽粮绝,陷入绝境,成为他们多次覆没的重要原因,恰成鲜明的对照。能不能得到民众的全力支持,确实是战争能不能取得胜利的根本问题。毛泽东思想是集体智慧的结晶。在军事领域内,他十分重视处在第一线的将领们的意见,常同他们反复商议,认真听取并考虑他们的判断和建议。以淮海战役为例:它的发动,起于华东野战军代司令兼代政委粟裕在济南战役快结束时向中央军委“建议即进行淮海战役”第二天,毛泽东立即为中央军委起草复电:“我们认为举行淮海战役,甚为必要。”当华东野战军正准备分割包围黄百韬兵团时,留在大别山地区的中原野战军司令员刘伯承在1948年11月3日致电中央军委提出:“蒋军重兵守徐州,其补给线只一津浦路,怕我截断,……只要不是重大不利之变化,陈、邓(指陈毅、邓小平——引者注)主力似应力求截断徐、蚌间铁路,造成隔断孙(指孙元良——引者注)兵团、会攻徐州之形势,亦即从我军会战重点之西南面斩断敌人中枢方法,收效极大。”第三天,毛泽东就为中央军委起草致陈邓并告粟陈张(指粟裕、陈士榘、张震——引者注)电,提出在宿蚌地区作战的两个方案,“何者为宜,望酌复”。7日,粟陈张报告,“如中原军歼灭刘汝明部作战已经完成,则建议以主力直出津浦路徐蚌段……截断徐敌退路,使李、邱(指李弥、邱清泉——引者注)兵团不能南撤”。9日,毛泽东为中央军委连续起草两个电报,前一个电报,要求“陈邓直接指挥各部,包括一、三、四、九纵队应直出宿县,截断宿蚌路”。后一个电报更明确地指出:“齐辰电(指粟裕、张震11月8日电——引者注)悉。应极力争取在徐州附近歼灭敌人主力,勿使南窜。华东、华北、中原三方面应用全力保证我军的供给。”淮海战役的全盘战略设想,就是在中央军委同前线各将领根据实际情况经过反复磋商后确定的。中原野战军参谋长李达评论道:“军委、毛主席善于采纳前线指挥员的建议,及时修改计划,适应已经变化的情况,并再次重申给予总前委刘陈邓(指刘伯承、陈毅、邓小平——引者注)‘临机处置’之权,这是淮海战役所以能顺利发展并取得全胜的一个重要原因。”军情本来是异常紧迫的,但在决策酝酿阶段或情况许可时,毛泽东总是同前方将领反复磋商,听取他们的意见,然后作出决断;在决策已定而情况紧急时,又要求前方将领一切由他们“临机处置,不要请示”。这在蒋介石的作战指挥中是没有的。中国共产党提倡:在民主基础上的集中,在集中指导下的民主。三大战略决战过程中,解放军最高统帅部和前方将领间在这方面确实达到了水乳交融的地步。这里还要讲一讲周恩来在三大战略决战中发挥的特殊作用。1947年3月国民党军队进攻延安后,人民解放军总参谋长彭德怀担负起西北解放军的指挥工作,以少数兵力抗击胡宗南部队的进攻。那时,毛泽东、周恩来、任弼时带了一支八百人的小队伍转战陕北。适应当时的紧张局势,这个时期中共中央的领导是高度集中的,在中央决定问题的只是毛、周、任三个人。周恩来后来对外宾说:“在中央只有三个人,毛泽东、周恩来与任弼时同志。所谓中央,就是这三个人嘛!”在他们转战陕北的一年内,刘邓大军千里跃进大别山,人民解放军从战略防御转入战略进攻,战争形势发展之快是惊人的。新中国成立后不久,毛泽东曾说过:“胡宗南进攻延安以后,在陕北,我和周恩来、任弼时同志在两个窑洞指挥了全国的战争。”周恩来接着说:“毛主席是在世界上最小的司令部里,指挥了最大的人民解放战争。”他没有提到自己,但他在其中所起的作用是不言自明的。三大战略决战时,中共中央已集中在河北西柏坡,周恩来继续担任着中央军委副主席兼代总参谋长。他的工作是最忙碌的。每晚都是工作到次日凌晨才去睡觉,到上午9时又准时起床,一天不过休息5个小时。他和毛泽东住的院子靠得很近,随时见面,一有什么问题,两人就交换意见,商议解决办法。上世纪80年代初,笔者曾访问当时在周恩来身边工作的张清化。他说:那时军事上的问题,主要是由毛泽东和周恩来商量解决。毛泽东是挂帅的,周恩来参与决策,并具体组织实施。除了军委作战部外,周恩来还有个小作战室,由张清化任主任,相当于他的军事秘书。每天根据局势的变化负责标图。周恩来经常到军委作战室了解情况。他对敌我双方的战争态势、兵力部署、部队特点、战斗力强弱,以至国民党方面指挥官的简历、性格等,可以说了如指掌。有了什么情况,周恩来总是仔细地核实并弄清,然后向毛泽东报告。两人经过研究确定对策后,多数由毛泽东起草文电,少数由周恩来起草,而所有军事方面的文电都经周恩来签发。从中央档案馆保存的当时军事方面的文电来看,由于军情紧急,除很少数经过书记处五位书记共同商议后作出决定外,其他大多数是毛泽东和周恩来商议后为中央军委起草发出的。发出时大抵是两种情况:一种,比较多的是在文电上由毛泽东或周恩来批有“刘、朱、任阅后发”,经三人圈阅后发出;另一种,军情特别紧迫时,就批有“发后送刘、朱、任阅”。由于文电都是毛、周两人共同商议后用军委名义起草的,不能说毛泽东起草的只是毛泽东一个人的意见,只有周恩来起草的才是周恩来的意见。在重大战略问题上,究竟哪些意见是周恩来提出的,由于当时只有他们两人商议,没有别人在场,现在已难以辨别,以后恐怕也无法再说清楚了。还有一点需要说明:军事从来不能同经济、政治、文化等因素分割开来孤立地考察。李德·哈特说:“胜利是累积而成的。在此,所有武器包括军事、经济以及心理皆有所贡献。胜利的获得,唯靠善用与整合现代国家中一切既存资源。成功则需依赖各种行动的圆满协调。”毛泽东在军事指导中的一个重要特点,是他始终把军事同经济、政治、文化等诸多因素作为一个整体,综合起来考察,在此基础上作出判断和决策。关于蒋介石蒋介石是一名军人,先后在保定军官学校和日本士官学校学习过。在大陆期间,他任职最久的职务是军事委员会委员长,很多人往往用“委员长”这个称呼来代表他。毛泽东曾说过:“蒋介石代替孙中山,创造了国民党的全盛的军事时代。他看军队如生命。”“有军则有权,战争解决一切,这个基点,他是抓得很紧的。”但从他一生来看,长于政治权术,军事指挥能力却未见高明。埃德加·斯诺在1936年7月9日问曾同蒋介石在黄埔军校共过事、对蒋十分了解的周恩来:“你对蒋介石作为一个军人,看法如何?”周恩来回答:“不怎么样。作为一个战术家,他是拙劣的外行,而作为一个战略家则或许好一点。”“他的政治意识比军事意识强,这是他能争取其他军阀的原因。”细看国民党各派的内战中,蒋介石先后打败李宗仁、冯玉祥、唐生智、阎锡山、十九路军、陈济棠等,主要依靠的是政治分化和金钱收买,而没有表现出高超的战略指导和作战指挥能力。衡量一个军事统帅是不是具有远大的战略眼光和驾驭复杂多变局势的能力,至少可以从两方面来考察:第一,他能不能对全局客观情况的发展变化及时掌握,清醒地作出正确的判断,并且预见到下一步可能的发展;第二,他能不能针对面前的实际情况制定明确而有效的决策,除非情况发生重大变化决不轻易动摇或改变,而不是头痛医头、脚痛医脚地忙于应付,也不会因某些次要情况的变动就轻易地一再改变决心。从三大战略决战的实践检验中可以看出,蒋介石对这两个条件,都不具备:既不知己,也不知彼,目光短浅,反复多变,被动应付,顾此失彼,而且始终自以为是,出了错只怪部下无能或没有执行他的指示。这些都是军事统帅的大忌,他在平时都有表现,而在辽沈、淮海、平津这些决定命运的战略决战中暴露得格外突出。可是,国民党军队的作战指挥大权却一直紧紧抓在他一个人手里,都要由他来作决断。深得蒋介石信任的外交部长王世杰在1948年初的日记中写道:“目前国防部实际上全由蒋先生负责,诸事殊乏分责之人。”能对蒋介石的作战指挥有近距离观察的杜聿明,在回忆淮海战役中黄维兵团被歼的经过时更具体地说:“先是蒋介石对解放军估计过低,将自己估计过高,幻想不增加兵力,南北夹攻,打通津浦路徐蚌段;继而见解放军声势浩大,战力坚强,阵地森严,非国民党军可破,于是决心放弃徐州,以仅有的残部保卫南京。等到徐州部队出来后,蒋又被解放军的战略运动迷惑(误认为解放军撤退),再改变决心,令从徐州退却中之国民党军回师向解放军攻击,协同李延年兵团解黄维之围。黄维兵团就是这样地套在解放军既设的口袋内,被重重包围,战力日益消耗,包围圈逐渐缩小。一直战到十二月十日以后,蒋介石才发现从徐、蚌出来的国民党军都没有击退解放军的希望,于是决心要黄维在空军和毒气掩护下白天突围,黄维则认为白天无法突围。双方争执到十五日晚,黄维见情势危急,于是夜间突围。黄维一经突围,在解放军的天罗地网下土崩瓦解,除胡琏个人乘战车只身脱逃外,全部被歼。事后蒋介石给我的信中,怪黄维不听他的命令在空军毒气掩护下突围,而擅令夜间突围,是自取灭亡。”时任南京政府副总统的李宗仁在海外口述的回忆录中说:“蒋先生既不长于将兵,亦不长于将将。但是他却喜欢坐在统帅部里,直接以电话指挥前方作战。”“蒋先生的判断既不正确,主张又不坚定。往往军队调到一半,他忽然又改变了主意,益发使前线紊乱。蒋先生之所以要这样做,实在是因为他未作过中、下级军官,无战场上的实际经验,只是坐在高级指挥部里,全凭一时心血来潮,揣测行事,指挥系统就乱了。”这个评论是很中肯的。李宗仁又说:“凡是中央系统的将领都知道蒋先生这项毛病。他们知道奉行蒋先生的命令,往往要吃败仗,但是如不听他的命令,出了乱子,便更不得了。所以大家索性自己不出主意,让委员长直接指挥,吃了败仗由最高统帅自己负责,大家落得没有责任。将领如果是这样的庸才,当然不能打胜仗,而蒋先生偏偏喜欢这样的人。”国民党军方在台湾出版的《国民革命军战役史第五部——戡乱》的第九册“总检讨”中,在“野战战略”部分检讨说:“斯时国军中高级指挥机构,在考量匪我双方战力时,常以装备为评估战力惟一之因素”,“上下皆以收复或攻占地域为目标,主从颠倒,违背用兵原则。”而在“统帅节度”部分也作了多处检讨:“(一)过分干预下级,使下级无从发挥其自身指挥能力。长此以往,易于使下级逐渐失去自主及应变能力。(二)各地区战略构想及指挥,由统帅部决定,不易切合战场状况变化。故易陷于被动,尤其重要会战或决战指导,战机呈显之时间短暂,如等待上级决定后再采行动时易失战机。战场陷于危机时,若等待上级之决定,亦难以及时挽救。(三)统帅部所决定之各地区作战构想及指导,系基于上层人员之判断而产生者,与战场实际情况,难免有所隔阂,在研议过程中,亦不征询下级意见,又不重视战场指挥官之意见具申,故所决定之各案,往往与作战部队之实况及能力不相吻合,致战略难以取得战术之充分支持。”这里虽然都没有提蒋介石的名字,分析也有避重就轻之处,但由于蒋介石对军事指挥大权一人独揽,这里多次提到的“统帅部”的过失,其实更多地反映出蒋介石作为军事统帅的严重弱点。郝柏村在解读蒋介石日记时写道:“剿共作战一直是蒋公亲自决策,两任参谋总长陈诚与顾祝同,只是执行蒋公的政策而已。”蒋介石最信任的陈诚对此也有抱怨。郝柏村写道:“蒋公与参谋总长陈诚间之歧见,在本日日记中表露。我以客观立场评析,主因当为蒋公对进剿作战计划批示过多,干预过细,将领不能不服从,陈诚亦然。当战事受挫,参谋总长责无旁贷,难免对蒋公抱怨,这是陈诚的个性。”可见,三大战略决战中国民党军队战略指导的拙劣,其主要责任只能归之于蒋介石。辽沈、淮海、平津三大战略决战,对蒋介石的军事指挥才能是一次严格的检验。可以看到,他的作战指导实在缺乏章法,并且严重地脱离实际,先是对战场局势缺乏客观而全面的分析和了解,更谈不上对它的发展趋势有足够的预见,没有经过深思熟虑、明确而坚定的作战预案;临事张皇失措,被动应付,而又主观武断,甚至在辽沈战役和淮海战役的中后期依然盲目地想同解放军在不利条件下“决战”;继而决心动摇,终致束手无策,多次慨叹“此事殊出意外”,只能“默祷恳求上帝默佑”。他在1949年2月25日的日记中写道:“对共匪不能有所期待,而以阻止其渡江为惟一要务。”他已提不出其他办法,但他的主要军事力量既已失去,被他视为“惟一要务”的“阻止其渡江”又怎么做得到呢?1948年12月30日,毛泽东发表《将革命进行到底》。1949年4月21日,毛泽东和朱德联合发表《向全国进军的命令》。至此,中国革命在全国的胜利可以说大局已定了。(作者系原中共中央文献研究室常务副主任、中国史学会原会长、研究员)文章来源:《党的文献》2013年第1期"}

Schooling在看完剧本后撤回了拍片许可。\n俄勒冈州尤金的俄勒冈大学校长William Beaty Boyd曾于1966年在加利福尼亚大学柏克莱分校担任高阶行政人员，当时他的校园被选为电影《毕业生》（1967年）的取景地。在博伊德咨询了其他高阶行政同事之后，由于缺乏艺术价值而建议他将其拒绝，而使《毕业生》中柏克莱大学的校园场景是在南加州大学拍摄。《毕业生》之后成为了经典，当制片人询问是某能在俄勒冈大学中拍摄时，博伊德决心不犯两次相同的错误。与学生会领袖和Pan Hellenic Council兄弟会的干事协商后，大学关系总监（Director of University Relations）告诉校长，该剧本虽然不修边幅且多半庸俗，但却是对大学生活的趣味恶搞。博伊德甚至允许将自己的办公室当作沃梅主任的办公室场景。\n被选为当作达泰之家的房屋原是位于尤金的Dr. A.W. Patterson House。1959年左右，它被Phi Sigma Kappa兄弟会的Psi Deuteron分会收购，并一直作为他们的分会场，直到1967年，由于该分会的会员人数少而关闭了该分会。房子被拍卖后，处于闲置且失修的状态，如宽敞的门廊被拆除、草地铺满碎石。此外，当在此拍摄电影时，Phi Kappa Psi和Sigma Nu兄弟会的房子位于东第11大道700街区的Phi Sigma Kappa的旧房子旁边。Phi Sigma Kappa房屋和Sigma Nu房屋的内部用于许多室内场景，但每个房间都是在录音棚中拍摄。Patterson的房子在1977年拍摄结束后仍处于闲置状态，并于1986年被拆除。现址（scale:5000）现由西北基督大学的教育与咨询学校占用。停车场入口西侧的一块巨石上摆放著一块青铜色的牌匾，以纪念达泰之家的位置。凯萨琳·威尔森（Katherine Wilson）是《动物屋》的场地勘查员，她于2018年受访时表示，Sigma Nu地下室正是片中Toga party的拍摄地；如今，西北基督大学将其地下室上锁。返校游行场景是在科蒂奇格罗夫市中心约20英里（30公里）、连接著通过尤金的南5号州际公路俄勒冈州段的大街上拍摄。\n=== 拍摄 ===\n主要拍摄于1977年秋季开始进行，且兰迪斯要求饰演达泰的演员们提早五天到场，以彼此培养感情。他们住在附近位于斯普林菲尔德的Rodeway Inn汽车旅馆，还将一架旧钢琴从大厅搬到了布鲁斯·麦吉尔的房间，这是他们在一起交流的「派对中心」。James Widdoes回忆说：「就像大一新生一样。彼此之间有了很多认识，且以我们的角色名称互相称呼。」这种策略也鼓励饰演达泰的演员与饰演欧米茄的演员分开，从而在镜头上产生真实的敌意感。在拍摄期间，贝鲁西和他的妻子茱蒂（Judy）在尤金南部租了一间房子，好让他远离酒精和毒品；当贝鲁西通勤前往纽约市进行《周六夜现场》演出时，她仍留在俄勒冈州。\n演员们被警告别与大学生混在一起；某晚，一些女孩还是邀请了其中几个演员参加兄弟会派对，演员们答应邀请，但却在派对上受到公开的敌意。这群人明显不受到欢迎，正当他们离开时，威道斯朝一群喝醉的Oregon Ducks football队员扔了杯啤酒，使一场宛如「电影场面」般的斗争一触即发。提姆·麦特森、麦吉尔、彼得·瑞格特和威道斯险些逃脱；麦吉尔在过程中留下了青肿的眼眶，威道斯则掉了几颗牙齿。隔日从纽约抵达此处的贝鲁西曾说要向该兄弟会报复，但众人被阻劝。\n除了贝鲁西挑起开打的大吼外，片中自助餐厅的食物大战是一次性拍摄，演员们被鼓励真实上演。此外，贝鲁西在自助餐厅中即兴创作了许多桥段，如将一堆食物堆放在托盘上，这获得了兰迪斯的赏识。秀逗（Flounder，Stephen Furst饰演）在超市里接东西的场景则是另一回事；弗斯特巧妙地兰迪斯和麦特森扔给他的许多物品，使导演惊叹不已。兰迪斯在一天内将费时的法庭戏完成，让他在与艾凡·瑞特曼的赌注中胜出。\n在尤金拍摄的三十二天大多集中于11月完成。由于电影的预算太少，同一台摄影机平均每天得重复使用三十五次；此外，兰迪斯没有自己的拖车或办公室，且连续三周无法观看Dailies。他的妻子黛博拉·纳杜尔曼在当地的二手店购买了大多数服装，她和贝鲁西的妻子茱蒂还布置了宽袍派对的场景。片中虽然有大量饮酒的桥段，但麦特森表示那些都是低醇啤酒和茶notetag|片中的一个知名场景是贝鲁西一口气喝完一瓶杰克丹尼，但瓶内实际装的是冰茶而非真正的酒。，且兰迪斯严格禁止演员们在拍片期间吸毒、饮酒。此外，兰迪斯与麦吉尔为了造访片场的记者们演了一出戏，导演假装因演员在演戏时遇上困难而动怒。兰迪斯还将一个龟裂的罐子砸在麦吉尔的头上。他跌倒在地，假装失去知觉。记者们完全上了当；当他要麦吉尔起来时，对方则赖著不动。\n迪特湖俱乐部（摄于2011年）\n由于尤金附近太荒凉，黑人临时演员们不得不从波特兰搭公车前往迪特湖俱乐部（Dexter Lake Club，-122.8115）。更严重的是，俱乐部一段的剧情惊动了环球高管内德·塔南和其他片商的主管，他认为这段涉及种族主义并提出警告：「如果你将这段留在片中，在美国的黑人会离席并走出戏院。」但该片段在知名黑人演员李察·普瑞尔的批准下得以保留在片中。\n《动物屋》的原剪辑时长达175分钟，而删除时长超过一个小时；删除的场景包括：\n* 约翰·兰迪斯在片中客串了一名自助餐厅洗碗工，他试图阻止布托吃掉所有食物，两人为此引起了争执。\n* 布恩和胡佛告诉斑马，达泰过去传奇成员们的故事。\n* 奥图与几个女友在一起的两个片段（其中一人为电影场勘凯萨琳·威尔森饰演）。\n* 布托将芥末倒在自己身上并开始演唱〈我是芥末人〉（I am the Mustard Man）一片段的加长版。\n== 音乐 ==\n《动物屋》的配乐由作曲家埃尔默·伯恩斯坦所创作，他在配乐中结合了摇滚和节奏布鲁斯；他在约翰·兰迪斯还小时就是兰迪斯家庭的朋友。兰迪斯很认真地要他来为该片作曲，伯恩斯坦很容易地被说服，但被片商质疑他是否适合粗俗喜剧；兰迪斯让伯恩斯坦表达出对喜剧的重视来使片商放心。伯恩斯坦将约翰内斯·勃拉姆斯的《Academic Festival Overture》改编成〈费博大学主题曲〉，并表示，该片为他的作曲生涯打开了一扇通往喜剧的门。\n该原声带于1978年以黑胶唱片发行，后于1998年发行CD。在2000年代后期，由于〈费博大学主题曲〉（Faber College Theme）与波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那国歌的相似之处而引起大众的关注。\n曲目列表\n片中的其他音乐还包括〈Theme from A Summer Place〉（马克斯·史坦纳作曲，Percy Faith和他的乐队演奏）、〈Who's Sorry Now?〉（Ted Snyder、Bert Kalmar和Harry Ruby作曲，Connie Francis演唱）和〈The Washington Post (march)〉（约翰·菲利普·苏沙作曲）和〈Tammy〉（Jay Livingston和Ray Evans作曲）。\n== 发行 ==\n《动物屋》由环球影业定于1978年7月28日美国上映。当瑞特曼向美国各个地区的主管和销售经理展示了在两天内剪成的10分钟电影制作片段后，加剧了片商对该片的热情。片商将二十份副本分发给了参与的厂商并获得正面的反响。《动物屋》在正式上映的四个月前于丹佛先行试映；在获得观众的喜爱后，制片人意识到该片将会成功。《动物屋》上映时，兰迪斯、威道斯和凯伦·艾伦在全美进行巡回宣传活动。环球影业花费了约450万美元在选定的大学校园宣传该片，促进学生号召自己的宽袍派对。马里兰大学学院市分校举办的宽袍派对吸引了大约2000人参加，而威斯康星大学麦迪逊分校则吸引了1万人，创下了《金氏世界纪录》。由于该片的影响，该派对在1978年和1979年期间成为大学校园中颇受欢迎的活动。\n== 反响 ==\n=== 评价 ===\n上映期间，《动物屋》在影评界获得的评价褒贬不一，但其魅力很快地被发觉，此后它被公认为1978年年度佳片之一。该片在汇总媒体网站烂番茄上根据50篇评论而持有90%的新鲜度，平均得分7.68／10；该网站共识：「导演约翰·兰迪斯的才华和《周六夜现场》不受控的约翰·贝鲁西共谋创造了一个暴躁、持续引起共鸣的颠覆性大学喜剧。」而在Metacritic上根据13篇评论则获得了79分，代表著「普遍正面的评价」。\n《芝加哥太阳报》的罗杰·伊伯特给予该片四颗星的满分评价，并在评论中写道：「它毫无顾忌、凌乱且充满能量，它打动了我们，电影部分的影响力来自其狂躁的能量...但电影做的（和表演）比我们原本想得更好。创造这种滑稽水准需要技巧，且片中充满对幽默角色的塑造并以感觉来演出，比他们必备的更引人入胜。」伊伯特还将《动物屋》放进了他的1978年十佳影片中，这是唯一一部获得该荣誉的《National Lampoon (magazine)》电影。《时代杂志》的法兰克·瑞奇（Frank Rich）在评论中表示：「它完美表达了60年代后期的恐惧和厌恶；《动物屋》在最差的情况下显得十分愚蠢，有趣的高点很容易弥补薄弱的低点。」该杂志还将《动物屋》纳为年度最佳电影。\n《华盛顿邮报》的盖瑞·阿诺（Gary Arnold）给了该片正面的评价，他在评论中写道：「贝鲁西还为了操弄观众而做出了一连串阴谋诡计的表情...他似乎能在静止时表现出无法抵抗的有趣，或神来一笔地投入于次要的闹剧机会。」《新闻周刊》的David Ansen认为：「但若《动物屋》缺乏《国家讽刺高中年鉴模仿》无味的启发，这仍是一个高等的低俗幽默。」《环球邮报》的罗伯特·马丁（Robert Martin）在评论中表示：「它是如此粗俗且乏味，你感觉你该感到恶心，但很难被如此有趣的东西所冒犯。」相反地，《Chicago Reader》的Dave Kehr给了该片负评，他表示：「虽然低俗喜剧无疑够劲，但电影的贪婪品味和琐碎卑劣相当落伍。」\n《动物屋》在美国精彩电视台排名的100部最有趣的电影中名列第一。该片于2004年被《纽约时报》选入「史上最佳1000部电影」行列，而《帝国杂志》则在「任何时刻500部最伟大的电影」中将其名列第279位。\n=== 票房 ===\n在首映周末，《动物屋》先在12间戏院中上映，票房收入27万美元，之后又将放映戏院增加至500间。该片在北美的总收入为1.201亿美元，并在全球收获1.41亿美元的票房佳绩。这在当时成为史上票房最高的喜剧片，直到被《魔鬼克星》（1984年，同由雷米斯编剧，瑞特曼执导）超越，成为1970年代票房收入第七高的电影（不含家庭媒体）。2000年代初，经通货膨胀调整后，《动物屋》是北美地区票房的第68高的电影。\n=== 奖项 ===\n2000年，美国电影学院（AFI）将《动物屋》列入百年百大喜剧电影名单中的第36位。然后于2005年，AFI将约翰·「布托」·布鲁塔斯基的名言「宽袍！宽袍！（Toga! Toga!）」列入百年百大电影台词名单中的第82位；而另外提名的名言还包括「结束？你说『结束』？我们说结束才能结束！德国轰炸珍珠港，结束了吗？才没有！（Over? Did you say 'over'? Nothing is over until we decide it is! Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!）」与「又肥、又醉加上笨，孩子，不能一辈子这样下去（Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, son）」。\n== 家庭媒体 ==\n《动物屋》于1979年发行影碟，并于1980、1983、1988和1990年推出VHS。1992年，该片随《福禄双霸天》（1980年）共同推出VHS组合包。1998年2月，该片首次以全萤幕显示的DVD格式发行，且于同年下旬发行了20周年宽萤幕珍藏版DVD、THX特别版VHS和宽萤幕签名收藏版雷射影碟，同时也发行了一部名为《年鉴－动物屋大团圆》（The Yearbook — An Animal House Reunion）的45分钟纪录片。该纪录片由J·M·肯尼（J.M. Kenny）制作，内容包括包括制作笔记、院线预告片，以及对导演兰迪斯、编剧雷米斯和米勒、作曲家伯恩斯坦、演员麦特森、艾伦、弗斯特、维侬、布鲁姆、麦吉尔、威道斯、瑞格特、麦特卡尔夫和贝肯等演员的新访谈。2000年，珍藏版DVD与《福禄双霸天》、《一九四一》（1979年）共同以约翰·贝鲁西三合一合辑的名义发行。在2003年发行的「双重秘密缓刑版（Double Secret Probation Edition）」DVD中，演员们在一支名为《他们现在在哪里：达泰校友更新》（Where Are They Now?: A Delta Alumni Update）的仿纪录片中重新诠释了各自的角色，并上演了这些角色在电影结局的后续发展；与电影版结局不同的是，贝鲁西的角色布托在成为参议员后进一步当上了美国总统。该DVD还包括幕后花絮《你知道吗？环球动画轶事》（Did You Know That? Universal Animated Anecdotes），当中收录了珍藏版纪录片的制作、MxPx演唱〈Shout〉的MV、院线预告片、制作笔记，以及演员和电影制作的传记。\n2006年8月，该片以HD DVD／DVD组合碟的形式发行，前者是1080p高画质格式，而后者则是标准画质。此外，《动物屋》和《斗犬》（2005年）是环球首批发行的HD DVD／DVD组合碟之一，但因高解析度光碟格式之战而使HD DVD停产，环球从2008年起决定改用蓝光光碟（BD）格式。《动物屋》于2011年7月26日推出BD。\n== 衍生作 ==\n《动物屋》的成功让环球电视公司推出了一部电视情景喜剧《Delta House》，1979年1月18日至4月21日在ABC播出。约翰·维侬回归饰演长期忍受达泰兄弟会恶整的维侬·沃梅主任，其他回归的演员还包括饰演秀逗的史蒂芬·弗斯特、饰演D日的布鲁斯·麦吉尔、饰演胡佛的威道斯。试播集由电影的编剧肯尼、米勒和雷米斯编写。该剧还增添了新演员——饰演重磅炸弹（The Bombshell，新角色）的蜜雪儿·菲佛和取代提姆·麦特森饰演奥图的彼得·福克斯（Peter Fox），而Josh Mostel则饰演转校生兼布托的弟弟吉姆·「布洛托」·布鲁塔斯基（Jim \"Blotto\" Blutarsky）；约翰·贝鲁西的弟弟吉姆原本被找来饰演布托一角，但被对方婉拒。《动物屋》还激发了另一部电视情景喜剧《Co-Ed Fever》的灵感，但未有电影的制片人和演员参与。该剧的故事背景设定于女子学校——巴克斯特大学（Baxter College）；但于1979年2月4日播出一集后就被取消。NBC还推出了以《动物屋》为灵感的情景喜剧《兄弟姐妹》，就和《达泰之家》一样在播出的三个月后宣布取消。\n该片的编剧曾计划推出一部1967年背景（即爱之夏）的电影续集，内容描述达泰的成员们为了斑马在旧金山Haight-Ashbury举行的婚礼而团聚；达泰中唯一成为嬉皮士的人是秀逗，他现在被称为双鱼（Pisces）。后来，克里斯·米勒和另一位《国家讽刺》的作家John Weidman为电影剧本写了一篇纲要，但环球因《More American Graffiti》（1979年，片中含有1967年嬉皮士的要素）的失利而将其拒绝。约翰·贝鲁西过世后，这个想法被无限期搁置。\n1982年，制片人马蒂·西蒙斯也参与了剧本的编写，试图再次制作续集；该剧本达127页，描述《动物屋》故事的五年后，一些达泰的成员们重返费博大学，并对他们深爱的兄弟会之变化而感到震惊。该项目于1982年5月6日完成剧本初稿后就未再有下文。\n2012年，环球影业舞台制作公司（Universal Pictures Stage Productions）宣布将推出《动物屋》的音乐剧版本，由裸体淑女乐队创作原创曲目，Theatre director兼东尼奖得主Casey Nicholaw执导，Michael Mitnick作词。2013年7月，David Yazbek取代了裸体淑女乐队来为该戏剧作曲。\n== 先驱及后世影响 ==\n虽然制作成本有限，但《动物屋》取得了极大的成功，且与《The Kentucky Fried Movie》（同由兰迪斯执导）共同成为定义恶烂电影的代表作，使其类型成为好莱坞的主流题材。在经过时间的推移后，《动物屋》由于受到广大粉丝推崇而已获得了邪典电影的地位。该片同时也激发了其他喜剧片的诞生，如《留校查看》（1981年）、《金牌警校军》系列、《美国派》系列（由《国家讽刺》的竞争对手《疯狂杂志》所制作）、《Old School (film)》（2003年）等。电影上映后，贝鲁西、麦特森、贝肯和艾伦的职业生涯逐步成长，瑞特曼、兰迪斯和雷米斯也成为了成功的电影人；兰迪斯使用有特色的演员和配乐来使喜剧变得更具说服力的作法则成为了电影在业界开始流行起来。电影上映后，贝鲁西、麦特森、贝肯和艾伦的职业生涯逐步成长，瑞特曼、兰迪斯和雷米斯也成为了成功的电影人；兰迪斯使用有特色的演员和配乐来使喜剧变得更具说服力的作法则成为了日后喜剧片制作的标竿。该片也促使艾伦和瑞格特在戏外成为长期的好友。\n在左派和反文化方面，该片提到了美国当年的政治时事动态，如副总统哈瑞·S·杜鲁门决定向广岛和长崎投下原子弹、总统理查德·尼克松、越南战争和民权运动。片中的反文化颠覆性幽默的前身是两部非「大学电影」，分别是1970年的讽刺黑色喜剧《风流军医俏护士》和《小银幕大电影》。\n2001年，该片被美国国会图书馆因其「重要文化、历史和美学价值」而与另外二十四部电影被保存于国家影片登记表中。2006年，米勒在《真实的动物屋：兄弟会启发电影的令人敬畏之堕落传奇》（The Real Animal House: The Awesomely Depraved Saga of the Fraternity That Inspired the Movie）一书中写下了关于他在阿尔法达泰更详尽的回忆录，他在当中表示，片中的恶作剧行径过于妨碍风化。\n《PopMatters》的詹姆斯·A·寇司比（James A. Cosby）指出，由于《动物屋》对大众的广泛影响，使得大学生试图在现实生活中效仿达泰之家的滑稽举止，导致「美国大学生每学期的GPA平均下降了0.18分」。\n== 备注 ==\n\n[要求] 翻译后的的长度必须等于8192个单词", "raw_data": "【动物屋】\n《动物屋》（National Lampoon's Animal House，或简称Animal House）是一部于1978年上映的美国Sex comedy电影，由约翰·兰迪斯执导，哈洛·雷米斯、Douglas Kenney和克里斯·米勒共同编写剧本，主演包括约翰·贝鲁西、提姆·麦特森、John Vernon、Verna Bloom、汤姆·哈斯及唐纳·苏德兰。故事描述一个时常制造麻烦的兄弟会被虚构学校费博大学（Faber College）的院长视为眼中钉，而其成员们则向院长的权威发起挑战。\n该片是由艾凡·瑞特曼和美国幽默杂志《National Lampoon (magazine)》的Matty Simmons所制作，主要受到编剧米勒曾发表于《国家讽刺》上的文章所启发。剧本中的设定和角色灵感取自米勒在达特茅斯学院的Alpha Delta Phi兄弟会及雷米斯在圣路易斯华盛顿大学担任Zeta Beta Tau兄弟会的经历。该片起初不受环球影业的青睐，而在编剧们的一番努力下才批准制作，但预算仅300万美元。《动物屋》是雷米斯的朋友兼《周六夜现场》成员贝鲁西早期的作品，贝鲁西也获得了导演兰迪斯的赏识；在吉维·蔡斯等影星拒绝演出后，兰迪斯选择了一群当时还未有名气的演员来演出，包括初入电影圈的凯文·贝肯和凯伦·艾伦。主要拍摄于1977年秋季开始在俄勒冈大学进行，为期三十二天。\n《动物屋》1978年7月28日美国上映，虽然起初在影评间的评价褒贬不一，但知名影评人罗杰·伊伯特和《时代杂志》都将其列为年度佳片，风评也在随著时间的推移而好转。该片仅以300万美元的预算在全球院线获得了超过1.41亿美元的票房，成为当时收入最高的喜剧电影。\n该片与同由兰迪斯执导的《The Kentucky Fried Movie》（1977年）共同成为定义恶烂电影的代表作，使其类型成为好莱坞的主流题材。2001年，《动物屋》被美国国会图书馆因其「重要文化、历史和美学价值」而被保存于国家影片登记表中。美国电影学院（AFI）则将该片列入百年百大喜剧电影名单中的第36位。除了被多间媒体视为影史最佳电影之一外，《动物屋》还在日后获得了邪典电影的地位。\n== 剧情 ==\n1962年，费博大学（Faber College）新生劳伦斯·「赖瑞」·克罗格和肯特·多夫曼寻求加入兄弟会。当他们发现自己在欧米茄兄弟会（Omega Theta Pi）的房子中感到格格不入后，改到隔壁的达泰兄弟会（Delta Tau Chi）参观；其中，肯特的哥哥是佛瑞德（Fred）曾是会员，所以没人能拒绝肯特的加入。达泰成员兼校园中恶作剧的头号惯犯约翰·「布托」·布鲁塔斯基欢迎他们，同时也认识了其他达泰成员，包括摩托车手丹尼·辛普森·「D日」·戴（Daniel Simpson \"D-Day\" Day）、分会主席、罗伯特·胡佛、艾克·「奥图」·史特拉顿和奥特的好友唐纳·「波恩」·索恩斯坦。其中，波恩的女友凯蒂不断向他施加压力，要求男友别在达泰喝酒，而是为自己的生活做点有意义的事。赖瑞和肯特对达泰宣誓忠诚，并被布托赋予兄弟会别名，分别是「斑马」及「秀逗」。\n大学院长维侬·沃梅希望将因各种校园行为违规和学术表现差劲、已处于缓刑中的达泰撤离学校，为此他动用一条隐藏的校规「双重秘密缓刑」，以赋予自己完全的权力来对付达泰。他任命端正、自傲的欧米茄会长格雷格协助自己。之后，各种事件加剧了院长和格雷格对达泰的敌意，包括Reserve Officers' Training Corps学员司令道格拉斯·C·奈德迈尔的马意外死于院长办公室，以及奥图与格雷格的女友曼蒂调情。\n布托和D日从垃圾箱中窃取了即将进行的考试卷答案，但因欧米茄已事先掉包过该考卷而使达泰全员的考试成绩不及格，平均得分为全校最低，以至于维侬告诉他们只需要再发生一次事故即可撤销达泰的租约。为了提升士气，达泰号召举办了一场Toga party，并邀请了Otis Day and the Knights在现场演唱。维侬的妻子玛丽昂也应邀参与并与奥图上床。斑马邀请与自己在超市遇见的收银员克洛蕾特，尽管两情相悦，但因女方喝醉而没有与她做爱。在斑马用购物车送她回家时，才发现克洛蕾特是市长的女儿。\nOtis Day and the Knights演唱〈Shama Lama Ding Dong〉的迪特湖俱乐部（Dexter Lake Club，摄于2012年）\n由于妻子的夜间外出和市长愤怒的威胁，使维侬举办了一场法庭听证会，但达泰成员们却因中途提早离席而使听证会被迫结束。奥图、波恩、秀逗与斑马在夜间开车外出游荡。奥图冒充成法兰克·莱蒙（Frank Lymon）从艾米莉·狄金森学院（Emily Dickinson College）那找法兰克的未婚妻，但却得知女方因一次爆炸意外而过世；他借此找了四名女学生和另外三人约会。他们停在奥提斯·戴与骑士表演的公路酒吧——迪特湖俱乐部（Dexter Lake Club），但没有意识到它是个只欢迎非洲裔美国客人的酒吧。奥图、波恩、秀逗与斑马被几名客人吓坏并匆匆开车离去，同时也毁了秀逗哥哥佛瑞德的车。\n隔天，格雷格从曼蒂好友贝丝口中得知，曼蒂和奥图有一腿，便生气地和其他欧米茄成员诱使奥图前往一家汽车旅馆，并借此将他殴打一顿。达泰之家的期中考成绩极差，以至于维侬借此将他们全员开除，并通知服役委员会，让他们获得服兵役的机会。这消息让秀逗大为震惊，以至于他忍不住朝维侬呕吐。\n达泰成员们感到相当沮丧，但布托说了些提升士气但缺乏逻辑的话（包含「德国轰炸珍珠港，结束了吗？才没有！」）后，他们决定向维侬、欧米茄和大学报复。D日将佛瑞德的车改装成装甲车，并用一个蛋糕样式的外壳包覆，潜入一年一度的返校游行活动中。他们的行径对游行造成重大的破坏，格雷格和维侬都被狠狠地恶整一顿；事成之后，达泰成员们各自离去。在过程中，还以定格画面加字卡的方式描述了达泰成员们的未来，他们都成为受人尊敬的专业人士（其中，布托和曼蒂结了婚并成为参议员）；而欧米茄等人的下场则非常不幸，如格雷格在监狱被强暴、奈德迈尔在越战被自己人枪杀。\n== 演员 ==\n* 约翰·贝鲁西饰演约翰·「布托」·布鲁塔斯基（John \"Bluto\" Blutarsky）\n* 提姆·麦特森饰演艾克·「奥图」·史特拉顿（Eric \"Otter\" Stratton）\n* Peter Riegert饰演唐纳·「波恩」·索恩斯坦（Donald \"Boon\" Schoenstein）\n* 汤姆·哈斯饰演劳伦斯·「赖瑞」·克罗格／斑马（Lawrence \"Larry\" Kroger / Pinto）\n* Stephen Furst饰演肯特·「秀逗」·多夫曼（Kent \"Flounder\" Dorfman）\n* 布鲁斯·麦吉尔饰演丹尼·辛普森·「D日」·戴（Daniel Simpson \"D-Day\" Day）\n* James Widdoes饰演罗伯特·胡佛（Robert Hoover）\n* Douglas Kenney饰演「史托克」（\"Stork\"）\n* James Daughton饰演葛雷哥里·「格雷格」·马马拉德（Gregory \"Greg\" Marmalard）\n* Mark Metcalf饰演道格拉斯·C·奈德迈尔（Douglas C.

Schooling在看完剧本后撤回了拍片许可。\n俄勒冈州尤金的俄勒冈大学校长William Beaty Boyd曾于1966年在加利福尼亚大学柏克莱分校担任高阶行政人员，当时他的校园被选为电影《毕业生》（1967年）的取景地。在博伊德咨询了其他高阶行政同事之后，由于缺乏艺术价值而建议他将其拒绝，而使《毕业生》中柏克莱大学的校园场景是在南加州大学拍摄。《毕业生》之后成为了经典，当制片人询问是某能在俄勒冈大学中拍摄时，博伊德决心不犯两次相同的错误。与学生会领袖和Pan Hellenic Council兄弟会的干事协商后，大学关系总监（Director of University Relations）告诉校长，该剧本虽然不修边幅且多半庸俗，但却是对大学生活的趣味恶搞。博伊德甚至允许将自己的办公室当作沃梅主任的办公室场景。\n被选为当作达泰之家的房屋原是位于尤金的Dr. A.W. Patterson House。1959年左右，它被Phi Sigma Kappa兄弟会的Psi Deuteron分会收购，并一直作为他们的分会场，直到1967年，由于该分会的会员人数少而关闭了该分会。房子被拍卖后，处于闲置且失修的状态，如宽敞的门廊被拆除、草地铺满碎石。此外，当在此拍摄电影时，Phi Kappa Psi和Sigma Nu兄弟会的房子位于东第11大道700街区的Phi Sigma Kappa的旧房子旁边。Phi Sigma Kappa房屋和Sigma Nu房屋的内部用于许多室内场景，但每个房间都是在录音棚中拍摄。Patterson的房子在1977年拍摄结束后仍处于闲置状态，并于1986年被拆除。现址（scale:5000）现由西北基督大学的教育与咨询学校占用。停车场入口西侧的一块巨石上摆放著一块青铜色的牌匾，以纪念达泰之家的位置。凯萨琳·威尔森（Katherine Wilson）是《动物屋》的场地勘查员，她于2018年受访时表示，Sigma Nu地下室正是片中Toga party的拍摄地；如今，西北基督大学将其地下室上锁。返校游行场景是在科蒂奇格罗夫市中心约20英里（30公里）、连接著通过尤金的南5号州际公路俄勒冈州段的大街上拍摄。\n=== 拍摄 ===\n主要拍摄于1977年秋季开始进行，且兰迪斯要求饰演达泰的演员们提早五天到场，以彼此培养感情。他们住在附近位于斯普林菲尔德的Rodeway Inn汽车旅馆，还将一架旧钢琴从大厅搬到了布鲁斯·麦吉尔的房间，这是他们在一起交流的「派对中心」。James Widdoes回忆说：「就像大一新生一样。彼此之间有了很多认识，且以我们的角色名称互相称呼。」这种策略也鼓励饰演达泰的演员与饰演欧米茄的演员分开，从而在镜头上产生真实的敌意感。在拍摄期间，贝鲁西和他的妻子茱蒂（Judy）在尤金南部租了一间房子，好让他远离酒精和毒品；当贝鲁西通勤前往纽约市进行《周六夜现场》演出时，她仍留在俄勒冈州。\n演员们被警告别与大学生混在一起；某晚，一些女孩还是邀请了其中几个演员参加兄弟会派对，演员们答应邀请，但却在派对上受到公开的敌意。这群人明显不受到欢迎，正当他们离开时，威道斯朝一群喝醉的Oregon Ducks football队员扔了杯啤酒，使一场宛如「电影场面」般的斗争一触即发。提姆·麦特森、麦吉尔、彼得·瑞格特和威道斯险些逃脱；麦吉尔在过程中留下了青肿的眼眶，威道斯则掉了几颗牙齿。隔日从纽约抵达此处的贝鲁西曾说要向该兄弟会报复，但众人被阻劝。\n除了贝鲁西挑起开打的大吼外，片中自助餐厅的食物大战是一次性拍摄，演员们被鼓励真实上演。此外，贝鲁西在自助餐厅中即兴创作了许多桥段，如将一堆食物堆放在托盘上，这获得了兰迪斯的赏识。秀逗（Flounder，Stephen Furst饰演）在超市里接东西的场景则是另一回事；弗斯特巧妙地兰迪斯和麦特森扔给他的许多物品，使导演惊叹不已。兰迪斯在一天内将费时的法庭戏完成，让他在与艾凡·瑞特曼的赌注中胜出。\n在尤金拍摄的三十二天大多集中于11月完成。由于电影的预算太少，同一台摄影机平均每天得重复使用三十五次；此外，兰迪斯没有自己的拖车或办公室，且连续三周无法观看Dailies。他的妻子黛博拉·纳杜尔曼在当地的二手店购买了大多数服装，她和贝鲁西的妻子茱蒂还布置了宽袍派对的场景。片中虽然有大量饮酒的桥段，但麦特森表示那些都是低醇啤酒和茶notetag|片中的一个知名场景是贝鲁西一口气喝完一瓶杰克丹尼，但瓶内实际装的是冰茶而非真正的酒。，且兰迪斯严格禁止演员们在拍片期间吸毒、饮酒。此外，兰迪斯与麦吉尔为了造访片场的记者们演了一出戏，导演假装因演员在演戏时遇上困难而动怒。兰迪斯还将一个龟裂的罐子砸在麦吉尔的头上。他跌倒在地，假装失去知觉。记者们完全上了当；当他要麦吉尔起来时，对方则赖著不动。\n迪特湖俱乐部（摄于2011年）\n由于尤金附近太荒凉，黑人临时演员们不得不从波特兰搭公车前往迪特湖俱乐部（Dexter Lake Club，-122.8115）。更严重的是，俱乐部一段的剧情惊动了环球高管内德·塔南和其他片商的主管，他认为这段涉及种族主义并提出警告：「如果你将这段留在片中，在美国的黑人会离席并走出戏院。」但该片段在知名黑人演员李察·普瑞尔的批准下得以保留在片中。\n《动物屋》的原剪辑时长达175分钟，而删除时长超过一个小时；删除的场景包括：\n* 约翰·兰迪斯在片中客串了一名自助餐厅洗碗工，他试图阻止布托吃掉所有食物，两人为此引起了争执。\n* 布恩和胡佛告诉斑马，达泰过去传奇成员们的故事。\n* 奥图与几个女友在一起的两个片段（其中一人为电影场勘凯萨琳·威尔森饰演）。\n* 布托将芥末倒在自己身上并开始演唱〈我是芥末人〉（I am the Mustard Man）一片段的加长版。\n== 音乐 ==\n《动物屋》的配乐由作曲家埃尔默·伯恩斯坦所创作，他在配乐中结合了摇滚和节奏布鲁斯；他在约翰·兰迪斯还小时就是兰迪斯家庭的朋友。兰迪斯很认真地要他来为该片作曲，伯恩斯坦很容易地被说服，但被片商质疑他是否适合粗俗喜剧；兰迪斯让伯恩斯坦表达出对喜剧的重视来使片商放心。伯恩斯坦将约翰内斯·勃拉姆斯的《Academic Festival Overture》改编成〈费博大学主题曲〉，并表示，该片为他的作曲生涯打开了一扇通往喜剧的门。\n该原声带于1978年以黑胶唱片发行，后于1998年发行CD。在2000年代后期，由于〈费博大学主题曲〉（Faber College Theme）与波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那国歌的相似之处而引起大众的关注。\n曲目列表\n片中的其他音乐还包括〈Theme from A Summer Place〉（马克斯·史坦纳作曲，Percy Faith和他的乐队演奏）、〈Who's Sorry Now?〉（Ted Snyder、Bert Kalmar和Harry Ruby作曲，Connie Francis演唱）和〈The Washington Post (march)〉（约翰·菲利普·苏沙作曲）和〈Tammy〉（Jay Livingston和Ray Evans作曲）。\n== 发行 ==\n《动物屋》由环球影业定于1978年7月28日美国上映。当瑞特曼向美国各个地区的主管和销售经理展示了在两天内剪成的10分钟电影制作片段后，加剧了片商对该片的热情。片商将二十份副本分发给了参与的厂商并获得正面的反响。《动物屋》在正式上映的四个月前于丹佛先行试映；在获得观众的喜爱后，制片人意识到该片将会成功。《动物屋》上映时，兰迪斯、威道斯和凯伦·艾伦在全美进行巡回宣传活动。环球影业花费了约450万美元在选定的大学校园宣传该片，促进学生号召自己的宽袍派对。马里兰大学学院市分校举办的宽袍派对吸引了大约2000人参加，而威斯康星大学麦迪逊分校则吸引了1万人，创下了《金氏世界纪录》。由于该片的影响，该派对在1978年和1979年期间成为大学校园中颇受欢迎的活动。\n== 反响 ==\n=== 评价 ===\n上映期间，《动物屋》在影评界获得的评价褒贬不一，但其魅力很快地被发觉，此后它被公认为1978年年度佳片之一。该片在汇总媒体网站烂番茄上根据50篇评论而持有90%的新鲜度，平均得分7.68／10；该网站共识：「导演约翰·兰迪斯的才华和《周六夜现场》不受控的约翰·贝鲁西共谋创造了一个暴躁、持续引起共鸣的颠覆性大学喜剧。」而在Metacritic上根据13篇评论则获得了79分，代表著「普遍正面的评价」。\n《芝加哥太阳报》的罗杰·伊伯特给予该片四颗星的满分评价，并在评论中写道：「它毫无顾忌、凌乱且充满能量，它打动了我们，电影部分的影响力来自其狂躁的能量...但电影做的（和表演）比我们原本想得更好。创造这种滑稽水准需要技巧，且片中充满对幽默角色的塑造并以感觉来演出，比他们必备的更引人入胜。」伊伯特还将《动物屋》放进了他的1978年十佳影片中，这是唯一一部获得该荣誉的《National Lampoon (magazine)》电影。《时代杂志》的法兰克·瑞奇（Frank Rich）在评论中表示：「它完美表达了60年代后期的恐惧和厌恶；《动物屋》在最差的情况下显得十分愚蠢，有趣的高点很容易弥补薄弱的低点。」该杂志还将《动物屋》纳为年度最佳电影。\n《华盛顿邮报》的盖瑞·阿诺（Gary Arnold）给了该片正面的评价，他在评论中写道：「贝鲁西还为了操弄观众而做出了一连串阴谋诡计的表情...他似乎能在静止时表现出无法抵抗的有趣，或神来一笔地投入于次要的闹剧机会。」《新闻周刊》的David Ansen认为：「但若《动物屋》缺乏《国家讽刺高中年鉴模仿》无味的启发，这仍是一个高等的低俗幽默。」《环球邮报》的罗伯特·马丁（Robert Martin）在评论中表示：「它是如此粗俗且乏味，你感觉你该感到恶心，但很难被如此有趣的东西所冒犯。」相反地，《Chicago Reader》的Dave Kehr给了该片负评，他表示：「虽然低俗喜剧无疑够劲，但电影的贪婪品味和琐碎卑劣相当落伍。」\n《动物屋》在美国精彩电视台排名的100部最有趣的电影中名列第一。该片于2004年被《纽约时报》选入「史上最佳1000部电影」行列，而《帝国杂志》则在「任何时刻500部最伟大的电影」中将其名列第279位。\n=== 票房 ===\n在首映周末，《动物屋》先在12间戏院中上映，票房收入27万美元，之后又将放映戏院增加至500间。该片在北美的总收入为1.201亿美元，并在全球收获1.41亿美元的票房佳绩。这在当时成为史上票房最高的喜剧片，直到被《魔鬼克星》（1984年，同由雷米斯编剧，瑞特曼执导）超越，成为1970年代票房收入第七高的电影（不含家庭媒体）。2000年代初，经通货膨胀调整后，《动物屋》是北美地区票房的第68高的电影。\n=== 奖项 ===\n2000年，美国电影学院（AFI）将《动物屋》列入百年百大喜剧电影名单中的第36位。然后于2005年，AFI将约翰·「布托」·布鲁塔斯基的名言「宽袍！宽袍！（Toga! Toga!）」列入百年百大电影台词名单中的第82位；而另外提名的名言还包括「结束？你说『结束』？我们说结束才能结束！德国轰炸珍珠港，结束了吗？才没有！（Over? Did you say 'over'? Nothing is over until we decide it is! Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!）」与「又肥、又醉加上笨，孩子，不能一辈子这样下去（Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, son）」。\n== 家庭媒体 ==\n《动物屋》于1979年发行影碟，并于1980、1983、1988和1990年推出VHS。1992年，该片随《福禄双霸天》（1980年）共同推出VHS组合包。1998年2月，该片首次以全萤幕显示的DVD格式发行，且于同年下旬发行了20周年宽萤幕珍藏版DVD、THX特别版VHS和宽萤幕签名收藏版雷射影碟，同时也发行了一部名为《年鉴－动物屋大团圆》（The Yearbook — An Animal House Reunion）的45分钟纪录片。该纪录片由J·M·肯尼（J.M. Kenny）制作，内容包括包括制作笔记、院线预告片，以及对导演兰迪斯、编剧雷米斯和米勒、作曲家伯恩斯坦、演员麦特森、艾伦、弗斯特、维侬、布鲁姆、麦吉尔、威道斯、瑞格特、麦特卡尔夫和贝肯等演员的新访谈。2000年，珍藏版DVD与《福禄双霸天》、《一九四一》（1979年）共同以约翰·贝鲁西三合一合辑的名义发行。在2003年发行的「双重秘密缓刑版（Double Secret Probation Edition）」DVD中，演员们在一支名为《他们现在在哪里：达泰校友更新》（Where Are They Now?: A Delta Alumni Update）的仿纪录片中重新诠释了各自的角色，并上演了这些角色在电影结局的后续发展；与电影版结局不同的是，贝鲁西的角色布托在成为参议员后进一步当上了美国总统。该DVD还包括幕后花絮《你知道吗？环球动画轶事》（Did You Know That? Universal Animated Anecdotes），当中收录了珍藏版纪录片的制作、MxPx演唱〈Shout〉的MV、院线预告片、制作笔记，以及演员和电影制作的传记。\n2006年8月，该片以HD DVD／DVD组合碟的形式发行，前者是1080p高画质格式，而后者则是标准画质。此外，《动物屋》和《斗犬》（2005年）是环球首批发行的HD DVD／DVD组合碟之一，但因高解析度光碟格式之战而使HD DVD停产，环球从2008年起决定改用蓝光光碟（BD）格式。《动物屋》于2011年7月26日推出BD。\n== 衍生作 ==\n《动物屋》的成功让环球电视公司推出了一部电视情景喜剧《Delta House》，1979年1月18日至4月21日在ABC播出。约翰·维侬回归饰演长期忍受达泰兄弟会恶整的维侬·沃梅主任，其他回归的演员还包括饰演秀逗的史蒂芬·弗斯特、饰演D日的布鲁斯·麦吉尔、饰演胡佛的威道斯。试播集由电影的编剧肯尼、米勒和雷米斯编写。该剧还增添了新演员——饰演重磅炸弹（The Bombshell，新角色）的蜜雪儿·菲佛和取代提姆·麦特森饰演奥图的彼得·福克斯（Peter Fox），而Josh Mostel则饰演转校生兼布托的弟弟吉姆·「布洛托」·布鲁塔斯基（Jim \"Blotto\" Blutarsky）；约翰·贝鲁西的弟弟吉姆原本被找来饰演布托一角，但被对方婉拒。《动物屋》还激发了另一部电视情景喜剧《Co-Ed Fever》的灵感，但未有电影的制片人和演员参与。该剧的故事背景设定于女子学校——巴克斯特大学（Baxter College）；但于1979年2月4日播出一集后就被取消。NBC还推出了以《动物屋》为灵感的情景喜剧《兄弟姐妹》，就和《达泰之家》一样在播出的三个月后宣布取消。\n该片的编剧曾计划推出一部1967年背景（即爱之夏）的电影续集，内容描述达泰的成员们为了斑马在旧金山Haight-Ashbury举行的婚礼而团聚；达泰中唯一成为嬉皮士的人是秀逗，他现在被称为双鱼（Pisces）。后来，克里斯·米勒和另一位《国家讽刺》的作家John Weidman为电影剧本写了一篇纲要，但环球因《More American Graffiti》（1979年，片中含有1967年嬉皮士的要素）的失利而将其拒绝。约翰·贝鲁西过世后，这个想法被无限期搁置。\n1982年，制片人马蒂·西蒙斯也参与了剧本的编写，试图再次制作续集；该剧本达127页，描述《动物屋》故事的五年后，一些达泰的成员们重返费博大学，并对他们深爱的兄弟会之变化而感到震惊。该项目于1982年5月6日完成剧本初稿后就未再有下文。\n2012年，环球影业舞台制作公司（Universal Pictures Stage Productions）宣布将推出《动物屋》的音乐剧版本，由裸体淑女乐队创作原创曲目，Theatre director兼东尼奖得主Casey Nicholaw执导，Michael Mitnick作词。2013年7月，David Yazbek取代了裸体淑女乐队来为该戏剧作曲。\n== 先驱及后世影响 ==\n虽然制作成本有限，但《动物屋》取得了极大的成功，且与《The Kentucky Fried Movie》（同由兰迪斯执导）共同成为定义恶烂电影的代表作，使其类型成为好莱坞的主流题材。在经过时间的推移后，《动物屋》由于受到广大粉丝推崇而已获得了邪典电影的地位。该片同时也激发了其他喜剧片的诞生，如《留校查看》（1981年）、《金牌警校军》系列、《美国派》系列（由《国家讽刺》的竞争对手《疯狂杂志》所制作）、《Old School (film)》（2003年）等。电影上映后，贝鲁西、麦特森、贝肯和艾伦的职业生涯逐步成长，瑞特曼、兰迪斯和雷米斯也成为了成功的电影人；兰迪斯使用有特色的演员和配乐来使喜剧变得更具说服力的作法则成为了电影在业界开始流行起来。电影上映后，贝鲁西、麦特森、贝肯和艾伦的职业生涯逐步成长，瑞特曼、兰迪斯和雷米斯也成为了成功的电影人；兰迪斯使用有特色的演员和配乐来使喜剧变得更具说服力的作法则成为了日后喜剧片制作的标竿。该片也促使艾伦和瑞格特在戏外成为长期的好友。\n在左派和反文化方面，该片提到了美国当年的政治时事动态，如副总统哈瑞·S·杜鲁门决定向广岛和长崎投下原子弹、总统理查德·尼克松、越南战争和民权运动。片中的反文化颠覆性幽默的前身是两部非「大学电影」，分别是1970年的讽刺黑色喜剧《风流军医俏护士》和《小银幕大电影》。\n2001年，该片被美国国会图书馆因其「重要文化、历史和美学价值」而与另外二十四部电影被保存于国家影片登记表中。2006年，米勒在《真实的动物屋：兄弟会启发电影的令人敬畏之堕落传奇》（The Real Animal House: The Awesomely Depraved Saga of the Fraternity That Inspired the Movie）一书中写下了关于他在阿尔法达泰更详尽的回忆录，他在当中表示，片中的恶作剧行径过于妨碍风化。\n《PopMatters》的詹姆斯·A·寇司比（James A.

you two guys ? okay . go ahead . industrial designer : yes . user interface : . marketing : . user interface : coffee . marketing : industrial designer : 'kay , we 've made a prototype . um , we 've got uh uh our aspects from the last meeting . uh , especially we looked at the form , material and the colour . um , we 've uh drawn here the p prototype . the logo is uh is uh is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control , user interface : industrial designer : but it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher . um , our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing . maybe you can uh point them uh the functions . user interface : uh , well the uh all the functions are discussed uh i think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . uh , it 's a little bit . uh , power button . uh then the the the nine uh channels . project manager : user interface : uh the volume uh uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . and then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext project manager : oh no , the the the mute button misses now . user interface : i thought that was th marketing : alright , i project manager : do y do you user interface : oh , the mute button . project manager : did we want to have a m mute button ? industrial designer : but uh that marketing : yeah . industrial designer : it 's uh here then , in the middle . user interface : yeah . marketing : alright , and uh you got ta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button . industrial designer : yes , um user interface : well , yeah mo uh mo industrial designer : we 've disc user interface : yeah , well most of them are right-handed . industrial designer : most of the users marketing : yeah , but you you got ta make it clear on the on user interface : yeah well , i do n't have time in uh anymore on the industrial designer : yes , y there there will be a p a little a little p_ on that and a little uh yeah . marketing : yeah , and a and a triangle on that . user interface : oh yeah , just progr programme above , i think . marketing : yes . next to that i kinda miss a zero actually . user interface : project manager : wait , there 's was one thing i wanted to ask . marketing : industrial designer : user interface : marketing : industrial designer : project manager : uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like marketing : project manager : uh d i call it teens and twenties . uh , y th th th the two numbers . marketing : all n no , that 's um kinda dependent on the television . user interface : yeah , true , yeah . industrial designer : it 's a television . yes . project manager : yeah , but do we have do we need extra buttons , user interface : uh project manager : for example some uh some have to user interface : uh i think so . marketing : i think industrial designer : yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , uh th with the one and a double uh uh marketing : yeah , i think you should add user interface : zero ? marketing : a cross , or whatever . yeah , line . project manager : yeah , but you do n't you do n't actually need them , user interface : may maybe here ? project manager : becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds user interface : yeah . and then a second . marketing : no , that 's dependent on the television . project manager : no , i do n't think so . industrial designer : yes , you have televisions , then you have to , you know , you have to uh press marketing : i do know so . user interface : is it depending on television ? project manager : nah , i do n't think so really , marketing : yeah . project manager : because you have a i know some remote controls that do n't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten . industrial designer : yes , but but a lot uh marketing : yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television . or actually , the other way around . project manager : no , i think uh i really think it 's n marketing : but project manager : because you can when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it 's the same thing as when you just push the one , marketing : yeah . project manager : because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply . industrial designer : yes , but marketing : yeah , well but su if industrial designer : some televisions do n't accept uh that that project manager : yeah , because that 's i it 's for television . it 's exact the same thing . industrial designer : no , no , but s marketing : no no no . so some television respond differently . look , if uh i i project manager : no , listen listen . when you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . i in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . marketing : yes . yes , that 's true . project manager : the one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you do n't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . user interface : yeah . true . marketing : no project manager : i think it works that way , really . marketing : no , it it it works uh if you have n't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space . project manager : yeah , but it 's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button . industrial designer : yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons . project manager : yeah , but you do n't underst uh you do n't understand my point . marketing : yep . true . project manager : i think it 's exact the same thing when y industrial designer : you want yes , but some television do n't support it . project manager : no , but then they would a would also support that button , because it 's the same thing . user interface : but the ex project manager : listen , with that that 's that special but button you 're talking about , eh ? that 's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv tv that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . when you do n't have that separate button , and you push y one , it 's exactly the same thing . do y you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had marketing : no , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c industrial designer : a remote can project manager : yeah . but you give the input . industrial designer : so they need no , they need project manager : you push the one . that 's the same thing as the button with the one and it marketing : no , that 's not true . project manager : yes it it is . marketing : it 's simply not true . it 's simply not true . project manager : think about it . user interface : yeah . you uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something industrial designer : but uh marketing : uh project manager : and it 's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one . marketing : no , remote control does n't give signal after five seconds . remote control is a stupid thing . if you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television . project manager : yeah , that 's true . yeah , but i m uh but it 's i i know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that does n't sport these buttons , it still works . industrial designer : yeah , it project manager : but okay , we we 'll impl marketing : no , definitely not . definitely not . user interface : we 'll discuss them in the usability lab . project manager : no , we 'll apply them then for now . user interface : uh eva evaluation . marketing : user interface : i do n't know uh i do n't know if if it 's it 's necessary . project manager : yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . user interface : yeah ? project manager : yeah , i think so . yeah , for now , if we do n't know for sure whether user interface : okay . industrial designer : and the button for the scart uh audio video uh external input . project manager : yeah but marketing : uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , i guess . project manager : okay . what i said about uh the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : but i still think i it it all tvs in some ways support it , i do n't know . i think it 's more c is m maybe we do n't uh we both do n't really understand how it i how it really works , industrial designer : no , no . project manager : but i think there 's more to in than wha than what you just said . industrial designer : uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press . project manager : i do think that uh m tvs support mur multiple kind of remote controls . m industrial designer : uh , some n some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten project manager : th wo n't work wi with uh industrial designer : no , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . project manager : to have that special button . industrial designer : when you uh press one button , you give one signal . and the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher . but project manager : okay , well we 'll see . industrial designer : when you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals , it could work , but just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote . marketing : okay . i kinda miss the docking station . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yes . it 's here on the user interface : marketing : user interface : well it industrial designer : user interface : yeah , uh there 's nothing i think it 's pretty basic , industrial designer : we came uh user interface : the the there 's no fu there 's one there 's one button , marketing : no nothing really trendy about it . user interface : that 's wha there 's there 's there 's one function and that 's n the one button when you want to find it . industrial designer : but maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , marketing : the button . industrial designer : because real real reaction sells more products than only remote controls . so maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh m_p_ three players or or uh uh hearing devices . marketing : i think that 's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices . industrial designer : yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it 's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh marketing : yeah , of course . mm-hmm . well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape , of course . industrial designer : yes , but we can make marketing : the technology and the voltage can be the same . that 's uh that 's true . but uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit . industrial designer : no , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same . marketing : yeah , that 's true , but uh industrial designer : when when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . just have to be big enough for the biggest marketing : yes , but uh i i g should n't it fall then ? it is n't going to fall down ? that 's a bit uh industrial designer : no , when you make it large enough no it it will not . marketing : yeah , i think industrial designer : but then it 's a little bit marketing : no , but if if like this , i 'll i 'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this , industrial designer : but it 's just an idea . marketing : i wo n't draw it really . if you got a base which is uh as big as this industrial designer : but it 's flat it 's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this . user interface : you can . but i i i it 's backwards . marketing : yeah sure , but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can industrial designer : yes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big user interface : but it 's it 's backwards . it 's leaning . it 's leaning backwards , i think , in the in the docking station . marketing : yeah . uh , wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom user interface : that 's text . marketing : oh , right , help . project manager : but user interface : marketing : uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh in in the industrial designer : yes , little holer littler uh , little products go deeper in it . marketing : yeah . that i that is possible , yep . project manager : well let 's ha let 's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues still to come . marketing : yeah , sure , you 're right . industrial designer : yes . and uh uh project manager : but we have to look n i do n't know . industrial designer : the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . marketing : i do n't like the colours . mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button , which is the most common used uh function , and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so it 's it 's it 's really good design . marketing : yeah . alright . project manager : yes . that 's it ? industrial designer : yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it . marketing : the light . okay . and other lights ? project manager : i think added lights are gon na be a problem too . industrial designer : yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it . marketing : no , o on the on the front . yeah , okay . maybe the uh the logo . user interface : lights ? industrial designer : but , it will also uh uh use batteries , marketing : yeah , why not ? industrial designer : and do we want to marketing : of course . project manager : okay . for now , uh this is uh is good enough . yeah , what was uh on the marketing : okay . industrial designer : the all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh project manager : okay , but in the oh yeah , the colour , because we 're gon na use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , is n't it ? then we 're gon na do the buttons in the i are we 're gon na have rubber buttons . and they 're be a they 'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . user interface : yeah . marketing : uh , in the same colour as the side . user interface : yeah . yeah . yeah . marketing : yeah , i think i think that 'll be good . project manager : okay . and i think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic , and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff industrial designer : yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights , so it will uh project manager : yeah , we 'll talk about the lights later . 'cause i also don yeah , it 's depends on the costs and such . but uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours , marketing : yeah . project manager : but may i dunno if that 's important , but we 'll talk about that later . okay , for now this is this is okay . marketing : we will . project manager : um , the next p y you gon na give a presentation too ? uh , i have to see the agenda . marketing : well , uh yeah , i i 'm gon na do something right there , yeah . user interface : project manager : detail design . marketing : we got ta do that on the right the most right-most screen , because the leftmost project manager : evaluation criteria . marketing : yep , that 's me . project manager : okay . user interface : okay . marketing : alright . i will be needing that image , so leave it please . um go away . right , we 're gon na evaluate that design according to a few points . um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together . project manager : marketing : i wan na have a colour over here , come on . right , the remote is not ugly , a bit weird sentence , but the positive things has to be on the left , so i said not ugly instead of ugly . user interface : marketing : uh , what would you say , we we got ta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . user interface : project manager : okay . industrial designer : marketing : the remote control is not ugly . how do you feel ? project manager : yeah , i think four maybe would be appropriate , because it 's yeah , maybe it really depends on taste . uh , i mean it 's kind of , our design . it 's so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : background colour . project manager : i do n't know or uh i do n't know how you casting . yeah . industrial designer : i think i think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own marketing : how do you guys feel ? the different designs . industrial designer : yes , you can make it in your own uh user interface : yeah . industrial designer : more to your own personality or or house style . marketing : okay . project manager : yeah , but we d we did n't we 're we 're not planning to use fronts , i believe . marketing : no , not not fronts , but different designs . project manager : with a colour a co a colours . oh , okay . user interface : no , not fronts . different designs . different colours maybe , yeah . marketing : and that 's still uh uh , yeah , is is uh is a little personal touch , i guess . project manager : okay , but oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our marketing : what ? yeah , wha wha what would you uh guys uh think ? personally . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : or forty . user interface : we can make it a one . marketing : personally . yes , but what is it ? industrial designer : i think two or three . user interface : mm yeah . marketing : guido ? user interface : i agree . marketing : two or three . user interface : um , i uh i go for the positive . so i go for two . marketing : i was i was thinking about three , so i guess project manager : uh , i was thinking about four , so i think three is uh user interface : okay , three . marketing : three is uh a bit uh oh , what am i doing ? i 'll mark it . the remote control 's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah well , let that let 's make that a one . user interface : two . one . one . marketing : yeah ? antek , you agree ? user interface : okay yeah , i 'll i 'll agree . project manager : that 's one thing for sure . marketing : yeah . you 're not antek . user interface : i 'm the i 'm the usability , so marketing : i totally agree . the remote control the remote control 's relevant buttons are prominently visible . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , two or a one , i guess . user interface : the project manager : it 's something we really put work into . marketing : yeah , i yeah . industrial designer : it 's all about the buttons . marketing : i would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . and our oh yeah , it 's a b yeah . yeah ? alright . that 's a one ? you agree ? project manager : yeah . marketing : the remote control has n't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . i think we totally succeeded there . project manager : but user interface : well project manager : well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . marketing : oh user interface : yeah , well menu yeah , maybe . marketing : yeah , that 's true . that 's true . project manager : and telete industrial designer : also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits , project manager : yeah , we do n't know if the uh they 're necessary . industrial designer : o they 're used uh uh marketing : the the yeah , m well , you d you 've got a point . project manager : i think a two . user interface : yeah , true . yeah , i agree . industrial designer : can yes , three , two . project manager : came a long way , but not we did n't not uh marketing : two or three ? user interface : mm two . industrial designer : but you ca n't make a remote control without them , marketing : two ? antek . user interface : because we got industrial designer : because marketing : nay that that that 's true , that 's true . they 're definitely needed . project manager : no , w w it can also always be more simplistic , but two is marketing : so we put it on a two ? project manager : yeah . marketing : the remote control has got a really trendy look . user interface : industrial designer : yes . a one . project manager : yeah , uh a t i think a two . marketing : maarten . user interface : well . industrial designer : project manager : yeah yeah , y i it 's hard to say from this picture . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we we 've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever . user interface : yeah . marketing : ever , yeah . industrial designer : marketing : guido . project manager : but i do think it 's more user interface : uh , i will i will make it a three , because uh yeah . i i th project manager : but i do think that it 's more trendy than beautiful . marketing : yeah , uh i agree . i agree . project manager : so so i think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the user interface : yeah . true , yeah . marketing : i was planning to give it a two , uh where i give the not ugly uh project manager : a th a three . marketing : oh , yeah , that 's true . you agree on the two ? user interface : yeah . project manager : i i uh when you compare to the marketing : great . remote control has n't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . project manager : uh uh what 's the difference with user interface : marketing : uh , i copied that one . well , uh forget that . project manager : okay . marketing : um go away . remote control has got innovative technology implanted . user interface : no . we 're not well , maybe the the the on the side . industrial designer : no , not lcd , so . project manager : yeah , but we uh you mean the rubber stuff ? marketing : yeah , and the light . project manager : yeah , but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh . user interface : and the light maybe . industrial designer : but that that 's not innovative . user interface : but project manager : and i do n't u also it 's also really not innovative , industrial designer : lights lights are marketing : well , i g project manager : it 's more marketing : it 's not seven ? project manager : no , six . or seven maybe , yeah . user interface : well , six . no , six . project manager : or six . marketing : why uh why not a seven ? project manager : yeah , mine is seven . industrial designer : because we 've tried to make it a little bit innovative , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but it but it project manager : uh it 's uh depends on the on the maybe industrial designer : with the lights it it 's it 's kind of future user interface : project manager : no , i think i think actually it 's a seven maybe , but there 's nothing innovative about it . marketing : yeah , you think the lights are innovative ? well , it 's n true . uh , i agree , industrial designer : but still you can retrieve it when it 's when it 's gone , with the with marketing : m but user interface : innovative in generally or just f original for marketing : i 'll yeah , you you did n't draw the docking station . industrial designer : yes . the docking station is a is a little bit innovative . project manager : n no no , marketing : yeah , it it 's i think i think with its project manager : t . user interface : a docking station is innova project manager : yeah , i mean the dock station , but but uh , i think the the docking station , it 's gon na be a kind of a problem . user interface : industrial designer : it 's a part of the remote . marketing : i think more m user interface : okay . industrial designer : and with the speaker on the there 's also a speaker . project manager : but marketing : uh that that 's n project manager : well , let 's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . well i i yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : no uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so i think we project manager : okay , for now it 's a six or a seven uh , sev marketing : it 's it 's a six . project manager : six maybe , because industrial designer : but the retrieval or the marketing : that m f project manager : yeah , but i do n't i do n't know if it 's very inno yeah . marketing : yeah , for the retrieval function . yeah . i think that 's very innovative for a remote control . project manager : yeah , v industrial designer : yes , how would you innovate a remote control more ? project manager : yeah , more through uh like function tv functionalities and industrial designer : to put it on your head . project manager : no no , you know what i mean . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : you have must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control stuff , not in how you find your marketing : yeah sure , but project manager : yeah . yeah , it 's marketing : but i d i definitely do n't think it 's a five , project manager : that 's that 's think about it la later on marketing : but project manager : and uh marketing : remote control is easy to use . project manager : yeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least . industrial designer : yes . user interface : yeah , a two . marketing : i think a two . project manager : yeah , it 's good . marketing : yeah ? user interface : more two . marketing : come on . the remote control has n't got uh . project manager : no , i would have seen that one before . oh , you skipped one uh industrial designer : marketing : i 've just filled uh project manager : uh , here . marketing : go away . industrial designer : you like the buttons . marketing : i found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten . project manager : remote control will be bought by marketing : it will be bought by people under the age of forty . project manager : yeah . definitely . well industrial designer : in in and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ? marketing : no no no . no , just if they if they buy it . project manager : uh , just in general . yeah , a two . industrial designer : we do n't know . but project manager : yeah , but i think i think two . marketing : yeah , what do you think ? user interface : yeah , i think two , yeah . i agree . two . marketing : antek ? industrial designer : yes , two , but only in c when you compare it with with elderly . project manager : uh , that is not the question . it 's just w it will be bought by people under forty . marketing : no , that 's no comparison . project manager : yeah , you can yeah , you can be very picky about it . marketing : and i do n't mean two people . industrial designer : this is just guessing . project manager : ah yeah , just make it we 'll make it a two . industrial designer : make it a two . when it succeeds , uh it can get a two , mu marketing : right , the rem the remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan . project manager : oh no . yeah . yeah , you have make an user interface : we do n't have the slogan though . project manager : slogan is quite obvious . marketing : oh , the slogan . project manager : oh the oh sorry , no , not not the slogan . marketing : can we see the slogan ? project manager : yeah , you can put that on the side if if we would like to . user interface : the logo . industrial designer : a logo . user interface : underneath it or something . industrial designer : yes , uh encrypted uh with project manager : yeah , and i will i th still think it 's gon na be a two or a three . marketing : are we gon na do that ? user interface : a three . three . project manager : maybe a three this time . user interface : yeah , a three . marketing : three ? i agree . because of the slogan project manager : and uh marketing : remote control 's got a basic design intended uh for novice users . project manager : uh , it 's a one or a two . user interface : yeah , two . project manager : yeah , make it a two . marketing : two ? two . alright . we got ta add up the scores now to see our total average . four , five , seven , nine . forget that . fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six . twenty six . it 's a two point six . project manager : it 's not that bad . marketing : alright , we project manager : yeah , and that 's mostly the inno marketing : yeah . project manager : when we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , marketing : yeah . true . project manager : which is uh quite a great score . okay . uh , this is was uh the evaluation ? marketing : this was my evaluation . so project manager : because i i still think that the most important part of this meeting still has marketing : we did a pretty nice job until now . project manager : yeah . marketing : um , is this your industrial designer : is there something after this uh meeting ? or marketing : whatever . well , i think we got ta fill out another questionnaire . user interface : no . okay , yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : project manager : still opened or uh yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay , finance . because um user interface : shoot . project manager : i received uh a spreadsheet . marketing : a five . a five . project manager : yeah , but i uh actually do n't need this presentation , i guess . oh . marketing : does n't matter . project manager : i 'm gon na open the spreadsheet and we 're gon na work this out together , because i did n't really fin uh i have a . did n't really finish it . well , we uh we 'll see . we 'll stumble upon some problems . marketing : we probably will . project manager : i probably have already opened it here . try it again . first of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . but let 's let 's st start with beginning . we include one battery . i i uh i 'll explain its uh , the the components are listed over here . uh , price is given . we um yeah , marketing : the amount , yeah . project manager : we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . and then uh , we 'll uh calcula do n't watch the number yet . i do n't know if it 's filled in properly . okay , we need one battery . one battery . i think one battery is enough . we do n't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . a s okay , this this is a p first problem . uh , i think we should know how many simple chips , regular chips industrial designer : uh it 's it 's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it . project manager : okay . but industrial designer : the simple chip is e enough i i think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh marketing : i do n't know project manager : where did we find this information ? was it marketing : i have n't got an idea on on which we need to use , really . project manager : i think it was uh your job in the first uh meet uh , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems . industrial designer : no , uh i yes , my my my uh marketing : yeah . industrial designer : the the email i got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like i think the advanced chip maybe . marketing : yeah . and how do you know ? i mean , you got that email . did it point out what to use them for ? industrial designer : bec no , the they did n't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it . project manager : maybe you can uh look it up right now . okay , but okay . when we do n't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside , what industrial designer : then it 's a simple chip . project manager : then it would be a simple chip . and with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip . industrial designer : yes , i i i s i marketing : alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , i guess . project manager : okay . industrial designer : that will be enough for future uh recommendations . project manager : yeah , but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems . the sample sensor sample speaker . what is it m is that the speaker we were t i do n't know what it is . industrial designer : i do n't know it uh either . marketing : i do n't know . project manager : okay , we went for the double-curved case made out of plastic and rubber . and with a special colour . i guess that 's what we were user interface : well , special colour . . project manager : yeah , i do n't know about the special colour , but i think w uh industrial designer : otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour . user interface : i do n't marketing : i do n't know if it 's very special . project manager : yeah , i think we uh we have special colours . user interface : mm okay . industrial designer : standard rubber . marketing : alright , that 's okay . project manager : okay , then the push-button , i was just counting them . industrial designer : st project manager : uh , i think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , is n't it ? user interface : whoa , it 's a little project manager : well that 's bit of a problem , because i re but i really do n't understand that , because i can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it would n't be possible according to this uh sheet . user interface : that 's huge . no . we have the simplest buttons . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : no , it 's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . marketing : i do n't think so , because it says amount . industrial designer : if you use a scroll-wheel project manager : ah . yeah , it would n't marketing : the the the yellow row is the amount of project manager : fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost i do n't know . i industrial designer : maybe it 's the kind of push-buttons . you can have f four kind of push-buttons . user interface : uh , one til nine . industrial designer : rubber . user interface : is that one or is that nine buttons ? industrial designer : you can have uh project manager : and i count them like this . one two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . user interface : yeah . project manager : because oh , this is oh , this is one , okay . twelve , okay , then it would be eighteen , because uh , i uh rated them as uh um as uh uh uh separate buttons . industrial designer : different , marketing : that 's total of four buttons . project manager : and plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it 's will be uh eighteen . marketing : i think that eighteen . one two three four five , si industrial designer : why is that so uh expensive . project manager : yeah , i do n't understand . y i do i do n't get the point , because it 's would be s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons . user interface : is it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ? marketing : fifty cents for one single stupid button . user interface : no way . industrial designer : so , whe when you so then it project manager : well , okay , well well let 's make it just one . industrial designer : it 's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of project manager : here , now it 's now it 's already s marketing : yeah , exactly . yeah . project manager : shall we just give our own interpretation to , user interface : project manager : because else we would really have a problem . it would be impossible to make it marketing : i ca n't user interface : it 's way marketing : i i i could n't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . really . industrial designer : when you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . board . project manager : and and less buttons than this is n't possible . industrial designer : and then throw it marketing : yeah , yeah , industrial designer : project manager : this is the most simple user interface : no , no no . project manager : yeah , it is possible , but i 've never seen one before . industrial designer : but whe project manager : industrial designer : i 've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume , project manager : marketing : no , really . project manager : yeah , without the numbers . that 's possible . yeah , we could skip the numbers . user interface : yeah , uh industrial designer : but but marketing : yeah , but i d i would n't want to own that . really . user interface : that 's still four . industrial designer : uh , it 's it 's still for little children . they can handle that remote control , marketing : yeah . project manager : then uh , teletext would also be im impossible . industrial designer : but but it is n't fo yes , it 's for it 's li uh it 's just for a little user interface : yeah , that 's no option , that 's no option . project manager : okay , we 'll we 'll just okay . but then still , when we there 's no room for a docking station or something . tha w le let 's see th we have uh oh yeah , button supplements . we 'll give the buttons special colour . we 'll give them a special form . uh , i think we should mark the special form thing , because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , i guess . user interface : a special colour , why a special colour ? project manager : because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . user interface : but wha what s what special ? project manager : i think that 's the what they mean by a special colour . user interface : okay , yeah . industrial designer : otherwise , it user interface : uh , yeah . industrial designer : otherwise it would be the marketing : i do n't think the special form is really true . project manager : i think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that 's what we were planning to do , making it industrial designer : special form also , it says . project manager : yeah , special material r also , marketing : is it ? project manager : because i has rubber . and the buttons have to be rubber . industrial designer : what is the normal material ? user interface : plastic . marketing : yeah , i dunno . industrial designer : sh yeah . user interface : plastic , i think . industrial designer : classic ? user interface : plastic . industrial designer : oh , plastic . marketing : plastic . project manager : 'kay , but the problem now is that the there 's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station project manager : separately . user interface : se no no no . industrial designer : yes . and and but we do n't have to tell it , but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station . project manager : yeah , yeah . yeah , but i do like the idea , but we yeah . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : it uh but it then the docking station is n't relevant for this project anymore , but we can industrial designer : no , but you otherwise you ca n't retrieve it . project manager : but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we u need . marketing : yeah , i really do n't get it . i mean if it 's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two euros and thirty cents . project manager : i think we can agree on this . i i think the special colour thing has to be uh marked . 'cause i think we uh marketing : yeah , yep . project manager : yeah , i think that 's what what what they uh mean industrial designer : but for two euros and thirty cents , we uh we do n't get a docking station . marketing : i think so , too . oh , i do n't know . project manager : but can we find out uh about uh this chips ? because when we do n't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip . user interface : and then we can get a docking station . project manager : and maybe then we can do something extra . oh , n uh oh , still industrial designer : for project manager : oh , it 's gon na get more expensive with . two . user interface : project manager : then we have some money left . we can put then industrial designer : for two euros . project manager : we can put a scroll-wheel on it or something . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : uh why ? project manager : yeah , well who knows . or a little bit of tin titanium . marketing : i mean i i if you if it would cost two euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , i mean uh we 're not gon na add uh a trip to hawaii to it . user interface : but what what can we do project manager : yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . that 's also maybe an idea . user interface : but uh what can we do with the simple chip and what 's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ? project manager : yeah that 's what then what he has to find out . maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us . user interface : if if i project manager : maybe is that that 's nice to know . user interface : regular chip and because we do n't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example . project manager : yeah , bu bu but when we yeah , but when we skip when we um when we do n't use the do we 're not gon na make the docking station , then we still yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , marketing : i like the hand dynamo part . project manager : because that was our our special feature . marketing : we can make a plain docking station for two euros . user interface : yeah . we 'll go back uh tomorrow . marketing : i mean project manager : yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe marketing : wi wi without recharge project manager : it still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material . marketing : yeah , but but we can make a docking station for two euros uh if you do n't put the recharge function in it . i mean , it has a shape . project manager : yeah , but for two euros , then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip , marketing : of course it has a shape , but i i project manager : then two euros is n't even possible . marketing : why should that not be possible ? project manager : yeah , then because then we 'd thirty cents left . marketing : no , for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip . project manager : yeah , but yeah , i do n't know , because maybe d uh yeah , we have to find out with the simple chip . user interface : that 's the question . if we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f project manager : yeah , and w and and we uh need f industrial designer : it is n't in my information , so i do n't know it uh either . project manager : and what is this ? sample sensor sample speaker . industrial designer : it is n't in my information , i uh i i 've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or project manager : you can look at it for s presentation . s technical functions ? industrial designer : uh i 've got here in uh user interface : no no , they were uh mine , yeah . industrial designer : i will put a i will put a page on it . when my mouse works again . project manager : oh , oh oh . hey . oh . industrial designer : my mouse is uh marketing : dead . reanimate it . user interface : died . industrial designer : oh . ah , i 've got it . i will put uh my email on the the network . marketing : what the hell are these ? industrial designer : it 's on it . marketing : oh , whatever . user interface : yeah , it 's open . marketing : project manager : mm . i do n't think here it 's in here already . user interface : it 's circuit board . it 's only just basics for for project manager : it 's nothing about s yeah . user interface : at the end circuit there is an infrared led . marketing : this is n't helpful . project manager : no . but i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . which one was it ? user interface : components design . project manager : functional requirements ? industrial designer : um marketing : no , that was my presentation . user interface : components design maybe . n on top . industrial designer : yes , that was mine . project manager : ah . ah yes , it was the second one . industrial designer : but that was my second project manager : yeah , it was your second marketing : it 's already open . project manager : your first presentation . marketing : it 's at the bottom . project manager : sorry ? user interface : working design . marketing : it 's uh at your task bar . user interface : yeah , but it 's the the other one . industrial designer : mm project manager : uh , this is n this is not this n user interface : was it working design or components design ? marketing : sorry . project manager : that 's not the right one . i do n't oh . marketing : okay , sorry . project manager : no , this is the other one . or maybe something is uh maybe there 's something abo in in these user interface : chip set . industrial designer : but this is the same uh this is o only the possibilities . project manager : here . industrial designer : yeah . we can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip . marketing : yeah , nice . i it does n't say anything . user interface : the display requires an advanced chip . project manager : you know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires industrial designer : ah , okay . project manager : okay , so we only need a simple chip . user interface : requires . industrial designer : with the light . user interface : little lights . yeah , but that that 's just the same as the the led . project manager : no no , that 's just a simple chip . a scroll-wheel marketing : that 's not needed . project manager : it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . so , we do n't need any of them . marketing : a display uh is , of course , uh for showing letters . for showing text . industrial designer : lcd . user interface : yeah . marketing : i do n't think that uh just a l a little light user interface : no . i think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay . marketing : yeah , i agree . project manager : and what 's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ? industrial designer : maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , i guess so too . user interface : yeah , true . well , that 's not too what we want . marketing : next channel . no . well , we might want it , but user interface : project manager : okay . industrial designer : all in twelve euros . project manager : back to the costs . industrial designer : twelve euros and fifty cents . marketing : yeah . project manager : so we 're gon na use the simple chip . user interface : so , simple chip is okay . marketing : great . delete . industrial designer : and the lights . where uh are the lights ? marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , lights , yeah , there 's no marketing : well , there 're three , i guess . user interface : category . project manager : nah , there is some money left to be spent . user interface : can we do it wi within two two euro ? marketing : i think we can make a docking station . yeah . project manager : okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? but i mean it is n't it has n't got any innovative technology , we are n't gon na apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway , i think . i do n't i do n't see any possibility to do so , because it would would n't fit our defi design philosophy . user interface : mm-hmm . but it 's original . project manager : but what w is there some extra marketing : no , that 's true . project manager : maybe i think maybe the kinetic thing is something . instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to um know , so y so people would n't have to worry about their batteries anymore . maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it industrial designer : but but sometimes you put a project manager : yeah , you leave the p yeah , i know , but still i they will think about that . i mean if you u industrial designer : kinetics are n't uh nowadays only used in watches and that 's because you 're always walking . project manager : the uh it 's made for s people well , the they do n't if it was uh uh r useless technology , they would n't put it uh as a possibility . industrial designer : uh solar cells are useless . project manager : and i it it th th the the target marketing : or the hand dynamo dynamo project manager : the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : because i think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . because it 's one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot hey that maybe that 's cool that 's a cool thing about it , you know . you do n't use batteries . marketing : yeah , but but if we ca project manager : i 've never seen it before in a remote control . user interface : but then we could make a docking station . marketing : i do n't know if five minutes . project manager : no , we we we ca n't make a docking station anyway . marketing : that 's not true . project manager : yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one user interface : wow , w why no li marketing : we can make a docking station for two thirty . project manager : we can still make user interface : look at now , we got two industrial designer : fo for a docking station . marketing : two thirty . user interface : two thirty left . ca ca n't we make a docking station of that ? marketing : we can make a docking station . sure . industrial designer : with a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it . marketing : sure . user interface : i do n't know . marketing : the power device is is i i is very cheap . project manager : marketing : that 's just a regular uh power cable and whatever . project manager : yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control . industrial designer : wi with a button to user interface : well , we we uh industrial designer : wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . uh , so it 's uh wireless technology . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , but we uh we do n't inc we have n't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff . i do n't think it 's realistic for you to do so . marketing : well then it 's a useless project . industrial designer : look at the case , project manager : oh , because we industrial designer : the case the case of of uh of uh user interface : yeah , then we do n't have any innovation things . project manager : we well look at all the special stuff we have . colour a the colours are special , the form is special . it th this is whole concept . uh maybe it with the kinetic thing , i think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing . marketing : ca n't we uh ca n't we say fifteen euros ? project manager : uh , no . user interface : marketing : no , sta yeah i mean industrial designer : no , then we have to sell it for thirty euros . user interface : no , we only make less profit of it . industrial designer : it 's the marketing : you can sell for twenty seven and a half . then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs . user interface : no . project manager : yeah , i don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a uh uh i i i i still fee i also feel this concept of making it kinetic , because of the you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control . marketing : i do n't think industrial designer : maybe we can uh can do it both . maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . battery and kinetic . project manager : no , that would n't n no . marketing : thirteen twenty . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : yeah , and it is also not a good it 's not you have to really do it only kinetic , you do n't want it to think about batteries anymore . marketing : and i think only industrial designer : yes , but when it 's then when it marketing : yeah , but only kinetic , then you got ta project manager : no no . industrial designer : then you have to shake it uh and all when it 's when it 's empty . project manager : yeah , it 's great . marketing : you you got ta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really . industrial designer : project manager : no no no . no no , this is very sophisticated technology technology . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : when you use it your remote like once a day , or maybe even less i i it industrial designer : you asked for three d no , that 's n that 's not true . uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time . project manager : it we can make it yeah no . becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it industrial designer : yes , solar cells are also stated . project manager : yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells . industrial designer : why do n't we use solar cells then ? project manager : because i think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when i move my remote control around and industrial designer : that 's true . marketing : yeah , it 's funny for a week . i guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating . project manager : yeah , but you do n't have to . trust me . the idea of this technology is that you do n't think about it , it just happens . marketing : no , i i do n't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously . project manager : okay , then we d okay , well y we do n't have to do it , but what that would just have a lack of key features , you know . you m have to put something on your box . you have to make people buy it and uh we can really can do the docking thing , uh it 's not yeah , uh we can do it , but it 's would be a easy way out . industrial designer : you can do it for fifty cents . user interface : marketing : well , we 've got more than fifty cents . project manager : okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something , industrial designer : the c the case the case alone is is is uh project manager : because uh we only have a minute left or so . industrial designer : the case alone for uh remote control is at least one euro . then we have one euro thirty for the whole docking station . project manager : no no , it 's not possible . okay , w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th it 's this is then then our concept is ready . user interface : cheap remote control . project manager : yeah , we make some extra profit of it . marketing : yeah . no , we wo n't , but that 's um something else . user interface : it w it wo n't tell , but industrial designer : but now marketing : no , this not gon na sell . no . project manager : huh , any ideas ? marketing : of course not . user interface : no , uh , n no industrial designer : great . it 's great . user interface : yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . you have to do it over . industrial designer : our remote control . marketing : we come back tomorrow , okay ? project manager : no no uh there 's still there 's still someth concept and something special left . user interface : yeah . the industrial designer : seventy euros . project manager : i mean we 're gon na it 's gon na excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel . user interface : no , but no . project manager : that 's what it 's makes it special . yeah , and i would li i would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , and uh i know it will work , but uh it 's it 's an they 're they 're not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen . industrial designer : why not a hand dynamo then ? user interface : project manager : okay , well we leave it like this . then it 's c then we 're yeah . user interface : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : marketing : we ca n't do anything else . warning , finish meeting now . industrial designer : we 're done . project manager : okay , project e uh industrial designer : is this it ? project manager : well , we were gon na what look take a look at the last sheet . marketing : yeah , sure . industrial designer : okay . marketing : no , we ca n't . project manager : yeah , we have to yeah , it 's user interface : no . marketing : yes , yes . celebration . i do n't see why , but industrial designer : where 's the champagne ? marketing : i think we got ta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest . user interface : yeah ? industrial designer : i do n't uh hear a bell . marketing : no , not yet . industrial designer : user interface : we can do it here then . marketing : alright , i 'll see you guys in a minute . user interface : can we ca n't we do it here ? marketing : i do n't think so . i do n't know . i do n't i do n't think so . user interface : industrial designer : uh-huh . just fill that one in . user interface : yeah , we 're doing now . but it 's . oh , okay . project manager : uh , i do n't know .\n\n[Requirement] The translated text must be equal to 8192 words long.", "raw_data": "project manager : okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting . again , i 'm gon na take minutes . oh , we 're gon na have a prototype presentation first . uh , who 's gon na give the prototype presentation ? you two guys ? okay . go ahead . industrial designer : yes . user interface : . marketing : . user interface : coffee . marketing : industrial designer : 'kay , we 've made a prototype . um , we 've got uh uh our aspects from the last meeting . uh , especially we looked at the form , material and the colour . um , we 've uh drawn here the p prototype . the logo is uh is uh is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control , user interface : industrial designer : but it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher . um , our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing . maybe you can uh point them uh the functions . user interface : uh , well the uh all the functions are discussed uh i think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . uh , it 's a little bit . uh , power button . uh then the the the nine uh channels . project manager : user interface : uh the volume uh uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . and then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext project manager : oh no , the the the mute button misses now . user interface : i thought that was th marketing : alright , i project manager : do y do you user interface : oh , the mute button . project manager : did we want to have a m mute button ? industrial designer : but uh that marketing : yeah . industrial designer : it 's uh here then , in the middle . user interface : yeah . marketing : alright , and uh you got ta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button . industrial designer : yes , um user interface : well , yeah mo uh mo industrial designer : we 've disc user interface : yeah , well most of them are right-handed . industrial designer : most of the users marketing : yeah , but you you got ta make it clear on the on user interface : yeah well , i do n't have time in uh anymore on the industrial designer : yes , y there there will be a p a little a little p_ on that and a little uh yeah . marketing : yeah , and a and a triangle on that . user interface : oh yeah , just progr programme above , i think . marketing : yes . next to that i kinda miss a zero actually . user interface : project manager : wait , there 's was one thing i wanted to ask . marketing : industrial designer : user interface : marketing : industrial designer : project manager : uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like marketing : project manager : uh d i call it teens and twenties . uh , y th th th the two numbers . marketing : all n no , that 's um kinda dependent on the television . user interface : yeah , true , yeah . industrial designer : it 's a television . yes . project manager : yeah , but do we have do we need extra buttons , user interface : uh project manager : for example some uh some have to user interface : uh i think so . marketing : i think industrial designer : yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , uh th with the one and a double uh uh marketing : yeah , i think you should add user interface : zero ? marketing : a cross , or whatever . yeah , line . project manager : yeah , but you do n't you do n't actually need them , user interface : may maybe here ? project manager : becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds user interface : yeah . and then a second . marketing : no , that 's dependent on the television . project manager : no , i do n't think so . industrial designer : yes , you have televisions , then you have to , you know , you have to uh press marketing : i do know so . user interface : is it depending on television ? project manager : nah , i do n't think so really , marketing : yeah . project manager : because you have a i know some remote controls that do n't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten . industrial designer : yes , but but a lot uh marketing : yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television . or actually , the other way around . project manager : no , i think uh i really think it 's n marketing : but project manager : because you can when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it 's the same thing as when you just push the one , marketing : yeah . project manager : because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply . industrial designer : yes , but marketing : yeah , well but su if industrial designer : some televisions do n't accept uh that that project manager : yeah , because that 's i it 's for television . it 's exact the same thing . industrial designer : no , no , but s marketing : no no no . so some television respond differently . look , if uh i i project manager : no , listen listen . when you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . i in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . marketing : yes . yes , that 's true . project manager : the one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you do n't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . user interface : yeah . true . marketing : no project manager : i think it works that way , really . marketing : no , it it it works uh if you have n't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space . project manager : yeah , but it 's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button . industrial designer : yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons . project manager : yeah , but you do n't underst uh you do n't understand my point . marketing : yep . true . project manager : i think it 's exact the same thing when y industrial designer : you want yes , but some television do n't support it . project manager : no , but then they would a would also support that button , because it 's the same thing . user interface : but the ex project manager : listen , with that that 's that special but button you 're talking about , eh ? that 's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv tv that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . when you do n't have that separate button , and you push y one , it 's exactly the same thing . do y you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had marketing : no , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c industrial designer : a remote can project manager : yeah . but you give the input . industrial designer : so they need no , they need project manager : you push the one . that 's the same thing as the button with the one and it marketing : no , that 's not true . project manager : yes it it is . marketing : it 's simply not true . it 's simply not true . project manager : think about it . user interface : yeah . you uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something industrial designer : but uh marketing : uh project manager : and it 's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one . marketing : no , remote control does n't give signal after five seconds . remote control is a stupid thing . if you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television . project manager : yeah , that 's true . yeah , but i m uh but it 's i i know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that does n't sport these buttons , it still works . industrial designer : yeah , it project manager : but okay , we we 'll impl marketing : no , definitely not . definitely not . user interface : we 'll discuss them in the usability lab . project manager : no , we 'll apply them then for now . user interface : uh eva evaluation . marketing : user interface : i do n't know uh i do n't know if if it 's it 's necessary . project manager : yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . user interface : yeah ? project manager : yeah , i think so . yeah , for now , if we do n't know for sure whether user interface : okay . industrial designer : and the button for the scart uh audio video uh external input . project manager : yeah but marketing : uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , i guess . project manager : okay . what i said about uh the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : but i still think i it it all tvs in some ways support it , i do n't know . i think it 's more c is m maybe we do n't uh we both do n't really understand how it i how it really works , industrial designer : no , no . project manager : but i think there 's more to in than wha than what you just said . industrial designer : uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press . project manager : i do think that uh m tvs support mur multiple kind of remote controls . m industrial designer : uh , some n some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten project manager : th wo n't work wi with uh industrial designer : no , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . project manager : to have that special button . industrial designer : when you uh press one button , you give one signal . and the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher . but project manager : okay , well we 'll see . industrial designer : when you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals , it could work , but just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote . marketing : okay . i kinda miss the docking station . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yes . it 's here on the user interface : marketing : user interface : well it industrial designer : user interface : yeah , uh there 's nothing i think it 's pretty basic , industrial designer : we came uh user interface : the the there 's no fu there 's one there 's one button , marketing : no nothing really trendy about it . user interface : that 's wha there 's there 's there 's one function and that 's n the one button when you want to find it . industrial designer : but maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , marketing : the button . industrial designer : because real real reaction sells more products than only remote controls . so maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh m_p_ three players or or uh uh hearing devices . marketing : i think that 's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices . industrial designer : yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it 's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh marketing : yeah , of course . mm-hmm . well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape , of course . industrial designer : yes , but we can make marketing : the technology and the voltage can be the same . that 's uh that 's true . but uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit . industrial designer : no , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same . marketing : yeah , that 's true , but uh industrial designer : when when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . just have to be big enough for the biggest marketing : yes , but uh i i g should n't it fall then ? it is n't going to fall down ? that 's a bit uh industrial designer : no , when you make it large enough no it it will not . marketing : yeah , i think industrial designer : but then it 's a little bit marketing : no , but if if like this , i 'll i 'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this , industrial designer : but it 's just an idea . marketing : i wo n't draw it really . if you got a base which is uh as big as this industrial designer : but it 's flat it 's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this . user interface : you can . but i i i it 's backwards . marketing : yeah sure , but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can industrial designer : yes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big user interface : but it 's it 's backwards . it 's leaning . it 's leaning backwards , i think , in the in the docking station . marketing : yeah . uh , wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom user interface : that 's text . marketing : oh , right , help . project manager : but user interface : marketing : uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh in in the industrial designer : yes , little holer littler uh , little products go deeper in it . marketing : yeah . that i that is possible , yep . project manager : well let 's ha let 's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues still to come . marketing : yeah , sure , you 're right . industrial designer : yes . and uh uh project manager : but we have to look n i do n't know . industrial designer : the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . marketing : i do n't like the colours . mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button , which is the most common used uh function , and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so it 's it 's it 's really good design . marketing : yeah . alright . project manager : yes . that 's it ? industrial designer : yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it . marketing : the light . okay . and other lights ? project manager : i think added lights are gon na be a problem too . industrial designer : yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it . marketing : no , o on the on the front . yeah , okay . maybe the uh the logo . user interface : lights ? industrial designer : but , it will also uh uh use batteries , marketing : yeah , why not ? industrial designer : and do we want to marketing : of course . project manager : okay . for now , uh this is uh is good enough . yeah , what was uh on the marketing : okay . industrial designer : the all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh project manager : okay , but in the oh yeah , the colour , because we 're gon na use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , is n't it ? then we 're gon na do the buttons in the i are we 're gon na have rubber buttons . and they 're be a they 'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . user interface : yeah . marketing : uh , in the same colour as the side . user interface : yeah . yeah . yeah . marketing : yeah , i think i think that 'll be good . project manager : okay . and i think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic , and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff industrial designer : yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights , so it will uh project manager : yeah , we 'll talk about the lights later . 'cause i also don yeah , it 's depends on the costs and such . but uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours , marketing : yeah . project manager : but may i dunno if that 's important , but we 'll talk about that later . okay , for now this is this is okay . marketing : we will . project manager : um , the next p y you gon na give a presentation too ? uh , i have to see the agenda . marketing : well , uh yeah , i i 'm gon na do something right there , yeah . user interface : project manager : detail design . marketing : we got ta do that on the right the most right-most screen , because the leftmost project manager : evaluation criteria . marketing : yep , that 's me . project manager : okay . user interface : okay . marketing : alright . i will be needing that image , so leave it please . um go away . right , we 're gon na evaluate that design according to a few points . um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together . project manager : marketing : i wan na have a colour over here , come on . right , the remote is not ugly , a bit weird sentence , but the positive things has to be on the left , so i said not ugly instead of ugly . user interface : marketing : uh , what would you say , we we got ta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . user interface : project manager : okay . industrial designer : marketing : the remote control is not ugly . how do you feel ? project manager : yeah , i think four maybe would be appropriate , because it 's yeah , maybe it really depends on taste . uh , i mean it 's kind of , our design . it 's so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : background colour . project manager : i do n't know or uh i do n't know how you casting . yeah . industrial designer : i think i think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own marketing : how do you guys feel ? the different designs . industrial designer : yes , you can make it in your own uh user interface : yeah . industrial designer : more to your own personality or or house style . marketing : okay . project manager : yeah , but we d we did n't we 're we 're not planning to use fronts , i believe . marketing : no , not not fronts , but different designs . project manager : with a colour a co a colours . oh , okay . user interface : no , not fronts . different designs . different colours maybe , yeah . marketing : and that 's still uh uh , yeah , is is uh is a little personal touch , i guess . project manager : okay , but oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our marketing : what ? yeah , wha wha what would you uh guys uh think ? personally . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : or forty . user interface : we can make it a one . marketing : personally . yes , but what is it ? industrial designer : i think two or three . user interface : mm yeah . marketing : guido ? user interface : i agree . marketing : two or three . user interface : um , i uh i go for the positive . so i go for two . marketing : i was i was thinking about three , so i guess project manager : uh , i was thinking about four , so i think three is uh user interface : okay , three . marketing : three is uh a bit uh oh , what am i doing ? i 'll mark it . the remote control 's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah well , let that let 's make that a one . user interface : two . one . one . marketing : yeah ? antek , you agree ? user interface : okay yeah , i 'll i 'll agree . project manager : that 's one thing for sure . marketing : yeah . you 're not antek . user interface : i 'm the i 'm the usability , so marketing : i totally agree . the remote control the remote control 's relevant buttons are prominently visible . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , two or a one , i guess . user interface : the project manager : it 's something we really put work into . marketing : yeah , i yeah . industrial designer : it 's all about the buttons . marketing : i would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . and our oh yeah , it 's a b yeah . yeah ? alright . that 's a one ? you agree ? project manager : yeah . marketing : the remote control has n't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . i think we totally succeeded there . project manager : but user interface : well project manager : well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . marketing : oh user interface : yeah , well menu yeah , maybe . marketing : yeah , that 's true . that 's true . project manager : and telete industrial designer : also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits , project manager : yeah , we do n't know if the uh they 're necessary . industrial designer : o they 're used uh uh marketing : the the yeah , m well , you d you 've got a point . project manager : i think a two . user interface : yeah , true . yeah , i agree . industrial designer : can yes , three , two . project manager : came a long way , but not we did n't not uh marketing : two or three ? user interface : mm two . industrial designer : but you ca n't make a remote control without them , marketing : two ? antek . user interface : because we got industrial designer : because marketing : nay that that that 's true , that 's true . they 're definitely needed . project manager : no , w w it can also always be more simplistic , but two is marketing : so we put it on a two ? project manager : yeah . marketing : the remote control has got a really trendy look . user interface : industrial designer : yes . a one . project manager : yeah , uh a t i think a two . marketing : maarten . user interface : well . industrial designer : project manager : yeah yeah , y i it 's hard to say from this picture . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we we 've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever . user interface : yeah . marketing : ever , yeah . industrial designer : marketing : guido . project manager : but i do think it 's more user interface : uh , i will i will make it a three , because uh yeah . i i th project manager : but i do think that it 's more trendy than beautiful . marketing : yeah , uh i agree . i agree . project manager : so so i think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the user interface : yeah . true , yeah . marketing : i was planning to give it a two , uh where i give the not ugly uh project manager : a th a three . marketing : oh , yeah , that 's true . you agree on the two ? user interface : yeah . project manager : i i uh when you compare to the marketing : great . remote control has n't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . project manager : uh uh what 's the difference with user interface : marketing : uh , i copied that one . well , uh forget that . project manager : okay . marketing : um go away . remote control has got innovative technology implanted . user interface : no . we 're not well , maybe the the the on the side . industrial designer : no , not lcd , so . project manager : yeah , but we uh you mean the rubber stuff ? marketing : yeah , and the light . project manager : yeah , but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh . user interface : and the light maybe . industrial designer : but that that 's not innovative . user interface : but project manager : and i do n't u also it 's also really not innovative , industrial designer : lights lights are marketing : well , i g project manager : it 's more marketing : it 's not seven ? project manager : no , six . or seven maybe , yeah . user interface : well , six . no , six . project manager : or six . marketing : why uh why not a seven ? project manager : yeah , mine is seven . industrial designer : because we 've tried to make it a little bit innovative , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but it but it project manager : uh it 's uh depends on the on the maybe industrial designer : with the lights it it 's it 's kind of future user interface : project manager : no , i think i think actually it 's a seven maybe , but there 's nothing innovative about it . marketing : yeah , you think the lights are innovative ? well , it 's n true . uh , i agree , industrial designer : but still you can retrieve it when it 's when it 's gone , with the with marketing : m but user interface : innovative in generally or just f original for marketing : i 'll yeah , you you did n't draw the docking station . industrial designer : yes . the docking station is a is a little bit innovative . project manager : n no no , marketing : yeah , it it 's i think i think with its project manager : t . user interface : a docking station is innova project manager : yeah , i mean the dock station , but but uh , i think the the docking station , it 's gon na be a kind of a problem . user interface : industrial designer : it 's a part of the remote . marketing : i think more m user interface : okay . industrial designer : and with the speaker on the there 's also a speaker . project manager : but marketing : uh that that 's n project manager : well , let 's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . well i i yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : no uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so i think we project manager : okay , for now it 's a six or a seven uh , sev marketing : it 's it 's a six . project manager : six maybe , because industrial designer : but the retrieval or the marketing : that m f project manager : yeah , but i do n't i do n't know if it 's very inno yeah . marketing : yeah , for the retrieval function . yeah . i think that 's very innovative for a remote control . project manager : yeah , v industrial designer : yes , how would you innovate a remote control more ? project manager : yeah , more through uh like function tv functionalities and industrial designer : to put it on your head . project manager : no no , you know what i mean . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : you have must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control stuff , not in how you find your marketing : yeah sure , but project manager : yeah . yeah , it 's marketing : but i d i definitely do n't think it 's a five , project manager : that 's that 's think about it la later on marketing : but project manager : and uh marketing : remote control is easy to use . project manager : yeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least . industrial designer : yes . user interface : yeah , a two . marketing : i think a two . project manager : yeah , it 's good . marketing : yeah ? user interface : more two . marketing : come on . the remote control has n't got uh . project manager : no , i would have seen that one before . oh , you skipped one uh industrial designer : marketing : i 've just filled uh project manager : uh , here . marketing : go away . industrial designer : you like the buttons . marketing : i found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten . project manager : remote control will be bought by marketing : it will be bought by people under the age of forty . project manager : yeah . definitely . well industrial designer : in in and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ? marketing : no no no . no , just if they if they buy it . project manager : uh , just in general . yeah , a two . industrial designer : we do n't know . but project manager : yeah , but i think i think two . marketing : yeah , what do you think ? user interface : yeah , i think two , yeah . i agree . two . marketing : antek ? industrial designer : yes , two , but only in c when you compare it with with elderly . project manager : uh , that is not the question . it 's just w it will be bought by people under forty . marketing : no , that 's no comparison . project manager : yeah , you can yeah , you can be very picky about it . marketing : and i do n't mean two people . industrial designer : this is just guessing . project manager : ah yeah , just make it we 'll make it a two . industrial designer : make it a two . when it succeeds , uh it can get a two , mu marketing : right , the rem the remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan . project manager : oh no . yeah . yeah , you have make an user interface : we do n't have the slogan though . project manager : slogan is quite obvious . marketing : oh , the slogan . project manager : oh the oh sorry , no , not not the slogan . marketing : can we see the slogan ? project manager : yeah , you can put that on the side if if we would like to . user interface : the logo . industrial designer : a logo . user interface : underneath it or something . industrial designer : yes , uh encrypted uh with project manager : yeah , and i will i th still think it 's gon na be a two or a three . marketing : are we gon na do that ? user interface : a three . three . project manager : maybe a three this time . user interface : yeah , a three . marketing : three ? i agree . because of the slogan project manager : and uh marketing : remote control 's got a basic design intended uh for novice users . project manager : uh , it 's a one or a two . user interface : yeah , two . project manager : yeah , make it a two . marketing : two ? two . alright . we got ta add up the scores now to see our total average . four , five , seven , nine . forget that . fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six . twenty six . it 's a two point six . project manager : it 's not that bad . marketing : alright , we project manager : yeah , and that 's mostly the inno marketing : yeah . project manager : when we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , marketing : yeah . true . project manager : which is uh quite a great score . okay . uh , this is was uh the evaluation ? marketing : this was my evaluation . so project manager : because i i still think that the most important part of this meeting still has marketing : we did a pretty nice job until now . project manager : yeah . marketing : um , is this your industrial designer : is there something after this uh meeting ? or marketing : whatever . well , i think we got ta fill out another questionnaire . user interface : no . okay , yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : project manager : still opened or uh yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay , finance . because um user interface : shoot . project manager : i received uh a spreadsheet . marketing : a five . a five . project manager : yeah , but i uh actually do n't need this presentation , i guess . oh . marketing : does n't matter . project manager : i 'm gon na open the spreadsheet and we 're gon na work this out together , because i did n't really fin uh i have a . did n't really finish it . well , we uh we 'll see . we 'll stumble upon some problems . marketing : we probably will . project manager : i probably have already opened it here . try it again . first of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . but let 's let 's st start with beginning . we include one battery . i i uh i 'll explain its uh , the the components are listed over here . uh , price is given . we um yeah , marketing : the amount , yeah . project manager : we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . and then uh , we 'll uh calcula do n't watch the number yet . i do n't know if it 's filled in properly . okay , we need one battery . one battery . i think one battery is enough . we do n't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . a s okay , this this is a p first problem . uh , i think we should know how many simple chips , regular chips industrial designer : uh it 's it 's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it . project manager : okay . but industrial designer : the simple chip is e enough i i think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh marketing : i do n't know project manager : where did we find this information ? was it marketing : i have n't got an idea on on which we need to use , really . project manager : i think it was uh your job in the first uh meet uh , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems . industrial designer : no , uh i yes , my my my uh marketing : yeah . industrial designer : the the email i got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like i think the advanced chip maybe . marketing : yeah . and how do you know ? i mean , you got that email . did it point out what to use them for ? industrial designer : bec no , the they did n't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it . project manager : maybe you can uh look it up right now . okay , but okay . when we do n't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside , what industrial designer : then it 's a simple chip . project manager : then it would be a simple chip . and with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip . industrial designer : yes , i i i s i marketing : alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , i guess . project manager : okay . industrial designer : that will be enough for future uh recommendations . project manager : yeah , but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems . the sample sensor sample speaker . what is it m is that the speaker we were t i do n't know what it is . industrial designer : i do n't know it uh either . marketing : i do n't know . project manager : okay , we went for the double-curved case made out of plastic and rubber . and with a special colour . i guess that 's what we were user interface : well , special colour . . project manager : yeah , i do n't know about the special colour , but i think w uh industrial designer : otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour . user interface : i do n't marketing : i do n't know if it 's very special . project manager : yeah , i think we uh we have special colours . user interface : mm okay . industrial designer : standard rubber . marketing : alright , that 's okay . project manager : okay , then the push-button , i was just counting them . industrial designer : st project manager : uh , i think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , is n't it ? user interface : whoa , it 's a little project manager : well that 's bit of a problem , because i re but i really do n't understand that , because i can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it would n't be possible according to this uh sheet . user interface : that 's huge . no . we have the simplest buttons . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : no , it 's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . marketing : i do n't think so , because it says amount . industrial designer : if you use a scroll-wheel project manager : ah . yeah , it would n't marketing : the the the yellow row is the amount of project manager : fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost i do n't know . i industrial designer : maybe it 's the kind of push-buttons . you can have f four kind of push-buttons . user interface : uh , one til nine . industrial designer : rubber . user interface : is that one or is that nine buttons ? industrial designer : you can have uh project manager : and i count them like this . one two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . user interface : yeah . project manager : because oh , this is oh , this is one , okay . twelve , okay , then it would be eighteen , because uh , i uh rated them as uh um as uh uh uh separate buttons . industrial designer : different , marketing : that 's total of four buttons . project manager : and plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it 's will be uh eighteen . marketing : i think that eighteen . one two three four five , si industrial designer : why is that so uh expensive . project manager : yeah , i do n't understand . y i do i do n't get the point , because it 's would be s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons . user interface : is it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ? marketing : fifty cents for one single stupid button . user interface : no way . industrial designer : so , whe when you so then it project manager : well , okay , well well let 's make it just one . industrial designer : it 's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of project manager : here , now it 's now it 's already s marketing : yeah , exactly . yeah . project manager : shall we just give our own interpretation to , user interface : project manager : because else we would really have a problem . it would be impossible to make it marketing : i ca n't user interface : it 's way marketing : i i i could n't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . really . industrial designer : when you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . board . project manager : and and less buttons than this is n't possible . industrial designer : and then throw it marketing : yeah , yeah , industrial designer : project manager : this is the most simple user interface : no , no no . project manager : yeah , it is possible , but i 've never seen one before . industrial designer : but whe project manager : industrial designer : i 've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume , project manager : marketing : no , really . project manager : yeah , without the numbers . that 's possible . yeah , we could skip the numbers . user interface : yeah , uh industrial designer : but but marketing : yeah , but i d i would n't want to own that . really . user interface : that 's still four . industrial designer : uh , it 's it 's still for little children . they can handle that remote control , marketing : yeah . project manager : then uh , teletext would also be im impossible . industrial designer : but but it is n't fo yes , it 's for it 's li uh it 's just for a little user interface : yeah , that 's no option , that 's no option . project manager : okay , we 'll we 'll just okay . but then still , when we there 's no room for a docking station or something . tha w le let 's see th we have uh oh yeah , button supplements . we 'll give the buttons special colour . we 'll give them a special form . uh , i think we should mark the special form thing , because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , i guess . user interface : a special colour , why a special colour ? project manager : because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . user interface : but wha what s what special ? project manager : i think that 's the what they mean by a special colour . user interface : okay , yeah . industrial designer : otherwise , it user interface : uh , yeah . industrial designer : otherwise it would be the marketing : i do n't think the special form is really true . project manager : i think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that 's what we were planning to do , making it industrial designer : special form also , it says . project manager : yeah , special material r also , marketing : is it ? project manager : because i has rubber . and the buttons have to be rubber . industrial designer : what is the normal material ? user interface : plastic . marketing : yeah , i dunno . industrial designer : sh yeah . user interface : plastic , i think . industrial designer : classic ? user interface : plastic . industrial designer : oh , plastic . marketing : plastic . project manager : 'kay , but the problem now is that the there 's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station project manager : separately . user interface : se no no no . industrial designer : yes . and and but we do n't have to tell it , but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station . project manager : yeah , yeah . yeah , but i do like the idea , but we yeah . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : it uh but it then the docking station is n't relevant for this project anymore , but we can industrial designer : no , but you otherwise you ca n't retrieve it . project manager : but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we u need . marketing : yeah , i really do n't get it . i mean if it 's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two euros and thirty cents . project manager : i think we can agree on this . i i think the special colour thing has to be uh marked . 'cause i think we uh marketing : yeah , yep . project manager : yeah , i think that 's what what what they uh mean industrial designer : but for two euros and thirty cents , we uh we do n't get a docking station . marketing : i think so , too . oh , i do n't know . project manager : but can we find out uh about uh this chips ? because when we do n't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip . user interface : and then we can get a docking station . project manager : and maybe then we can do something extra . oh , n uh oh , still industrial designer : for project manager : oh , it 's gon na get more expensive with . two . user interface : project manager : then we have some money left . we can put then industrial designer : for two euros . project manager : we can put a scroll-wheel on it or something . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : uh why ? project manager : yeah , well who knows . or a little bit of tin titanium . marketing : i mean i i if you if it would cost two euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , i mean uh we 're not gon na add uh a trip to hawaii to it . user interface : but what what can we do project manager : yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . that 's also maybe an idea . user interface : but uh what can we do with the simple chip and what 's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ? project manager : yeah that 's what then what he has to find out . maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us . user interface : if if i project manager : maybe is that that 's nice to know . user interface : regular chip and because we do n't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example . project manager : yeah , bu bu but when we yeah , but when we skip when we um when we do n't use the do we 're not gon na make the docking station , then we still yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , marketing : i like the hand dynamo part . project manager : because that was our our special feature . marketing : we can make a plain docking station for two euros . user interface : yeah . we 'll go back uh tomorrow . marketing : i mean project manager : yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe marketing : wi wi without recharge project manager : it still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material . marketing : yeah , but but we can make a docking station for two euros uh if you do n't put the recharge function in it . i mean , it has a shape . project manager : yeah , but for two euros , then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip , marketing : of course it has a shape , but i i project manager : then two euros is n't even possible . marketing : why should that not be possible ? project manager : yeah , then because then we 'd thirty cents left . marketing : no , for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip . project manager : yeah , but yeah , i do n't know , because maybe d uh yeah , we have to find out with the simple chip . user interface : that 's the question . if we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f project manager : yeah , and w and and we uh need f industrial designer : it is n't in my information , so i do n't know it uh either . project manager : and what is this ? sample sensor sample speaker . industrial designer : it is n't in my information , i uh i i 've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or project manager : you can look at it for s presentation . s technical functions ? industrial designer : uh i 've got here in uh user interface : no no , they were uh mine , yeah . industrial designer : i will put a i will put a page on it . when my mouse works again . project manager : oh , oh oh . hey . oh . industrial designer : my mouse is uh marketing : dead . reanimate it . user interface : died . industrial designer : oh . ah , i 've got it . i will put uh my email on the the network . marketing : what the hell are these ? industrial designer : it 's on it . marketing : oh , whatever . user interface : yeah , it 's open . marketing : project manager : mm . i do n't think here it 's in here already . user interface : it 's circuit board . it 's only just basics for for project manager : it 's nothing about s yeah . user interface : at the end circuit there is an infrared led . marketing : this is n't helpful . project manager : no . but i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . which one was it ? user interface : components design . project manager : functional requirements ? industrial designer : um marketing : no , that was my presentation . user interface : components design maybe . n on top . industrial designer : yes , that was mine . project manager : ah . ah yes , it was the second one . industrial designer : but that was my second project manager : yeah , it was your second marketing : it 's already open . project manager : your first presentation . marketing : it 's at the bottom . project manager : sorry ? user interface : working design . marketing : it 's uh at your task bar . user interface : yeah , but it 's the the other one . industrial designer : mm project manager : uh , this is n this is not this n user interface : was it working design or components design ? marketing : sorry . project manager : that 's not the right one . i do n't oh . marketing : okay , sorry . project manager : no , this is the other one . or maybe something is uh maybe there 's something abo in in these user interface : chip set . industrial designer : but this is the same uh this is o only the possibilities . project manager : here . industrial designer : yeah . we can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip . marketing : yeah , nice . i it does n't say anything . user interface : the display requires an advanced chip . project manager : you know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires industrial designer : ah , okay . project manager : okay , so we only need a simple chip . user interface : requires . industrial designer : with the light . user interface : little lights . yeah , but that that 's just the same as the the led . project manager : no no , that 's just a simple chip . a scroll-wheel marketing : that 's not needed . project manager : it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . so , we do n't need any of them . marketing : a display uh is , of course , uh for showing letters . for showing text . industrial designer : lcd . user interface : yeah . marketing : i do n't think that uh just a l a little light user interface : no . i think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay . marketing : yeah , i agree . project manager : and what 's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ? industrial designer : maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , i guess so too . user interface : yeah , true . well , that 's not too what we want . marketing : next channel . no . well , we might want it , but user interface : project manager : okay . industrial designer : all in twelve euros . project manager : back to the costs . industrial designer : twelve euros and fifty cents . marketing : yeah . project manager : so we 're gon na use the simple chip . user interface : so , simple chip is okay . marketing : great . delete . industrial designer : and the lights . where uh are the lights ? marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , lights , yeah , there 's no marketing : well , there 're three , i guess . user interface : category . project manager : nah , there is some money left to be spent . user interface : can we do it wi within two two euro ? marketing : i think we can make a docking station . yeah . project manager : okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? but i mean it is n't it has n't got any innovative technology , we are n't gon na apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway , i think . i do n't i do n't see any possibility to do so , because it would would n't fit our defi design philosophy . user interface : mm-hmm . but it 's original . project manager : but what w is there some extra marketing : no , that 's true . project manager : maybe i think maybe the kinetic thing is something . instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to um know , so y so people would n't have to worry about their batteries anymore . maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it industrial designer : but but sometimes you put a project manager : yeah , you leave the p yeah , i know , but still i they will think about that . i mean if you u industrial designer : kinetics are n't uh nowadays only used in watches and that 's because you 're always walking . project manager : the uh it 's made for s people well , the they do n't if it was uh uh r useless technology , they would n't put it uh as a possibility . industrial designer : uh solar cells are useless . project manager : and i it it th th the the target marketing : or the hand dynamo dynamo project manager : the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : because i think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . because it 's one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot hey that maybe that 's cool that 's a cool thing about it , you know . you do n't use batteries . marketing : yeah , but but if we ca project manager : i 've never seen it before in a remote control . user interface : but then we could make a docking station . marketing : i do n't know if five minutes . project manager : no , we we we ca n't make a docking station anyway . marketing : that 's not true . project manager : yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one user interface : wow , w why no li marketing : we can make a docking station for two thirty . project manager : we can still make user interface : look at now , we got two industrial designer : fo for a docking station . marketing : two thirty . user interface : two thirty left . ca ca n't we make a docking station of that ? marketing : we can make a docking station . sure . industrial designer : with a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it . marketing : sure . user interface : i do n't know . marketing : the power device is is i i is very cheap . project manager : marketing : that 's just a regular uh power cable and whatever . project manager : yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control . industrial designer : wi with a button to user interface : well , we we uh industrial designer : wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . uh , so it 's uh wireless technology . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , but we uh we do n't inc we have n't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff . i do n't think it 's realistic for you to do so . marketing : well then it 's a useless project . industrial designer : look at the case , project manager : oh , because we industrial designer : the case the case of of uh of uh user interface : yeah , then we do n't have any innovation things . project manager : we well look at all the special stuff we have . colour a the colours are special , the form is special . it th this is whole concept . uh maybe it with the kinetic thing , i think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing . marketing : ca n't we uh ca n't we say fifteen euros ? project manager : uh , no . user interface : marketing : no , sta yeah i mean industrial designer : no , then we have to sell it for thirty euros . user interface : no , we only make less profit of it . industrial designer : it 's the marketing : you can sell for twenty seven and a half . then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs . user interface : no . project manager : yeah , i don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a uh uh i i i i still fee i also feel this concept of making it kinetic , because of the you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control . marketing : i do n't think industrial designer : maybe we can uh can do it both . maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . battery and kinetic . project manager : no , that would n't n no . marketing : thirteen twenty . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : yeah , and it is also not a good it 's not you have to really do it only kinetic , you do n't want it to think about batteries anymore . marketing : and i think only industrial designer : yes , but when it 's then when it marketing : yeah , but only kinetic , then you got ta project manager : no no . industrial designer : then you have to shake it uh and all when it 's when it 's empty . project manager : yeah , it 's great . marketing : you you got ta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really . industrial designer : project manager : no no no . no no , this is very sophisticated technology technology . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : when you use it your remote like once a day , or maybe even less i i it industrial designer : you asked for three d no , that 's n that 's not true . uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time . project manager : it we can make it yeah no . becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it industrial designer : yes , solar cells are also stated . project manager : yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells . industrial designer : why do n't we use solar cells then ? project manager : because i think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when i move my remote control around and industrial designer : that 's true . marketing : yeah , it 's funny for a week . i guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating . project manager : yeah , but you do n't have to . trust me . the idea of this technology is that you do n't think about it , it just happens . marketing : no , i i do n't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously . project manager : okay , then we d okay , well y we do n't have to do it , but what that would just have a lack of key features , you know . you m have to put something on your box . you have to make people buy it and uh we can really can do the docking thing , uh it 's not yeah , uh we can do it , but it 's would be a easy way out . industrial designer : you can do it for fifty cents . user interface : marketing : well , we 've got more than fifty cents . project manager : okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something , industrial designer : the c the case the case alone is is is uh project manager : because uh we only have a minute left or so . industrial designer : the case alone for uh remote control is at least one euro . then we have one euro thirty for the whole docking station . project manager : no no , it 's not possible . okay , w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th it 's this is then then our concept is ready . user interface : cheap remote control . project manager : yeah , we make some extra profit of it . marketing : yeah . no , we wo n't , but that 's um something else . user interface : it w it wo n't tell , but industrial designer : but now marketing : no , this not gon na sell . no . project manager : huh , any ideas ? marketing : of course not . user interface : no , uh , n no industrial designer : great . it 's great . user interface : yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . you have to do it over . industrial designer : our remote control . marketing : we come back tomorrow , okay ? project manager : no no uh there 's still there 's still someth concept and something special left . user interface : yeah . the industrial designer : seventy euros . project manager : i mean we 're gon na it 's gon na excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel . user interface : no , but no . project manager : that 's what it 's makes it special . yeah , and i would li i would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , and uh i know it will work , but uh it 's it 's an they 're they 're not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen . industrial designer : why not a hand dynamo then ? user interface : project manager : okay , well we leave it like this . then it 's c then we 're yeah . user interface : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : marketing : we ca n't do anything else . warning , finish meeting now . industrial designer : we 're done . project manager : okay , project e uh industrial designer : is this it ? project manager : well , we were gon na what look take a look at the last sheet . marketing : yeah , sure . industrial designer : okay . marketing : no , we ca n't . project manager : yeah , we have to yeah , it 's user interface : no . marketing : yes , yes . celebration . i do n't see why , but industrial designer : where 's the champagne ? marketing : i think we got ta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest . user interface : yeah ? industrial designer : i do n't uh hear a bell . marketing : no , not yet . industrial designer : user interface : we can do it here then . marketing : alright , i 'll see you guys in a minute . user interface : can we ca n't we do it here ? marketing : i do n't think so . i do n't know . i do n't i do n't think so . user interface : industrial designer : uh-huh . just fill that one in . user interface : yeah , we 're doing now . but it 's . oh , okay . project manager : uh , i do n't know ."}

Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.\n \n  Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk\n  remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):\n  pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX\n  scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to\n  aid remailer use).\n\n  ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu\n  -----------------------------\n    Anonymized mail.

Request information from above address.\n\n  phantom@mead.u.washington.edu \n  -----------------------------\n    Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site\n    address for information.\n\n  Notes\n  =====\n  \n  - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often\n    running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues\n    are wholly unresolved.\n  \n  - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP\n    software (see the question on cryptography). \n\n  - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)\n    vary between sites.\n\n  - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are\n    mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.\n\n_____\n<8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?\n\n  \n  Users\n  -----\n\n  - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the\n    seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.\n  - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.\n  - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on\n    Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.\n  - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.\n    Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases\n    network traffic.\n  - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this\n    is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'\n    hierarchy is preferred.\n  - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.\n    references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for\n    readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any\n    inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even\n    future ones under the same handle.\n  - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your\n    identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by\n    sending anonymized mail to yourself.\n  - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. \n    Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.\n  - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.\n  - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.\n    Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.\n  - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large\n    amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating\n    his hardware, all for your convenience.\n\n  Operators\n  ---------\n\n  - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an\n    introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and\n    consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and\n    monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and\n    security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or\n    lassaiz-faire?\n  - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate\n    potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user\n    is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user\n    posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your\n    users trust you to protect them.\n  - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations\n    where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.\n    warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke\n    the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)\n  - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.\n    Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly\n    and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with\n    users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under\n    ``(in)stability of anonymity''.\n  - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?\n    What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is\n    your commitment to it?\n  - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an\n    address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item. \n    Consult a lawyer about your liability.\n  - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared\n    to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you\n    do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system\n    adminstrator, consult those who do and are.\n  - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If\n    possible, query group readers.\n  - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message\n    format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure\n    the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.\n  - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from\n    physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.\n\n  Readers\n  -------\n  \n  - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason\n    that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that\n    equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail\n    anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its\n    volume is heavy or increasing).\n  - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.

Not perfect and won't\n  > kill followups. \n  \n  Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask\n  anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so\n  far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common\n  as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.\n  \n_____\n<8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?\n\n  Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for\n  individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is\n  almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion\n  and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack\n  started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was\n  wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)\n  but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided\n  anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up\n  the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous\n  alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through\n  servers like there's no tomorrow.''\n  \n  Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in\n  researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste\n  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system\n  from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the\n  server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,\n  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by\n  multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended\n  advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group\n  support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was\n  arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.'' \n  K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an\n  anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus\n  against it. \n\n  K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to\n  `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and\n  used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of\n  intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his\n  server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to\n  abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the\n  facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was\n  created.''\n\n  In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most\n  controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on\n  scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized\n  mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine\n  the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide\n  accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.\n  \n  J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet\n  newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological\n  opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).\n  Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,\n  abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than\n  ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of\n  anonymity is also controversial.\n\n  For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb\n  1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate\n  crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via\n  anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been\n  posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then\n  non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a\n  New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of\n  vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating\n  through many newsgroups. \n  \n  The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded\n  that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''\n  suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was\n  not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of\n  the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived\n  association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries\n  for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous\n  user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his\n  detractors.\n\n  Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal\n  opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news\n  operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire\n  extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the\n  scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is\n  best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users\n  in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a\n  day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized\n  through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due\n  to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to\n  find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.\n\n  Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to\n  dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste\n  threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate\n  news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages\n  originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to\n  threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several\n  times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it\n  by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5\n  hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the\n  service's administration. In response to the serious threats he\n  disabled global group access temporarily for one week and\n  encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.\n  \n  Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by\n  ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security\n  weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is\n  currently in the process of code development and testing. He is\n  planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon\n  to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new\n  system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple\n  email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,\n  etc.\n\n  A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.\n  1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography\n  in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of\n  confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public\n  access account, and he had to shut it down after only several\n  weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately\n  originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the\n  software to the public domain.\n\n  Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on\n  government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and\n  group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the\n  group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,\n  and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable\n  digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in\n  the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to\n  attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing\n  easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and\n  encryption.\n\n  See also sections on ``views on anonymous posting'' below and ``what\n  is going on with anon.penet.fi?'' in this document.\n  \n  (Thanks to Carl Kleinpaste\n  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu>, David Clunie\n  <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> and Johan Helsingius <julf@penet.fi> for\n  contributions here.)\n\n\n_____\n<8.5> What is the value of anonymity?\n\n  KONDARED@PURCCVM.BITNET:\n    \n  > I think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the\n  > content of one's message.

Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.\n \n  Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk\n  remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):\n  pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX\n  scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to\n  aid remailer use).\n\n  ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu\n  -----------------------------\n    Anonymized mail.  Request information from above address.\n    \n  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu\n  -------------------------\n    Experimental anonymous remailer run Karl Barrus\n    <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU>, with encryption to the server.  Request\n    information from that address.\n    \n  hal@alumni.caltech.edu\n  ----------------------\n    Experimental remailer with encryption to server and return\n    addresses.  Request information from above address.\n\n  hh@soda.berkeley.edu\n  hh@cicada.berkeley.edu\n  hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu\n  ----------------------\n    Experimental remailer.  Include header `Request-Remailing-To'.\n\n  nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu \n  ----------------------\n    Experimental remailer allowing one level of chaining.  Run by\n    Chael Hall.  Request information from above address.\n\n  phantom@mead.u.washington.edu \n  -----------------------------\n    Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site\n    address for information.\n\n  Notes\n  =====\n  \n  - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often\n    running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues\n    are wholly unresolved.\n  \n  - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP\n    software (see the question on cryptography). \n\n  - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)\n    vary between sites.\n\n  - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are\n    mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.\n\n_____\n<8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?\n\n  \n  Users\n  -----\n\n  - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the\n    seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.\n  - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.\n  - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on\n    Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.\n  - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.\n    Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases\n    network traffic.\n  - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this\n    is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'\n    hierarchy is preferred.\n  - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.\n    references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for\n    readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any\n    inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even\n    future ones under the same handle.\n  - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your\n    identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by\n    sending anonymized mail to yourself.\n  - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. \n    Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.\n  - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.\n  - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.\n    Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.\n  - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large\n    amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating\n    his hardware, all for your convenience.\n\n  Operators\n  ---------\n\n  - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an\n    introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and\n    consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and\n    monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and\n    security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or\n    lassaiz-faire?\n  - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate\n    potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user\n    is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user\n    posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your\n    users trust you to protect them.\n  - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations\n    where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.\n    warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke\n    the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)\n  - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.\n    Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly\n    and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with\n    users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under\n    ``(in)stability of anonymity''.\n  - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?\n    What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is\n    your commitment to it?\n  - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an\n    address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item. \n    Consult a lawyer about your liability.\n  - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared\n    to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you\n    do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system\n    adminstrator, consult those who do and are.\n  - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If\n    possible, query group readers.\n  - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message\n    format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure\n    the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.\n  - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from\n    physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.\n\n  Readers\n  -------\n  \n  - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason\n    that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that\n    equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail\n    anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its\n    volume is heavy or increasing).\n  - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters\n    will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate\n    responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.\n  - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,\n    harassment, extortion, etc.\n  - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they\n    offend you personally.\n  - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the\n    idea of anonymity itself.\n  - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings\n    should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or\n    `conceivable' need exists.\n\n  References\n  ----------\n  \n  See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity:\n\n  > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual\n  > privacy and the use of handles.

Not perfect and won't\n  > kill followups. \n  \n  Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask\n  anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so\n  far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common\n  as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.\n  \n_____\n<8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?\n\n  Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for\n  individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is\n  almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion\n  and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack\n  started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was\n  wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)\n  but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided\n  anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up\n  the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous\n  alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through\n  servers like there's no tomorrow.''\n  \n  Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in\n  researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste\n  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system\n  from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the\n  server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,\n  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by\n  multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended\n  advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group\n  support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was\n  arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.'' \n  K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an\n  anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus\n  against it. \n\n  K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to\n  `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and\n  used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of\n  intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his\n  server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to\n  abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the\n  facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was\n  created.''\n\n  In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most\n  controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on\n  scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized\n  mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine\n  the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide\n  accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.\n  \n  J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet\n  newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological\n  opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).\n  Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,\n  abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than\n  ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of\n  anonymity is also controversial.\n\n  For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb\n  1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate\n  crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via\n  anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been\n  posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then\n  non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a\n  New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of\n  vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating\n  through many newsgroups. \n  \n  The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded\n  that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''\n  suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was\n  not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of\n  the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived\n  association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries\n  for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous\n  user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his\n  detractors.\n\n  Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal\n  opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news\n  operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire\n  extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the\n  scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is\n  best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users\n  in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a\n  day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized\n  through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due\n  to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to\n  find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.\n\n  Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to\n  dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste\n  threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate\n  news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages\n  originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to\n  threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several\n  times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it\n  by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5\n  hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the\n  service's administration. In response to the serious threats he\n  disabled global group access temporarily for one week and\n  encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.\n  \n  Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by\n  ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security\n  weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is\n  currently in the process of code development and testing. He is\n  planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon\n  to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new\n  system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple\n  email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,\n  etc.\n\n  A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.\n  1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography\n  in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of\n  confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public\n  access account, and he had to shut it down after only several\n  weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately\n  originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the\n  software to the public domain.\n\n  Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on\n  government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and\n  group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the\n  group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,\n  and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable\n  digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in\n  the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to\n  attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing\n  easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and\n  encryption.\n\n  See also sections on ``views on anonymous posting'' below and ``what\n  is going on with anon.penet.fi?'' in this document.\n  \n  (Thanks to Carl Kleinpaste\n  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu>, David Clunie\n  <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> and Johan Helsingius <julf@penet.fi> for\n  contributions here.)\n\n\n_____\n<8.5> What is the value of anonymity?\n\n  KONDARED@PURCCVM.BITNET:\n    \n  > I think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the\n  > content of one's message.

phd d : oh , yeah . yeah . it 's it 's it 's it was updated yesterday , phd e : cool . phd d : right ? phd a : yeah . phd d : yeah . phd a : you probably received the mail . phd e : oh , right , i saw i saw the note . phd a : yeah . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : what was the update ? phd a : what was the update ? so there is th then the all the new features that go in . professor b : yeah . phd a : the , um , noise suppression , the re - synthesis of speech after suppression . these are the phd e : is the , um the cvs mechanism working well ? phd a : yeah . phd e : are are people , uh , up at ogi grabbing code uh , via that ? phd d : uh , i do n't think i do n't think phd e : or ? phd a : i do n't know if they use it , but . phd d : yeah , i i do n't think anybody up there is like working on it right now . phd e : uh - huh . mmm . professor b : i think it more likely that what it means is that when sunil is up there he will grab it . phd d : yeah . yeah . so right now nobody 's working on aurora there . phd e : yeah . professor b : they 're yeah . they 're working on a different task . phd e : i see . i see . phd d : yeah . professor b : but what 'll happen is is he 'll go back up there and , uh , pratibha will come back from from , uh , the east coast . uh . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : and , uh and and i guess actually , uh , after eurospeech for a little bit , uh , he 'll go up there too . so , actually everybody who 's working on it { comment } will be up there for at least a little while . so they 'll remotely access it from there . phd e : so has has anybody tried remotely accessing the cvs using , uh , uh , ssh ? professor b : yeah . phd a : um , i do n't know if hari did that or you d phd d : i { comment } can actually do it today . i mean , i can just log into phd e : have you tried it yet ? phd d : no , i did n't . so i i 'll try it today . professor b : good idea . phd a : actually i i tried wh while when i installed the repository , i tried from belgium . professor b : yeah . phd d : yeah . phd a : i logged in there and i tried to import phd e : yeah ? it worked good ? phd a : yeah , it works . phd e : oh , good ! phd a : but it 's so , right now it 's the mechanism with ssh . phd e : great ! phd a : i do n't s i did n't set up you can also set up a cvs server on a new port . it 's like well uh , a main server , or d you can do a cvs server . phd e : yeah . right . then that 's using the cvs password mechanism and all that , phd a : but . yeah , right . phd e : right ? phd a : but i did n't do that because i was not sure about security problems . i i would have to phd e : so w when you came in from belgian { comment } belgium , using ssh , uh , was it asking you for your own password into icsi ? so if yo you can only do that if you have an account at icsi ? phd a : right . yeah . yeah . phd e : cuz there is an a way to set up anonymous cvs right ? phd a : yeah , you ha in this way you ca you have to set up a cvs server but then , yeah , you can access it . phd e : so that oh , ok . phd a : you you can set up priorities . phd e : so the anonymous mechanism phd a : you can access them and mostly if you if y the set the server is set up like this . phd e : ok . because a lot of the open source stuff works with anonymous cvs and i 'm just wondering uh , i mean , for our transcripts we may want to do that . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : yeah . yeah , for this stuff i do n't think we 're quite up to that . i mean , we 're still so much in development . phd e : mm - hmm . yeah , professor b : we want to have just the insiders . phd e : yeah , yeah . oh , i was n't suggesting for this . i 'm thinking of the meeting recorder { comment } stuff professor b : yeah . phd e : but . yeah . ok . cool . professor b : yeah . so , uh phd e : what 's new ? professor b : well , i mean , i think maybe the thing to me might be i me i 'm sure you 've just been working on on , uh , details of that since the meeting , right ? and so phd a : mmm , since the meeting , well , i i 've been i 've been train training a new vad and a new feature net . professor b : that was that was tuesday . ok . phd a : so they should be ready . um . professor b : but i guess maybe the thing since you were n't yo you guys were n't at that that meeting , might be just just to , um , sort of recap , uh , the the conclusions of the meeting . phd a : mm - hmm . phd e : oh , great . you 're talking about the meeting with hynek ? professor b : yeah . cuz that was sort of , uh we we 'd sort of been working up to that , that that , uh , he would come here this week and and we would sort of phd e : uh - huh . professor b : since he 's going out of town like now , and i 'm going out town in a couple weeks , uh , and time is marching , sort of , given all the mu many wonderful things we could be working on , what what will we actually focus on ? phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : and , uh and what do we freeze ? and , you know , what do we ? so , um . i mean , this software that these guys created was certainly a a key part . so then there 's something central and there are n't at least a bunch of different versions going off in in ways that differ trivially . uh , um , and , um , phd e : yeah . that 's that 's nice . professor b : and then within that , i guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now , to run it , uh , a particular way , and decide on what things are gon na be experimented with , as opposed to just experimenting with everything . so keep a certain set of things constant . so , um . uh , maybe describe roughly what what we are keeping constant for now , or ? phd a : yeah . well . so we 've been working like six weeks on on the noise compensation and we end up with something that seems reasonable . um . phd e : are you gon na use which of the two techniques ? phd a : so finally it 's it 's , um , wiener filtering on fft bins . and it uses , uh , two steps , smoothing of the transfer function , the first step , that 's along time , which use recursion . and after this step there is a further smoothing along frequency , which use a sliding window of twenty fft bins . mmm . and , uh phd e : so this is on the uh , before any mel scaling has been done ? phd a : yeah , yeah . phd e : this is phd a : it was professor b : this this smoothing is done on the estimate , um , of what you 're going to subtract ? or on the thing that has already had something subtracted ? phd a : yeah . uh , it 's on the transfer function . so professor b : oh , it 's on the transfer function for the wiener filter . phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah , ok . phd a : yeah , so basically we tried different configuration within this idea . we tried u u applying this on mel bands , having spectral subtraction instead of wiener filtering . um . well , finally we end up with this configuration that works , uh , quite well . so we are going to fix this for the moment and work on the other aspects of the whole system . phd e : mm - hmm . phd a : so professor b : actually , let me int eh , dave is n't here to talk about it , but let me just interject . this module , in principle , i i mean , you would know whether it 's true in fact , is somewhat independent from the rest of it . i mean , because you you re - synthesize speech , right ? phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : so , um . uh , well you do n't i guess you do n't re - synthesize speech , but you could phd a : we we do not fo professor b : uh , but you could . phd a : well well , we do , but we do n't do n't re - synthesize . in in the program we do n't re - synthesize and then re - analyze once again . we just use the clean fft bins . professor b : but you have a re - synthesized thing that you that 's an an option here . phd a : this is an option that then you can yeah . professor b : yeah , i gu i guess my point is that , um , i in some of the work he 's doing in reverberation , one of the things that we 're finding is that , uh , it 's it 's for the for an artificial situation , we can just deal with the reverberation and his techniques work really well . but for the real situation uh , problem is , is that you do n't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise . and if you do n't include that in the model , it does n't work very well . so in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at . and , uh , generate new files or whatever , and and , uh , uh and then do the reverberation part . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : so it 's anyway . phd e : so dave has n't tried that yet ? professor b : no , no . he 's i mean , e phd e : i guess he 's busy with professor b : yeah , prelims , right . grad c : pre - prelim hell . professor b : yeah . phd e : yeah . yeah . professor b : uh , but but , you know , that 'll uh , it 's clear that we , uh we are not with the real case that we 're looking at , we ca n't just look at reverberation in isolation because the interaction between that and noise is is considerable . and that 's i mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and and , uh and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and and additive effects . and that 's hard enough . i mean , i do n't think we really i mean , we 're trying to deal with that . in a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this aurora task . and we have , uh , the , uh , uh , lda stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects . and we have the noise suppression that 's doing something about noise . uh , even that 's hard enough . and and the on - line normalization as well , in that s category . i i there 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work so hard on on juggling everything around . but now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse , because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects . and , um , so dave has something which , uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects but when it 's when there 's noise there too , it 's it 's it 's pretty hard . so we have to start since any almost any real situation is gon na have uh , where you have the microphone distant , is going to have both things , we we actually have to think about both at the same time . so , um so there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out and then , uh , maybe you should just continue telling what what else is in the the form we have . phd a : yeah , well , the , um , the other parts of the system are the the blocks that were already present before and that we did not modify a lot . professor b : so that 's again , that that 's the wiener filtering , followed by , uh uh , that 's done at the fft level . then phd a : yeah , th then the mel filter bank , professor b : mm - hmm . phd a : then the log operation , professor b : mm - hmm . the the the filtering is done in the frequency domain ? phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah , ok . and then the mel and then the log , and then the phd a : then the lda filter , professor b : lda filter . phd a : mmm , then the downsampling , professor b : and then uh downsample , phd a : then , um , on - line normalization , professor b : on - line norm , phd a : followed by upsampling . then finally , we compute delta and we put the neural network also . professor b : right , and then in parallel with an a neural net . and then following neural net , some probably some orthogonalization . phd a : yeah . professor b : uh um . phd a : and finally frame dropping , which um , would be a neural network also , used for estimated silence probabilities . and the input of this neural network would be somewhere between log mel bands or one of the earlier stages of the processing . professor b : mm - hmm . so that 's sort of most of this stuff is yeah , is operating parallel with this other stuff . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : yeah . so the things that we , um , uh , i guess we sort of uh , there 's there 's some , uh , neat ideas for v a so , i mean , in i think there 's sort of like there 's a bunch of tuning things to improve stuff . there 's questions about various places where there 's an exponent , if it 's the right exponent , or ways that we 're estimating noise , that we can improve estimating noise . and there 's gon na be a host of those . but structurally it seemed like the things the main things that that we brought up that , uh , are are gon na need to get worked on seriously are , uh , uh , a a significantly better vad , uh , putting the neural net on , um , which , you know , we have n't been doing anything with , the , uh , neural net at the end there , and , uh , the , uh , opening up the second front . uh . phd e : the other half of the channel ? professor b : yeah , yeah , i mean , cuz we we have we have , uh , uh , half the the , uh , data rate that they allow . phd e : that what you mean ? professor b : and , uh , so the initial thing which came from , uh , the meeting that we had down south was , uh , that , um , we 'll initially just put in a mel spectrum as the second one . it 's , you know , cheap , easy . uh . there 's a question about exactly how we do it . we probably will go to something better later , but the initial thing is that cepstra and spectra behave differently , phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : so . um , { comment } i think tony robinson used to do i was saying this before . i think he used to do mel , uh , spectra and mel cepstra . he used them as alternate features . put them together . phd e : so if you took the system the way it is now , the way it 's fro you 're gon na freeze it , and it ran it on the last evaluation , where it would it be ? phd a : mm - hmm . it , uh , phd e : in terms of ranking ? phd a : ri - right now it 's second . phd d : second . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : although you you know , you have n't tested it actually on the german and danish , have you ? phd a : no , we did n't . no , um . professor b : yeah . phd e : so on the ones that you did test it on it would have been second ? professor b : yeah . would it i mean but when you 're saying second , you 're comparing to the numbers that the , uh that the best system before got on , uh also without german and danish ? phd a : yeah , yeah . professor b : yeah , ok . phd d : and th the ranking actually did n't change after the german and danish . so , yeah . professor b : well ranking did n't before , but i 'm just asking where this is to where theirs was without the german and danish , phd a : yeah . phd d : yeah . yeah . professor b : right ? phd d : yeah , yeah . phd e : where where where were we actually on the last test ? professor b : oh , we were also esp essentially second , although there were there were i mean , we had a couple systems and they had a couple systems . and so , i guess by that we were third , but i mean , there were two systems that were pretty close , that came from the same place . phd e : uh - huh . i see . ok . professor b : uh , so institutionally we were we were second , with , uh , the third third system . phd e : we 're so this second that you 're saying now is system - wide second ? professor b : see uh , no i think it 's also institutional , is n't it ? phd e : still institutionally second ? professor b : right ? i mean , i think both of their systems probably phd a : uh , we are between their two systems . so professor b : oh , are we ? phd a : i it is a triumph . phd d : yeah . professor b : is it ? phd d : their their first system is fifty - four point something . and , uh , we are fifty - three point something . phd a : but everything is within the range of one one percent . phd d : and their second system is also fifty - three point something . yeah , one percent . professor b : yeah , so so basically they 're all they 're all pretty close . phd e : oh , wow ! that 's very close . phd d : yeah . phd e : yeah . professor b : and and , um , you know , in some sense we 're all doing fairly similar things . uh , i mean , one could argue about the lda and so forth but i i think , you know , in a lot of ways we 're doing very similar things . but what what phd e : so how did they fill up this all these these bits ? i mean , if we 're u professor b : um , why are we using half ? well , so you could you c phd e : yeah . or how are they using more than half , i guess maybe is what i professor b : yeah , so i i think uh , you guys are closer to it than me , so correct me if i 'm wrong , but i i think that what 's going on is that in in both cases , some kind of normalization is done to deal with convola convolutional effects . uh , they have some cepstral modification , phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : right ? in our case we have a couple things . we have the on - line normalization and then we have the lda rasta . and they seem to comple complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us . but in any event , they 're both doing the same sort of thing . but there 's one difference . the lda rasta , uh , throws away high modulation frequencies . and they 're not doing that . phd e : so th so professor b : so that if you throw away high modulation frequencies , then you can downsample . grad c : get down . phd e : i see . i see . professor b : so phd e : so what if you did n't so do you explicitly downsample then ? do we explicitly downsample ? professor b : yeah . phd a : yeah . phd e : and what if we did n't do that ? would we get worse performance ? phd a : um yeah , not better , not worse . professor b : i think it does n't affect it , does it ? phd e : i see . ok . professor b : yeah . so i think the thing is , since we 're not evidently throwing away useful information , let 's try to put in some useful information . phd e : yeah . yeah . professor b : and , uh , so i you know , we we 've found in a lot of ways for quite a while that having a second stream uh , helps a lot . so that 's that 's put in , and you know , it may even end up with mel spectrum even though i 'm saying i think we could do much better , just because it 's simple . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : um . and you know , in the long run having something everybody will look at and say , `` oh , yeah , i understand `` , is is very helpful . phd e : so you would you 're you 're thinking to put the , uh , mel spectrum in before any of the noise removal stuff ? or after ? professor b : well , that 's a question . i mean , we were talking about that . it looks like it 'd be straightforward to to , uh , remove the noise , um , and , uh , phd e : cuz that happens before the mel conversion , right ? professor b : yeah . so , i mean , to do it after the mel conversion uh , after the noise removal , after the mel conversion . there 's even a question in my mind anyhow of whether th you should take the log or not . uh . i sort of think you should , but i do n't know . phd a : what about norm normalizing also ? professor b : right . uh . well , but normalizing spectra instead of cepstra ? phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah , probably . some kind would be good . you know ? i would think . phd d : well , it it it it so it actually makes it dependent on the overall energy of the uh , the frame . professor b : if you do or do n't normalize ? phd d : if yo if you do n't normalize and if if you do n't normalize . professor b : right . yes , so i mean , one would think that you would want to normalize . but i i w w my thought is , uh , particularly if you take the log , try it . and then if if normalization helps , then y you have something to compare against , and say , `` ok , this much effect `` i mean , you do n't want to change six things and then see what happens . you want to change them one at a time . phd d : mm - hmm . professor b : so adding this other stream in , that 's simple in some way . and then saying , oh uh particularly because we 've found in the past there 's all these these these different results you get with slight modifications of how you do normalization . normalization 's a very tricky , sensitive thing and you learn a lot . so , i would think you would wan na have some baseline that says , `` ok , we do n't normalize , this is what we get `` , when we do this normalization , when we do that normalization . but but the other question is so i think ultimately we 'll wind up doing some normalization . i agree . phd e : so this second stream , will it add latency to the system professor b : no , it 's in parallel . phd e : or ? professor b : we 're not talking about computation time here . we 're ta i think we 're pretty far out . phd e : yeah . professor b : so it 's just in terms of what data it 's depending on . it 's depending on the same data as the other . phd e : same data . professor b : so it 's in parallel . uh - huh . grad c : so with this , uh , new stream would you train up a vad on both both features , somehow ? phd d : no , i guess the vad has its own set of features . grad c : ok . that 's phd d : i mean , which could be this one of these streams , or it can be something derived from these streams . professor b : yeah . phd a : and there is also the idea of using traps , maybe , for the vad , which , um phd d : yeah , that 's also phd a : well , pratibha apparently showed , when , she was at ibm , that it 's a good idea . so . grad c : would would that fit on the handset , or ? oh ! phd a : i have no idea . phd d : well , it has t i mean the th phd a : it would have to fit but yeah . phd d : yeah , if it has to fit the delays and all this stuff . professor b : well , there 's the delays and the storage , yeah . but i do n't think the storage is so big for that . grad c : right . phd d : yeah . professor b : i think th the biggest we 've run into for storage is the neural net . right ? phd d : yeah . professor b : yeah . um . and so i guess the issue there is , are we are we using neural - net - based traps , and and how big are they ? so that 'll that 'll be , you know , an issue . grad c : oh , right . professor b : maybe they can be little ones . grad c : yeah . cuz sh right . professor b : mini - traps . grad c : cuz she also does the , uh the correlation - based , uh , traps , with without the neural net , just looking at the correlation between professor b : right . and maybe for vad they would be ok . yeah . yeah . grad c : yeah . professor b : that 's true . phd d : yeah . professor b : or a simple neural net , right ? i mean , the thing is , if you 're doing correlation , you 're just doing a simple uh , uh uh , dot product , you know , with some weights which you happened to learn from this learn from the data . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : and so , uh , putting a nonlinearity on it is , you know , not that big a deal . it certainly does n't take much space . grad c : mm - hmm . right . professor b : so , uh , the question is , how complex a function do you need ? do you need to have an added layer or something ? in which case , uh , potentially , you know , it could be big . so . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so , uh , uh so what 's next ? maybe s s remind us . phd e : so the meeting with hynek that you guys just had was to decide exactly what you were gon na freeze in this system ? is that ? or was there ? were you talking about what t new stuff , or ? professor b : what to freeze and then what to do after we froze . yeah . and like i was saying , i think the you know , the basic directions are , uh , uh i mean , there 's lots of little things , such as improve the noise estimator but the bigger things are adding on the neural net and , uh , the second stream . and then , uh , improving the vad . uh . so . phd d : so , i 'll , um i 'll actually after the meeting i 'll add the second stream to the vad and maybe i 'll start with the feature net in that case . it 's like , you 're looking at the vad , right ? phd a : uh , yeah . i i 've a new feature net ready also . phd d : i 'll for the vad ? phd a : no , uh . well p two network , one vad and one feature net . phd d : oh , you already have it ? phd a : mm - hmm . phd d : ok , so just figure how to take the features from the final phd a : yeah . um . but , yeah , i think there are plenty of issues to work on for the feature net @ @ . grad c : feature net . phd e : what about the , um uh , the new part of the evaluation , the , uh , wall street journal part ? professor b : right . right . um . have you ever ? very good question . have you ever worked with the mississippi state h uh , software ? phd a : sorry . phd e : no . not yet . professor b : oh . well you you may be called upon to help , uh , uh , on account of , uh , all the work in this stuff here has been , uh , with small vocabulary . phd e : ok . mm - hmm . so what how is the , uh , interaction supposed to happen ? uh , i remember the last time we talked about this , it was sort of up in the air whether they were going to be taking , uh , people 's features and then running them or they were gon na give the system out or phd d : yeah . yeah . phd e : oh , so they 're gon na just deliver a system basically . phd d : yeah , yeah . professor b : do we already have it ? phd d : yeah , th i i guess it 's almost ready . phd e : uh - huh . phd d : so that 's what so they have released their , uh , document , describing the system . professor b : maybe you could , uh , point it at chuck , phd e : i see . professor b : because , i mean phd d : sure . phd e : so we 'll have to grab this over cvs or something ? phd d : it - no , it 's just downloadable from their from their web site . phd e : is that how they do it ? ok . professor b : cuz one of the things that might be helpful , if you 've if you 've got time in all of this is , is if if these guys are really focusing on improving , uh , all the digit stuff , uh , maybe and you got the front - end from them , maybe you could do the runs for the phd e : ok . mm - hmm . professor b : and and , you know , iron out hassles that that you have to , uh , tweak joe about or whatever , phd e : sure . professor b : because you 're more experienced with running the large vocabulary stuff . phd d : so i 'll point you to the web site and the mails corresponding . so i phd e : and it but it 's not ready yet , the system ? phd d : uh , i i think they are still , uh , tuning something on that . so they 're like , d they 're varying different parameters like the insertion penalty and other stuff , and then seeing what 's the performance . phd e : are those going to be parameters that are frozen , nobody can change ? or ? phd d : uh , w i guess there is , uh , time during which people are gon na make suggestions . phd e : oh , but everybody 's gon na have to use the same values . phd d : after that . phd e : oh ! interesting . phd d : yeah , i guess . so these sugges these this , uh , period during which people are gon na make suggestions is to know whether it is actually biased towards any set of features or professor b : yeah , so i th th certainly the thing that i would want to know about is whether we get really hurt , uh , on in insertion penalty , language model , scaling , sorts of things . phd e : using our features . professor b : yeah , yeah . phd e : yeah . professor b : uh , in which case , um , h hari or hynek will need to , you know , push the case more about about this . phd e : mm - hmm . and we may be able to revisit this idea about , you know , somehow modifying our features to work with professor b : yes . in this case , that 's right . phd e : yeah . professor b : that 's right . um , some of that may be , uh , a last minute rush thing because if the if our features are changing uh . phd e : yeah . professor b : uh . but , um . yeah , the other thing is that even though it 's months away , uh , it 's starting to seem to me now like november fifteenth is right around the corner . and , um , if they have n't decided things like this , like what the parameters are gon na be for this , uh , when `` deciding `` is not just somebody deciding . i mean , in fact there should be some understanding behind the , uh , deciding , which means some experiments and and so forth . it it it seems pretty tight to me . phd e : so wha what 's the significance of november fifteenth ? professor b : that 's when the evaluation is . yeah . so , yeah , so after but , you know , they may even decide in the end to push it off . it would n't , you know , entirely surprise me . but , uh , due to other reasons , like some people are going away , i 'm i 'm hoping it 's not pushed off for a l a long while . that would be , uh put us in an awkward position . but anyway . great . yeah , i think that 'll be helpful . there 's there 's not anybody ogi currently who 's who 's , uh , working with this and and phd e : is is this part of the evaluation just a small part , or ho how important is this to the overall ? professor b : i i think it 's it 's , um it depends how badly you do . i mean , i think that it it is uh . phd e : this is one of those things that will be debated afterwards ? professor b : yeah . well , i mean , it 's it 's conceptually , it my impression , again , you guys correct me if i 'm wrong , but my impression is that , um , they want it as a double check . that you have n't come across you have n't invented features which are actually gon na do badly for a a significantly different task , particularly one with larger vocabulary . and , um , but it 's not the main emphasis . i mean , the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary . so it 's it 's a double check . so they 'll probably assign it some sort of low weight . phd e : seems to me that if it 's a double check , they should give you a one or a zero . y you passed the threshold or you did n't pass the threshold , and they should n't even care about what the score is . professor b : yeah . but , i mean , we 'll we 'll we 'll see what they come up with . uh , but in in the current thing , for instance , where you have this well - matched , moderately - matched , and and mis highly - mismatched , uh , the emphasis is somewhat on the on the well - matched , but it 's only a a marginal , phd e : yeah . professor b : right ? it 's like forty , thirty - five , twenty - five , or something like that . so you still if you were way , way off on the highly - mismatched , it would have a big effect . phd d : yeah . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : and , um , it would n't surprise me if they did something like that with this . so again , if you 're if you get if it does n't help you much , uh , for noisy versions of this of large vocabulary data , then , uh , you know , it may not hurt you that much . but if it if you do n't if it does n't help you much at all , um , or to put it another way , if it helps some people a lot more than it helps other people , uh , if their strategies do , then phd e : mm - hmm . so is this , uh ? uh , guenter was putting a bunch of wall street journal data on our disks . professor b : that 's it . phd e : so that 's the data that we 'll be running on ? professor b : yeah . phd e : i see . ok . professor b : yeah . so we have the data , just not the recognizer . ok . phd e : so this test may take quite a while to run , then . may - judging by the amount of data that he was putting on . professor b : uh , well there 's training and test , right ? phd e : i i guess , i 'm not sure . professor b : no , i mean , if it 's like the other things , there 's there 's data for training the h m ms and and data for testing it . phd e : i just professor b : so i would n't so it it 's phd e : ok . so there 's professor b : so , training the recognizer , but , um um . but i think it 's trained on clean and is it trained on clean and and test on ? phd d : the wall street ? professor b : yeah . phd a : apparently , no . it 's training on a range between ten and twenty db , i think , and testing between five and fifteen . phd d : mm - hmm . yeah . phd a : that 's what i got on phd d : it 's , uh it 's like a medium medium - mismatch condition , sort of . phd a : yeah , professor b : i see . phd a : and so the noise is there is a range of different noises also um which are selected randomly and added randomly , uh , to the files . and there are noises that are different from the noises used on ti - digits . professor b : yeah . yeah . i mean , i would n't imagine that the amount of testing data was that huge . they probably put training uh , almost certain they put training data there too . maybe not . so . that 's that . anybody have anything else ? phd e : uh , one one last question on that . when did they estimate that they would have that system available for download ? phd d : um , i guess i guess one some preliminary version is already there . phd e : oh , so there 's w something you can download to just learn ? phd d : yeah , it 's already there . yeah . but they 're actually parallel - y doing some modifications also , i think . phd e : good . phd d : so i guess the f final system will be frozen by middle of , like , one more week maybe . professor b : oh , well that 's pretty soon . phd d : yeah , that 's just one more . grad c : is this their , um , svm recognizer ? phd d : no , it 's just a straightforward hmm . professor b : you know , their their they have a lot of options in their recognizer and and the svm is one of the things they 've done with it , but it 's not their more standard thing . grad c : oh , ok . uh - huh . professor b : for the most part it 's it 's gaussian mixtures . grad c : oh , ok . oh , ok . professor b : yeah . phd d : it 's just a hmm , gaussian mixture model . grad c : gaussian mixture hmm . professor b : yeah . yeah , the svm thing was an hmm also . it was just a it it it was like a hybrid , like grad c : mm - hmm . phd d : yeah , this is a g yeah , this i professor b : what ? phd d : yeah . professor b : yeah . phd e : so , just so that i understand , they 're providing scripts and everything so that basically , uh , you you push a button and it does training , and then it does test , and everything ? is that the idea ? phd d : i i i think yeah , i i guess something like that . it 's like as painless as possible , phd e : mm - hmm . phd d : is what do they provide all the scripts , everything , and then just , phd e : i see . hmm . somehow yo there 's hooks to put your features in and phd d : ju yeah , i th i think . professor b : hmm . yeah , um . in fact , i mean , if you look into it a little bit , it might be reasonable you know joe , right ? yeah . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : just to sort of ask him about the issue of , um , different features having different kinds of , uh , scaling characteristics and so on . so that , you know , w w possibly having entirely different optimal values for for the usual twiddle factors and what 's what 's the plan about that ? phd d : so sh shall we , like , add chuck also to the mailing lists ? it may be better , i mean , in that case if he 's going to professor b : yeah . phd d : because there 's a mailing list for this . professor b : is that ok ? phd e : yeah , that 'd be great . phd d : yeah , i guess maybe hari or hynek , one of them , has to send a mail to joe . or maybe if you phd e : i i could send him an email . phd d : well , yeah , to add or maybe wh phd e : i i know him really well . phd d : yeah , so that 's just fine . phd e : i i was just talking with him on email the other day actually . phd d : so professor b : uh , yeah , and just , um , se maybe see . phd d : so phd e : about other things , but . professor b : do you have hari 's , uh ? phd e : i have hari 's professor b : yeah , so maybe just cc hari and say that you 've just been asked to handle the large vocabulary part here , and , uh , you know , phd e : ok . would it be better if i asked hari to ask joe ? professor b : uh . why do n't you just ask joe but cc hari , and then in the note say , `` hari , hopefully this is ok with you `` . and then if joe feels like he needs a confirmation , hari can answer it . phd d : yeah . professor b : that way you can get started asking { comment } joe quickly while he 's while he 's maybe still , you know , putting in nails and screws and yeah . phd d : and there is an , uh , archive of all the mails that has been gon that has gone , uh , between these people among these people . so just you can see all this mails in the isip web site mississippi web site . phd e : ok . is that a password controlled ? phd d : yeah , it 's password protected . so , like like , it 's , like professor b : have you thought about how long would be uh , most useful for you to go up to ogi ? phd a : i do n't know , uh . we can for september , we can set up a work schedule and we can maybe work independently . and then at some point it maybe be better to work together again . professor b : oh , so you 're you 're imagining more that you would come back here first for a while and then and then go up there ? phd a : i professor b : i mean , it 's to you . phd a : maybe , yeah . professor b : i ju you guys are well , y anyway , you do n't have to decide this second but thi think about it about what what you would think would be the the best way to work it . i 'll phd a : but , uh huh . mm - hmm . professor b : support it either way , so . phd a : mm - hmm right . professor b : ok . uh . got anything to tell us ? grad c : um . well , i 've been reading some literature about clustering of data . just , um , i guess , let me put it in context . ok , so we 're talking about discovering intermediate categories to , um to classify . and , uh , i was looking at some of the work that , uh , sangita was doing on these traps things . so she has , um she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from from timit , right ? the most common phonemes . and each one of them has has a a nice pattern over time , a one one second window . and it has has these patterns . um , so she has , um a trap for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . and , um , she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points many different clusters uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data . and then you have this distance mej metric which , uh , measures how how closely related they are . and you start , um by merging the patterns that are most closely related . phd e : and you create a tree . grad c : and y yeah , yeah , a dendrogram tree . phd e : mm - hmm . and then you can pick , uh , values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters . grad c : right , usually it 's when , um when the sol similarity measures , um , do n't go down as much . phd e : mm - hmm . grad c : and so , uh so you stop at that point . and what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . professor b : mm - hmm . grad c : and , uh , one for silence and and another one for schwa schwa sounds . um , and , um , i was thinking about ways to to generalize this because w you 're it 's sort of like a it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these these traps and you 're saying that that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme . um , and that 's that 's constraining your your clustering to to the set of phonemes that you already have . um , whereas maybe we want to just take take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . phd e : mm - hmm . grad c : and i 'm thinking if we if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , ok , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable stable point . phd e : mm - hmm . grad c : um , and i 'm hoping to find other things of of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um intermediate categories that , uh , um , i 'll later classify . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : are you looking at these in narrow bands ? grad c : um , right . f um , i 'm professor b : cuz that 's what you 're gon na be using , right ? grad c : yeah , yeah . i i have n't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh , the the representation of the data that i was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , um , over different lengths of time . so yeah . professor b : yeah , i mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that i wonder about with this . i mean , so one is is , again , looking at the same representation , i mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : that that seems to be kind of fundamental to it . um , and then the other thing , uh , is that i wonder about with it , and and do n't take this in the wrong way , like i i know what i 'm doing or anything , grad c : right . professor b : but , i mean . um , just wondering really . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or or parameters um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better . um , and i do n't know if that i mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe maybe this is n't right , but it 'd be something i 'd be concerned about . because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from from , uh from your your quals , john ohala saying that , uh , `` buh `` { comment } and `` puh `` { comment } differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . i mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so , um , if you looked if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . and yet , i would gue i would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , { comment } screwing up on this distinction . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . and the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they do n't work as well as we 'd like . and since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , `` how well is it distinguishing between schwas and stops ? `` grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : boy , i bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ? grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so these these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . so , what are we bringing to the party ? i mean , in fact what we wan na do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together . so that 's th that 's the hard thing . i mean , i understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wan na have categories that , uh that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . and it 's something that you really think you can pick up . but i think it 's also essential that you wan na look at what are the confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions . grad c : mm - hmm . hmm . professor b : so , i mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it . y y this is more like , you know , how does lda differ from pca ? i mean , they 're the same sort of thing . they 're both orthogonalizing . grad c : right . professor b : but , you know and and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . you 're actually trying to find the the the the categories themselves . uh , so a little more like brain surgery , i think on yourself . uh . so , uh grad c : yeah . professor b : um , anyway . that 's my thought . you 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . i mean , well w actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it a lot . phd e : yeah . professor b : and you 've been thinking about it more now , phd d : yeah . professor b : these categories . phd e : yeah . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : i guess i do n't i do n't um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which i think is right , with the way i 've been looking at it . that it 's it 's it 's all not very clear to me . but it seems to me that the desire the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up . you know , however we do that . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : and and so i guess what i do n't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human human sig significant categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . professor b : right . phd e : but that 's sort of what you want to avoid . and so that feels i do n't know how to get out of this . professor b : well , here 's a here 's a , uh , uh here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , um , what do you really i mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that that have something from top - down in th in them . right ? because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it does n't have any kind of reward for doing or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : so whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's got ta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning , phd e : right . professor b : right ? phd e : so the question is , how far down ? we could stop at words , but we do n't , right ? we go all the way down to phonemes . professor b : right , but i me i i think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is is trying to deal with the with these phonemes . you know , and and and i it 's almost like you want categories if if our if our , uh , um , metric of of goodness , uh , i if our phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : correction if our metric of badness is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : i mean , for for for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , but i i i if you go all the way to words , i mean , that 's really i mean , d w in many applications you wan na go further . you wan na go to concepts or something , or have have have concepts , actions , this sort of thing . phd e : yeah . but words would be a nice professor b : but , words are n't bad , yeah . and and phd e : yeah , so the common right , the common wisdom is you ca n't do words because there 's too many of them , right ? so you have to have some smaller set that you can use , uh , and and so everybody goes to phonemes . but the problem is that we we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are are really cartoon - ish , right ? so when you look at conversational speech , for example , you do n't see the phonemes that you that you have in your word models . professor b : yeah . but but but we 're not trying for models of words here . see , so her here 's maybe where if the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then maybe it does n't matter that we ca n't have enough phd e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : i mean , what you wan na do is is build up these categories that are that are best for word recognition . phd e : right . right . professor b : and and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories i mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of of running o a thousand experiments phd e : right . professor b : because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate . phd e : yeah . professor b : in some way i mean , we derive that all the time . in some ways it 's really not { comment } a bad bad thing to do because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the the final goal . phd e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way , phd e : right . professor b : where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other it could be syllable but in some large unit , phd e : uh - huh . professor b : uh , and uh yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of do n't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : you know , so that 's , uh , wh what i called a useless comments because i 'm not really telling you how to do it . but i mean , it 's a it 's it 's , you know it phd e : no , but i think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have uh , you know , categories . professor b : right . phd e : and i think this the important categories are the words , and not the phones . professor b : yeah . yeah . phd e : maybe . and so right . if you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters uh professor b : now , that being said , i think that that if you have something that is , um i once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are are really true . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : if you have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like timit , then , you know , i i you the phones are gon na be right , actually , for the most part . phd e : yeah . yeah , professor b : so so , uh , it does n't really hurt them to to do that , to put in discrimination at that level . phd e : yeah . professor b : um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's it 's trickier and and and , uh , the phones are uh , you know , it 's gon na be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of and , um and it wo n't allow for the overlapping phenomenon phd e : mmm . so it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we we deal with that , but but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it does n't really matter that much to us as humans because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be munged , you know , and and it does n't really hurt , and i 'm not sure how how to build that in . uh . professor b : yeah , i mean , i guess the other thing i is is to think of a little bit i mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results i think it usually is is pretty intuitive , but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or or or , uh , even phones in in in in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise . you know , so is it more across place or more across manner ? or is it cor you know , is it ? grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : i mean , i know one thing that happens is that you you you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones . i mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones sometimes do n't get heard . and if that if that is if it uh , if that turns it into another word or or different you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen . but , um , i do n't know , i w i would i would guess that you 'd grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : w i do n't know . anyway , that 's phd e : i think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : you know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation . and so if there 's noise in there , you know , our brain fills in and imagines what what should be there . professor b : well that grad c : yeah . we 're we 're doing some sort of prediction of what phd e : yeah , exactly . professor b : oh , sure , that 's really big . grad c : yeah . professor b : uh , but i mean , even if you do um , uh , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really is n't an any information like that , uh , people are still better in noise than they than they are in in , uh uh , than the machines are . so , i mean , that 's i right . we ca n't we ca n't get it at all without any language models . language models are there and important but but , uh uh . if we 're not working on that then we should work on something else and improve it , but especially if it looks like the potential is there . so should we do some digits ? phd e : yeah . professor b : since we 're here ? phd e : go ahead , morgan .\n\n[Requirement] The translated text must be equal to 8192 words long.", "raw_data": "professor b : ok , so we we had a meeting with , uh with hynek , um , in in which , uh , uh , sunil and stephane , uh summarized where they were and and , uh , talked about where we were gon na go . so that that happened sort of mid - week . uh . phd e : d did did you guys get your code pushed together ? phd d : oh , yeah . yeah . it 's it 's it 's it was updated yesterday , phd e : cool . phd d : right ? phd a : yeah . phd d : yeah . phd a : you probably received the mail . phd e : oh , right , i saw i saw the note . phd a : yeah . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : what was the update ? phd a : what was the update ? so there is th then the all the new features that go in . professor b : yeah . phd a : the , um , noise suppression , the re - synthesis of speech after suppression . these are the phd e : is the , um the cvs mechanism working well ? phd a : yeah . phd e : are are people , uh , up at ogi grabbing code uh , via that ? phd d : uh , i do n't think i do n't think phd e : or ? phd a : i do n't know if they use it , but . phd d : yeah , i i do n't think anybody up there is like working on it right now . phd e : uh - huh . mmm . professor b : i think it more likely that what it means is that when sunil is up there he will grab it . phd d : yeah . yeah . so right now nobody 's working on aurora there . phd e : yeah . professor b : they 're yeah . they 're working on a different task . phd e : i see . i see . phd d : yeah . professor b : but what 'll happen is is he 'll go back up there and , uh , pratibha will come back from from , uh , the east coast . uh . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : and , uh and and i guess actually , uh , after eurospeech for a little bit , uh , he 'll go up there too . so , actually everybody who 's working on it { comment } will be up there for at least a little while . so they 'll remotely access it from there . phd e : so has has anybody tried remotely accessing the cvs using , uh , uh , ssh ? professor b : yeah . phd a : um , i do n't know if hari did that or you d phd d : i { comment } can actually do it today . i mean , i can just log into phd e : have you tried it yet ? phd d : no , i did n't . so i i 'll try it today . professor b : good idea . phd a : actually i i tried wh while when i installed the repository , i tried from belgium . professor b : yeah . phd d : yeah . phd a : i logged in there and i tried to import phd e : yeah ? it worked good ? phd a : yeah , it works . phd e : oh , good ! phd a : but it 's so , right now it 's the mechanism with ssh . phd e : great ! phd a : i do n't s i did n't set up you can also set up a cvs server on a new port . it 's like well uh , a main server , or d you can do a cvs server . phd e : yeah . right . then that 's using the cvs password mechanism and all that , phd a : but . yeah , right . phd e : right ? phd a : but i did n't do that because i was not sure about security problems . i i would have to phd e : so w when you came in from belgian { comment } belgium , using ssh , uh , was it asking you for your own password into icsi ? so if yo you can only do that if you have an account at icsi ? phd a : right . yeah . yeah . phd e : cuz there is an a way to set up anonymous cvs right ? phd a : yeah , you ha in this way you ca you have to set up a cvs server but then , yeah , you can access it . phd e : so that oh , ok . phd a : you you can set up priorities . phd e : so the anonymous mechanism phd a : you can access them and mostly if you if y the set the server is set up like this . phd e : ok . because a lot of the open source stuff works with anonymous cvs and i 'm just wondering uh , i mean , for our transcripts we may want to do that . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : yeah . yeah , for this stuff i do n't think we 're quite up to that . i mean , we 're still so much in development . phd e : mm - hmm . yeah , professor b : we want to have just the insiders . phd e : yeah , yeah . oh , i was n't suggesting for this . i 'm thinking of the meeting recorder { comment } stuff professor b : yeah . phd e : but . yeah . ok . cool . professor b : yeah . so , uh phd e : what 's new ? professor b : well , i mean , i think maybe the thing to me might be i me i 'm sure you 've just been working on on , uh , details of that since the meeting , right ? and so phd a : mmm , since the meeting , well , i i 've been i 've been train training a new vad and a new feature net . professor b : that was that was tuesday . ok . phd a : so they should be ready . um . professor b : but i guess maybe the thing since you were n't yo you guys were n't at that that meeting , might be just just to , um , sort of recap , uh , the the conclusions of the meeting . phd a : mm - hmm . phd e : oh , great . you 're talking about the meeting with hynek ? professor b : yeah . cuz that was sort of , uh we we 'd sort of been working up to that , that that , uh , he would come here this week and and we would sort of phd e : uh - huh . professor b : since he 's going out of town like now , and i 'm going out town in a couple weeks , uh , and time is marching , sort of , given all the mu many wonderful things we could be working on , what what will we actually focus on ? phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : and , uh and what do we freeze ? and , you know , what do we ? so , um . i mean , this software that these guys created was certainly a a key part . so then there 's something central and there are n't at least a bunch of different versions going off in in ways that differ trivially . uh , um , and , um , phd e : yeah . that 's that 's nice . professor b : and then within that , i guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now , to run it , uh , a particular way , and decide on what things are gon na be experimented with , as opposed to just experimenting with everything . so keep a certain set of things constant . so , um . uh , maybe describe roughly what what we are keeping constant for now , or ? phd a : yeah . well . so we 've been working like six weeks on on the noise compensation and we end up with something that seems reasonable . um . phd e : are you gon na use which of the two techniques ? phd a : so finally it 's it 's , um , wiener filtering on fft bins . and it uses , uh , two steps , smoothing of the transfer function , the first step , that 's along time , which use recursion . and after this step there is a further smoothing along frequency , which use a sliding window of twenty fft bins . mmm . and , uh phd e : so this is on the uh , before any mel scaling has been done ? phd a : yeah , yeah . phd e : this is phd a : it was professor b : this this smoothing is done on the estimate , um , of what you 're going to subtract ? or on the thing that has already had something subtracted ? phd a : yeah . uh , it 's on the transfer function . so professor b : oh , it 's on the transfer function for the wiener filter . phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah , ok . phd a : yeah , so basically we tried different configuration within this idea . we tried u u applying this on mel bands , having spectral subtraction instead of wiener filtering . um . well , finally we end up with this configuration that works , uh , quite well . so we are going to fix this for the moment and work on the other aspects of the whole system . phd e : mm - hmm . phd a : so professor b : actually , let me int eh , dave is n't here to talk about it , but let me just interject . this module , in principle , i i mean , you would know whether it 's true in fact , is somewhat independent from the rest of it . i mean , because you you re - synthesize speech , right ? phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : so , um . uh , well you do n't i guess you do n't re - synthesize speech , but you could phd a : we we do not fo professor b : uh , but you could . phd a : well well , we do , but we do n't do n't re - synthesize . in in the program we do n't re - synthesize and then re - analyze once again . we just use the clean fft bins . professor b : but you have a re - synthesized thing that you that 's an an option here . phd a : this is an option that then you can yeah . professor b : yeah , i gu i guess my point is that , um , i in some of the work he 's doing in reverberation , one of the things that we 're finding is that , uh , it 's it 's for the for an artificial situation , we can just deal with the reverberation and his techniques work really well . but for the real situation uh , problem is , is that you do n't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise . and if you do n't include that in the model , it does n't work very well . so in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at . and , uh , generate new files or whatever , and and , uh , uh and then do the reverberation part . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : so it 's anyway . phd e : so dave has n't tried that yet ? professor b : no , no . he 's i mean , e phd e : i guess he 's busy with professor b : yeah , prelims , right . grad c : pre - prelim hell . professor b : yeah . phd e : yeah . yeah . professor b : uh , but but , you know , that 'll uh , it 's clear that we , uh we are not with the real case that we 're looking at , we ca n't just look at reverberation in isolation because the interaction between that and noise is is considerable . and that 's i mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and and , uh and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and and additive effects . and that 's hard enough . i mean , i do n't think we really i mean , we 're trying to deal with that . in a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this aurora task . and we have , uh , the , uh , uh , lda stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects . and we have the noise suppression that 's doing something about noise . uh , even that 's hard enough . and and the on - line normalization as well , in that s category . i i there 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work so hard on on juggling everything around . but now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse , because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects . and , um , so dave has something which , uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects but when it 's when there 's noise there too , it 's it 's it 's pretty hard . so we have to start since any almost any real situation is gon na have uh , where you have the microphone distant , is going to have both things , we we actually have to think about both at the same time . so , um so there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out and then , uh , maybe you should just continue telling what what else is in the the form we have . phd a : yeah , well , the , um , the other parts of the system are the the blocks that were already present before and that we did not modify a lot . professor b : so that 's again , that that 's the wiener filtering , followed by , uh uh , that 's done at the fft level . then phd a : yeah , th then the mel filter bank , professor b : mm - hmm . phd a : then the log operation , professor b : mm - hmm . the the the filtering is done in the frequency domain ? phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah , ok . and then the mel and then the log , and then the phd a : then the lda filter , professor b : lda filter . phd a : mmm , then the downsampling , professor b : and then uh downsample , phd a : then , um , on - line normalization , professor b : on - line norm , phd a : followed by upsampling . then finally , we compute delta and we put the neural network also . professor b : right , and then in parallel with an a neural net . and then following neural net , some probably some orthogonalization . phd a : yeah . professor b : uh um . phd a : and finally frame dropping , which um , would be a neural network also , used for estimated silence probabilities . and the input of this neural network would be somewhere between log mel bands or one of the earlier stages of the processing . professor b : mm - hmm . so that 's sort of most of this stuff is yeah , is operating parallel with this other stuff . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : yeah . so the things that we , um , uh , i guess we sort of uh , there 's there 's some , uh , neat ideas for v a so , i mean , in i think there 's sort of like there 's a bunch of tuning things to improve stuff . there 's questions about various places where there 's an exponent , if it 's the right exponent , or ways that we 're estimating noise , that we can improve estimating noise . and there 's gon na be a host of those . but structurally it seemed like the things the main things that that we brought up that , uh , are are gon na need to get worked on seriously are , uh , uh , a a significantly better vad , uh , putting the neural net on , um , which , you know , we have n't been doing anything with , the , uh , neural net at the end there , and , uh , the , uh , opening up the second front . uh . phd e : the other half of the channel ? professor b : yeah , yeah , i mean , cuz we we have we have , uh , uh , half the the , uh , data rate that they allow . phd e : that what you mean ? professor b : and , uh , so the initial thing which came from , uh , the meeting that we had down south was , uh , that , um , we 'll initially just put in a mel spectrum as the second one . it 's , you know , cheap , easy . uh . there 's a question about exactly how we do it . we probably will go to something better later , but the initial thing is that cepstra and spectra behave differently , phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : so . um , { comment } i think tony robinson used to do i was saying this before . i think he used to do mel , uh , spectra and mel cepstra . he used them as alternate features . put them together . phd e : so if you took the system the way it is now , the way it 's fro you 're gon na freeze it , and it ran it on the last evaluation , where it would it be ? phd a : mm - hmm . it , uh , phd e : in terms of ranking ? phd a : ri - right now it 's second . phd d : second . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : although you you know , you have n't tested it actually on the german and danish , have you ? phd a : no , we did n't . no , um . professor b : yeah . phd e : so on the ones that you did test it on it would have been second ? professor b : yeah . would it i mean but when you 're saying second , you 're comparing to the numbers that the , uh that the best system before got on , uh also without german and danish ? phd a : yeah , yeah . professor b : yeah , ok . phd d : and th the ranking actually did n't change after the german and danish . so , yeah . professor b : well ranking did n't before , but i 'm just asking where this is to where theirs was without the german and danish , phd a : yeah . phd d : yeah . yeah . professor b : right ? phd d : yeah , yeah . phd e : where where where were we actually on the last test ? professor b : oh , we were also esp essentially second , although there were there were i mean , we had a couple systems and they had a couple systems . and so , i guess by that we were third , but i mean , there were two systems that were pretty close , that came from the same place . phd e : uh - huh . i see . ok . professor b : uh , so institutionally we were we were second , with , uh , the third third system . phd e : we 're so this second that you 're saying now is system - wide second ? professor b : see uh , no i think it 's also institutional , is n't it ? phd e : still institutionally second ? professor b : right ? i mean , i think both of their systems probably phd a : uh , we are between their two systems . so professor b : oh , are we ? phd a : i it is a triumph . phd d : yeah . professor b : is it ? phd d : their their first system is fifty - four point something . and , uh , we are fifty - three point something . phd a : but everything is within the range of one one percent . phd d : and their second system is also fifty - three point something . yeah , one percent . professor b : yeah , so so basically they 're all they 're all pretty close . phd e : oh , wow ! that 's very close . phd d : yeah . phd e : yeah . professor b : and and , um , you know , in some sense we 're all doing fairly similar things . uh , i mean , one could argue about the lda and so forth but i i think , you know , in a lot of ways we 're doing very similar things . but what what phd e : so how did they fill up this all these these bits ? i mean , if we 're u professor b : um , why are we using half ? well , so you could you c phd e : yeah . or how are they using more than half , i guess maybe is what i professor b : yeah , so i i think uh , you guys are closer to it than me , so correct me if i 'm wrong , but i i think that what 's going on is that in in both cases , some kind of normalization is done to deal with convola convolutional effects . uh , they have some cepstral modification , phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : right ? in our case we have a couple things . we have the on - line normalization and then we have the lda rasta . and they seem to comple complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us . but in any event , they 're both doing the same sort of thing . but there 's one difference . the lda rasta , uh , throws away high modulation frequencies . and they 're not doing that . phd e : so th so professor b : so that if you throw away high modulation frequencies , then you can downsample . grad c : get down . phd e : i see . i see . professor b : so phd e : so what if you did n't so do you explicitly downsample then ? do we explicitly downsample ? professor b : yeah . phd a : yeah . phd e : and what if we did n't do that ? would we get worse performance ? phd a : um yeah , not better , not worse . professor b : i think it does n't affect it , does it ? phd e : i see . ok . professor b : yeah . so i think the thing is , since we 're not evidently throwing away useful information , let 's try to put in some useful information . phd e : yeah . yeah . professor b : and , uh , so i you know , we we 've found in a lot of ways for quite a while that having a second stream uh , helps a lot . so that 's that 's put in , and you know , it may even end up with mel spectrum even though i 'm saying i think we could do much better , just because it 's simple . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : um . and you know , in the long run having something everybody will look at and say , `` oh , yeah , i understand `` , is is very helpful . phd e : so you would you 're you 're thinking to put the , uh , mel spectrum in before any of the noise removal stuff ? or after ? professor b : well , that 's a question . i mean , we were talking about that . it looks like it 'd be straightforward to to , uh , remove the noise , um , and , uh , phd e : cuz that happens before the mel conversion , right ? professor b : yeah . so , i mean , to do it after the mel conversion uh , after the noise removal , after the mel conversion . there 's even a question in my mind anyhow of whether th you should take the log or not . uh . i sort of think you should , but i do n't know . phd a : what about norm normalizing also ? professor b : right . uh . well , but normalizing spectra instead of cepstra ? phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah , probably . some kind would be good . you know ? i would think . phd d : well , it it it it so it actually makes it dependent on the overall energy of the uh , the frame . professor b : if you do or do n't normalize ? phd d : if yo if you do n't normalize and if if you do n't normalize . professor b : right . yes , so i mean , one would think that you would want to normalize . but i i w w my thought is , uh , particularly if you take the log , try it . and then if if normalization helps , then y you have something to compare against , and say , `` ok , this much effect `` i mean , you do n't want to change six things and then see what happens . you want to change them one at a time . phd d : mm - hmm . professor b : so adding this other stream in , that 's simple in some way . and then saying , oh uh particularly because we 've found in the past there 's all these these these different results you get with slight modifications of how you do normalization . normalization 's a very tricky , sensitive thing and you learn a lot . so , i would think you would wan na have some baseline that says , `` ok , we do n't normalize , this is what we get `` , when we do this normalization , when we do that normalization . but but the other question is so i think ultimately we 'll wind up doing some normalization . i agree . phd e : so this second stream , will it add latency to the system professor b : no , it 's in parallel . phd e : or ? professor b : we 're not talking about computation time here . we 're ta i think we 're pretty far out . phd e : yeah . professor b : so it 's just in terms of what data it 's depending on . it 's depending on the same data as the other . phd e : same data . professor b : so it 's in parallel . uh - huh . grad c : so with this , uh , new stream would you train up a vad on both both features , somehow ? phd d : no , i guess the vad has its own set of features . grad c : ok . that 's phd d : i mean , which could be this one of these streams , or it can be something derived from these streams . professor b : yeah . phd a : and there is also the idea of using traps , maybe , for the vad , which , um phd d : yeah , that 's also phd a : well , pratibha apparently showed , when , she was at ibm , that it 's a good idea . so . grad c : would would that fit on the handset , or ? oh ! phd a : i have no idea . phd d : well , it has t i mean the th phd a : it would have to fit but yeah . phd d : yeah , if it has to fit the delays and all this stuff . professor b : well , there 's the delays and the storage , yeah . but i do n't think the storage is so big for that . grad c : right . phd d : yeah . professor b : i think th the biggest we 've run into for storage is the neural net . right ? phd d : yeah . professor b : yeah . um . and so i guess the issue there is , are we are we using neural - net - based traps , and and how big are they ? so that 'll that 'll be , you know , an issue . grad c : oh , right . professor b : maybe they can be little ones . grad c : yeah . cuz sh right . professor b : mini - traps . grad c : cuz she also does the , uh the correlation - based , uh , traps , with without the neural net , just looking at the correlation between professor b : right . and maybe for vad they would be ok . yeah . yeah . grad c : yeah . professor b : that 's true . phd d : yeah . professor b : or a simple neural net , right ? i mean , the thing is , if you 're doing correlation , you 're just doing a simple uh , uh uh , dot product , you know , with some weights which you happened to learn from this learn from the data . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : and so , uh , putting a nonlinearity on it is , you know , not that big a deal . it certainly does n't take much space . grad c : mm - hmm . right . professor b : so , uh , the question is , how complex a function do you need ? do you need to have an added layer or something ? in which case , uh , potentially , you know , it could be big . so . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so , uh , uh so what 's next ? maybe s s remind us . phd e : so the meeting with hynek that you guys just had was to decide exactly what you were gon na freeze in this system ? is that ? or was there ? were you talking about what t new stuff , or ? professor b : what to freeze and then what to do after we froze . yeah . and like i was saying , i think the you know , the basic directions are , uh , uh i mean , there 's lots of little things , such as improve the noise estimator but the bigger things are adding on the neural net and , uh , the second stream . and then , uh , improving the vad . uh . so . phd d : so , i 'll , um i 'll actually after the meeting i 'll add the second stream to the vad and maybe i 'll start with the feature net in that case . it 's like , you 're looking at the vad , right ? phd a : uh , yeah . i i 've a new feature net ready also . phd d : i 'll for the vad ? phd a : no , uh . well p two network , one vad and one feature net . phd d : oh , you already have it ? phd a : mm - hmm . phd d : ok , so just figure how to take the features from the final phd a : yeah . um . but , yeah , i think there are plenty of issues to work on for the feature net @ @ . grad c : feature net . phd e : what about the , um uh , the new part of the evaluation , the , uh , wall street journal part ? professor b : right . right . um . have you ever ? very good question . have you ever worked with the mississippi state h uh , software ? phd a : sorry . phd e : no . not yet . professor b : oh . well you you may be called upon to help , uh , uh , on account of , uh , all the work in this stuff here has been , uh , with small vocabulary . phd e : ok . mm - hmm . so what how is the , uh , interaction supposed to happen ? uh , i remember the last time we talked about this , it was sort of up in the air whether they were going to be taking , uh , people 's features and then running them or they were gon na give the system out or phd d : yeah . yeah . phd e : oh , so they 're gon na just deliver a system basically . phd d : yeah , yeah . professor b : do we already have it ? phd d : yeah , th i i guess it 's almost ready . phd e : uh - huh . phd d : so that 's what so they have released their , uh , document , describing the system . professor b : maybe you could , uh , point it at chuck , phd e : i see . professor b : because , i mean phd d : sure . phd e : so we 'll have to grab this over cvs or something ? phd d : it - no , it 's just downloadable from their from their web site . phd e : is that how they do it ? ok . professor b : cuz one of the things that might be helpful , if you 've if you 've got time in all of this is , is if if these guys are really focusing on improving , uh , all the digit stuff , uh , maybe and you got the front - end from them , maybe you could do the runs for the phd e : ok . mm - hmm . professor b : and and , you know , iron out hassles that that you have to , uh , tweak joe about or whatever , phd e : sure . professor b : because you 're more experienced with running the large vocabulary stuff . phd d : so i 'll point you to the web site and the mails corresponding . so i phd e : and it but it 's not ready yet , the system ? phd d : uh , i i think they are still , uh , tuning something on that . so they 're like , d they 're varying different parameters like the insertion penalty and other stuff , and then seeing what 's the performance . phd e : are those going to be parameters that are frozen , nobody can change ? or ? phd d : uh , w i guess there is , uh , time during which people are gon na make suggestions . phd e : oh , but everybody 's gon na have to use the same values . phd d : after that . phd e : oh ! interesting . phd d : yeah , i guess . so these sugges these this , uh , period during which people are gon na make suggestions is to know whether it is actually biased towards any set of features or professor b : yeah , so i th th certainly the thing that i would want to know about is whether we get really hurt , uh , on in insertion penalty , language model , scaling , sorts of things . phd e : using our features . professor b : yeah , yeah . phd e : yeah . professor b : uh , in which case , um , h hari or hynek will need to , you know , push the case more about about this . phd e : mm - hmm . and we may be able to revisit this idea about , you know , somehow modifying our features to work with professor b : yes . in this case , that 's right . phd e : yeah . professor b : that 's right . um , some of that may be , uh , a last minute rush thing because if the if our features are changing uh . phd e : yeah . professor b : uh . but , um . yeah , the other thing is that even though it 's months away , uh , it 's starting to seem to me now like november fifteenth is right around the corner . and , um , if they have n't decided things like this , like what the parameters are gon na be for this , uh , when `` deciding `` is not just somebody deciding . i mean , in fact there should be some understanding behind the , uh , deciding , which means some experiments and and so forth . it it it seems pretty tight to me . phd e : so wha what 's the significance of november fifteenth ? professor b : that 's when the evaluation is . yeah . so , yeah , so after but , you know , they may even decide in the end to push it off . it would n't , you know , entirely surprise me . but , uh , due to other reasons , like some people are going away , i 'm i 'm hoping it 's not pushed off for a l a long while . that would be , uh put us in an awkward position . but anyway . great . yeah , i think that 'll be helpful . there 's there 's not anybody ogi currently who 's who 's , uh , working with this and and phd e : is is this part of the evaluation just a small part , or ho how important is this to the overall ? professor b : i i think it 's it 's , um it depends how badly you do . i mean , i think that it it is uh . phd e : this is one of those things that will be debated afterwards ? professor b : yeah . well , i mean , it 's it 's conceptually , it my impression , again , you guys correct me if i 'm wrong , but my impression is that , um , they want it as a double check . that you have n't come across you have n't invented features which are actually gon na do badly for a a significantly different task , particularly one with larger vocabulary . and , um , but it 's not the main emphasis . i mean , the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary . so it 's it 's a double check . so they 'll probably assign it some sort of low weight . phd e : seems to me that if it 's a double check , they should give you a one or a zero . y you passed the threshold or you did n't pass the threshold , and they should n't even care about what the score is . professor b : yeah . but , i mean , we 'll we 'll we 'll see what they come up with . uh , but in in the current thing , for instance , where you have this well - matched , moderately - matched , and and mis highly - mismatched , uh , the emphasis is somewhat on the on the well - matched , but it 's only a a marginal , phd e : yeah . professor b : right ? it 's like forty , thirty - five , twenty - five , or something like that . so you still if you were way , way off on the highly - mismatched , it would have a big effect . phd d : yeah . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : and , um , it would n't surprise me if they did something like that with this . so again , if you 're if you get if it does n't help you much , uh , for noisy versions of this of large vocabulary data , then , uh , you know , it may not hurt you that much . but if it if you do n't if it does n't help you much at all , um , or to put it another way , if it helps some people a lot more than it helps other people , uh , if their strategies do , then phd e : mm - hmm . so is this , uh ? uh , guenter was putting a bunch of wall street journal data on our disks . professor b : that 's it . phd e : so that 's the data that we 'll be running on ? professor b : yeah . phd e : i see . ok . professor b : yeah . so we have the data , just not the recognizer . ok . phd e : so this test may take quite a while to run , then . may - judging by the amount of data that he was putting on . professor b : uh , well there 's training and test , right ? phd e : i i guess , i 'm not sure . professor b : no , i mean , if it 's like the other things , there 's there 's data for training the h m ms and and data for testing it . phd e : i just professor b : so i would n't so it it 's phd e : ok . so there 's professor b : so , training the recognizer , but , um um . but i think it 's trained on clean and is it trained on clean and and test on ? phd d : the wall street ? professor b : yeah . phd a : apparently , no . it 's training on a range between ten and twenty db , i think , and testing between five and fifteen . phd d : mm - hmm . yeah . phd a : that 's what i got on phd d : it 's , uh it 's like a medium medium - mismatch condition , sort of . phd a : yeah , professor b : i see . phd a : and so the noise is there is a range of different noises also um which are selected randomly and added randomly , uh , to the files . and there are noises that are different from the noises used on ti - digits . professor b : yeah . yeah . i mean , i would n't imagine that the amount of testing data was that huge . they probably put training uh , almost certain they put training data there too . maybe not . so . that 's that . anybody have anything else ? phd e : uh , one one last question on that . when did they estimate that they would have that system available for download ? phd d : um , i guess i guess one some preliminary version is already there . phd e : oh , so there 's w something you can download to just learn ? phd d : yeah , it 's already there . yeah . but they 're actually parallel - y doing some modifications also , i think . phd e : good . phd d : so i guess the f final system will be frozen by middle of , like , one more week maybe . professor b : oh , well that 's pretty soon . phd d : yeah , that 's just one more . grad c : is this their , um , svm recognizer ? phd d : no , it 's just a straightforward hmm . professor b : you know , their their they have a lot of options in their recognizer and and the svm is one of the things they 've done with it , but it 's not their more standard thing . grad c : oh , ok . uh - huh . professor b : for the most part it 's it 's gaussian mixtures . grad c : oh , ok . oh , ok . professor b : yeah . phd d : it 's just a hmm , gaussian mixture model . grad c : gaussian mixture hmm . professor b : yeah . yeah , the svm thing was an hmm also . it was just a it it it was like a hybrid , like grad c : mm - hmm . phd d : yeah , this is a g yeah , this i professor b : what ? phd d : yeah . professor b : yeah . phd e : so , just so that i understand , they 're providing scripts and everything so that basically , uh , you you push a button and it does training , and then it does test , and everything ? is that the idea ? phd d : i i i think yeah , i i guess something like that . it 's like as painless as possible , phd e : mm - hmm . phd d : is what do they provide all the scripts , everything , and then just , phd e : i see . hmm . somehow yo there 's hooks to put your features in and phd d : ju yeah , i th i think . professor b : hmm . yeah , um . in fact , i mean , if you look into it a little bit , it might be reasonable you know joe , right ? yeah . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : just to sort of ask him about the issue of , um , different features having different kinds of , uh , scaling characteristics and so on . so that , you know , w w possibly having entirely different optimal values for for the usual twiddle factors and what 's what 's the plan about that ? phd d : so sh shall we , like , add chuck also to the mailing lists ? it may be better , i mean , in that case if he 's going to professor b : yeah . phd d : because there 's a mailing list for this . professor b : is that ok ? phd e : yeah , that 'd be great . phd d : yeah , i guess maybe hari or hynek , one of them , has to send a mail to joe . or maybe if you phd e : i i could send him an email . phd d : well , yeah , to add or maybe wh phd e : i i know him really well . phd d : yeah , so that 's just fine . phd e : i i was just talking with him on email the other day actually . phd d : so professor b : uh , yeah , and just , um , se maybe see . phd d : so phd e : about other things , but . professor b : do you have hari 's , uh ? phd e : i have hari 's professor b : yeah , so maybe just cc hari and say that you 've just been asked to handle the large vocabulary part here , and , uh , you know , phd e : ok . would it be better if i asked hari to ask joe ? professor b : uh . why do n't you just ask joe but cc hari , and then in the note say , `` hari , hopefully this is ok with you `` . and then if joe feels like he needs a confirmation , hari can answer it . phd d : yeah . professor b : that way you can get started asking { comment } joe quickly while he 's while he 's maybe still , you know , putting in nails and screws and yeah . phd d : and there is an , uh , archive of all the mails that has been gon that has gone , uh , between these people among these people . so just you can see all this mails in the isip web site mississippi web site . phd e : ok . is that a password controlled ? phd d : yeah , it 's password protected . so , like like , it 's , like professor b : have you thought about how long would be uh , most useful for you to go up to ogi ? phd a : i do n't know , uh . we can for september , we can set up a work schedule and we can maybe work independently . and then at some point it maybe be better to work together again . professor b : oh , so you 're you 're imagining more that you would come back here first for a while and then and then go up there ? phd a : i professor b : i mean , it 's to you . phd a : maybe , yeah . professor b : i ju you guys are well , y anyway , you do n't have to decide this second but thi think about it about what what you would think would be the the best way to work it . i 'll phd a : but , uh huh . mm - hmm . professor b : support it either way , so . phd a : mm - hmm right . professor b : ok . uh . got anything to tell us ? grad c : um . well , i 've been reading some literature about clustering of data . just , um , i guess , let me put it in context . ok , so we 're talking about discovering intermediate categories to , um to classify . and , uh , i was looking at some of the work that , uh , sangita was doing on these traps things . so she has , um she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from from timit , right ? the most common phonemes . and each one of them has has a a nice pattern over time , a one one second window . and it has has these patterns . um , so she has , um a trap for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . and , um , she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points many different clusters uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data . and then you have this distance mej metric which , uh , measures how how closely related they are . and you start , um by merging the patterns that are most closely related . phd e : and you create a tree . grad c : and y yeah , yeah , a dendrogram tree . phd e : mm - hmm . and then you can pick , uh , values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters . grad c : right , usually it 's when , um when the sol similarity measures , um , do n't go down as much . phd e : mm - hmm . grad c : and so , uh so you stop at that point . and what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . professor b : mm - hmm . grad c : and , uh , one for silence and and another one for schwa schwa sounds . um , and , um , i was thinking about ways to to generalize this because w you 're it 's sort of like a it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these these traps and you 're saying that that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme . um , and that 's that 's constraining your your clustering to to the set of phonemes that you already have . um , whereas maybe we want to just take take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . phd e : mm - hmm . grad c : and i 'm thinking if we if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , ok , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable stable point . phd e : mm - hmm . grad c : um , and i 'm hoping to find other things of of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um intermediate categories that , uh , um , i 'll later classify . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : are you looking at these in narrow bands ? grad c : um , right . f um , i 'm professor b : cuz that 's what you 're gon na be using , right ? grad c : yeah , yeah . i i have n't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh , the the representation of the data that i was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , um , over different lengths of time . so yeah . professor b : yeah , i mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that i wonder about with this . i mean , so one is is , again , looking at the same representation , i mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : that that seems to be kind of fundamental to it . um , and then the other thing , uh , is that i wonder about with it , and and do n't take this in the wrong way , like i i know what i 'm doing or anything , grad c : right . professor b : but , i mean . um , just wondering really . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or or parameters um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better . um , and i do n't know if that i mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe maybe this is n't right , but it 'd be something i 'd be concerned about . because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from from , uh from your your quals , john ohala saying that , uh , `` buh `` { comment } and `` puh `` { comment } differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . i mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so , um , if you looked if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . and yet , i would gue i would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , { comment } screwing up on this distinction . grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . and the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they do n't work as well as we 'd like . and since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , `` how well is it distinguishing between schwas and stops ? `` grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : boy , i bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ? grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : so these these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . so , what are we bringing to the party ? i mean , in fact what we wan na do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together . so that 's th that 's the hard thing . i mean , i understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wan na have categories that , uh that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . and it 's something that you really think you can pick up . but i think it 's also essential that you wan na look at what are the confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions . grad c : mm - hmm . hmm . professor b : so , i mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it . y y this is more like , you know , how does lda differ from pca ? i mean , they 're the same sort of thing . they 're both orthogonalizing . grad c : right . professor b : but , you know and and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . you 're actually trying to find the the the the categories themselves . uh , so a little more like brain surgery , i think on yourself . uh . so , uh grad c : yeah . professor b : um , anyway . that 's my thought . you 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . i mean , well w actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it a lot . phd e : yeah . professor b : and you 've been thinking about it more now , phd d : yeah . professor b : these categories . phd e : yeah . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : i guess i do n't i do n't um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which i think is right , with the way i 've been looking at it . that it 's it 's it 's all not very clear to me . but it seems to me that the desire the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up . you know , however we do that . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : and and so i guess what i do n't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human human sig significant categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . professor b : right . phd e : but that 's sort of what you want to avoid . and so that feels i do n't know how to get out of this . professor b : well , here 's a here 's a , uh , uh here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , um , what do you really i mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that that have something from top - down in th in them . right ? because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it does n't have any kind of reward for doing or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : so whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's got ta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning , phd e : right . professor b : right ? phd e : so the question is , how far down ? we could stop at words , but we do n't , right ? we go all the way down to phonemes . professor b : right , but i me i i think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is is trying to deal with the with these phonemes . you know , and and and i it 's almost like you want categories if if our if our , uh , um , metric of of goodness , uh , i if our phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : correction if our metric of badness is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : i mean , for for for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , but i i i if you go all the way to words , i mean , that 's really i mean , d w in many applications you wan na go further . you wan na go to concepts or something , or have have have concepts , actions , this sort of thing . phd e : yeah . but words would be a nice professor b : but , words are n't bad , yeah . and and phd e : yeah , so the common right , the common wisdom is you ca n't do words because there 's too many of them , right ? so you have to have some smaller set that you can use , uh , and and so everybody goes to phonemes . but the problem is that we we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are are really cartoon - ish , right ? so when you look at conversational speech , for example , you do n't see the phonemes that you that you have in your word models . professor b : yeah . but but but we 're not trying for models of words here . see , so her here 's maybe where if the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then maybe it does n't matter that we ca n't have enough phd e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : i mean , what you wan na do is is build up these categories that are that are best for word recognition . phd e : right . right . professor b : and and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories i mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of of running o a thousand experiments phd e : right . professor b : because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate . phd e : yeah . professor b : in some way i mean , we derive that all the time . in some ways it 's really not { comment } a bad bad thing to do because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the the final goal . phd e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way , phd e : right . professor b : where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other it could be syllable but in some large unit , phd e : uh - huh . professor b : uh , and uh yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of do n't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : you know , so that 's , uh , wh what i called a useless comments because i 'm not really telling you how to do it . but i mean , it 's a it 's it 's , you know it phd e : no , but i think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have uh , you know , categories . professor b : right . phd e : and i think this the important categories are the words , and not the phones . professor b : yeah . yeah . phd e : maybe . and so right . if you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters uh professor b : now , that being said , i think that that if you have something that is , um i once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are are really true . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : if you have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like timit , then , you know , i i you the phones are gon na be right , actually , for the most part . phd e : yeah . yeah , professor b : so so , uh , it does n't really hurt them to to do that , to put in discrimination at that level . phd e : yeah . professor b : um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's it 's trickier and and and , uh , the phones are uh , you know , it 's gon na be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of and , um and it wo n't allow for the overlapping phenomenon phd e : mmm . so it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we we deal with that , but but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it does n't really matter that much to us as humans because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be munged , you know , and and it does n't really hurt , and i 'm not sure how how to build that in . uh . professor b : yeah , i mean , i guess the other thing i is is to think of a little bit i mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results i think it usually is is pretty intuitive , but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or or or , uh , even phones in in in in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise . you know , so is it more across place or more across manner ? or is it cor you know , is it ? grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : i mean , i know one thing that happens is that you you you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones . i mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones sometimes do n't get heard . and if that if that is if it uh , if that turns it into another word or or different you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen . but , um , i do n't know , i w i would i would guess that you 'd grad c : mm - hmm . professor b : w i do n't know . anyway , that 's phd e : i think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : you know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation . and so if there 's noise in there , you know , our brain fills in and imagines what what should be there . professor b : well that grad c : yeah . we 're we 're doing some sort of prediction of what phd e : yeah , exactly . professor b : oh , sure , that 's really big . grad c : yeah . professor b : uh , but i mean , even if you do um , uh , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really is n't an any information like that , uh , people are still better in noise than they than they are in in , uh uh , than the machines are . so , i mean , that 's i right . we ca n't we ca n't get it at all without any language models . language models are there and important but but , uh uh . if we 're not working on that then we should work on something else and improve it , but especially if it looks like the potential is there . so should we do some digits ? phd e : yeah . professor b : since we 're here ? phd e : go ahead , morgan ."}

\n国家卫生健康委员会新闻发言人米锋:各位媒体朋友,大家上午好。欢迎参加国家卫生健康委“巡礼十三五·迈向全民健康这五年”专题新闻发布会。“十三五”时期,浙江省卫生健康系统在深化医改、改善医疗卫生服务、优化资源配置、提升综合服务能力等方面开展积极有益探索,加快推动卫生健康治理的现代化。“健康浙江”建设全面推进,群众健康获得感得到有效提升。今天的发布会我们将重点介绍浙江省卫生健康工作的这些工作进展和取得的积极成效。今天发布会我们请来了浙江省卫生健康委主任张平先生、杭州市卫生健康委主任孙雍容女士、浙江大学医学院附属第一医院党委书记梁廷波先生、浙江省开化县委书记鲁霞光先生,请他们共同介绍有关情况,并回答媒体提问。首先,请张平主任介绍浙江省“十三五”时期卫生健康事业发展的总体情况。浙江省卫生健康委主任张平:各位媒体朋友上午好,首先非常感谢大家长期以来对浙江卫生健康工作的关心和支持。早在2003年,时任浙江省委书记的习近平同志指出,“没有健康就没有小康;没有卫生现代化,就没有整个社会的现代化”。这些年,浙江沿着习近平总书记指引的卫生现代化之路,一张蓝图绘到底。“十三五”以来,浙江省深入贯彻新时代党的卫生健康工作方针,聚焦高质量竞争力现代化,聚力“1+5”改革发展攻坚战,卫生健康事业取得显著成就。一、坚持健康优先发展战略,高水平健康浙江建设全面推进。第一时间启动健康浙江26个专项行动,率先把区域健康发展纳入市县党政领导班子目标责任制考核,率先实现国家卫生城市(县城)全覆盖,持续提升群众健康水平。2019年,人均期望寿命达79.13岁,比2015年增加0.91岁;居民健康素养水平29.49%,高出全国平均10.32个百分点;孕产妇死亡率、婴儿死亡率分别下降到4.08/10万和1.88‰,居民主要健康指标接近或达到高收入国家水平。二、坚持以新发展理念为引领,卫生健康创新力竞争力全面提高。布局建设1个国家医学中心、7个国家区域医疗中心,落地运行中科院基础医学与肿瘤研究所,2019年三甲综合医院疑难重症患者同比增53.9%、三四级手术同比增56.5%。强化政府数字化转型,电子健康卡和电子社保(医保)卡实现“两卡融合”,县级以上医院“看病不用卡,只需一个码”,实现出生证、户口本、医保卡“多证一起办、一次都不跑”;浙江省互联网医院在线服务超1800万人次。放大综合医改集成效应,在全国三级公立医院绩效考核中,综合排名和“a++”等级医院排名均列第三。2015到2019年,个人卫生支出占卫生总费用的比重从29.5%降至25.2%;药占比从35%降至29.9%,医疗服务收入占比从27.3%升至30.7%。三、坚持重心下移、资源下沉,基层医疗卫生服务能力全面增强。作为全国县域医共体建设试点省,208家县级医院、1063家乡镇卫生院整合成161家医共体,全部由二甲以上医院牵头,打破原有层级分割,实行扁平化管理和垂直化运行,2019年乡镇卫生院门急诊、出院人次分别增长12.4%和11.3%,170家卫生院恢复或新开展一二类手术。11个设区市全部纳入国家城市医联体建设试点,市、区、街道层级清晰、功能整合的一体化运行模式有效构建。2015年到2019年,县域就诊率、基层首诊率分别从82.1%、49.9%提高到88.3%和52.7%,有序就医格局加快形成。我在这里特别要跟媒体朋友报道的是,我们现在有个非常好的现象,原来我们病人从下级医院转往上级医院的很多,但是从上级医院转往社区、转往基层去康复的不多,但是现在我们正在改变这样的局面,像今年1-9月,我们县里的医共体向下转诊达到17.9万次,平均每个县级医院向乡村卫生院下转1100多人次,打破了下转上易、上转下难的瓶颈问题。四、坚持向“看病难”“看病烦”持续发力,群众健康获得感全面提升。浙江省紧紧扭牢群众看病就医当中反映强烈的堵点痛点难点,率先启动医疗卫生服务领域“最多跑一次”改革,2018年浙江省首次推出了看病少跑腿、检查少排队等十大举措,入选全国医改十大新举措,2019年浙江省又推出新十大举措,中央深改办也专门刊发了我们的做法,今年浙江省又提出了完善公共场所服务支持措施,持续推动就医体验大提升。城市医院高峰时段排队平均时间缩短三分之二,今年原来排队平均排8.2分钟,现在排队2.61分钟,分时段就诊预约控制在30分钟以内,平均住院日从8.6天下降到6.9天。常态化推进民生实事,每年推出一批健康惠民新项目纳入浙江省政府十方面民生实事,像今年的3岁以下婴幼儿照护服务机构和托位建设,还为70岁以上老年人免费接种流感疫苗,对高危人群进行大肠癌免费筛查,这些民生项目都获得了很好的社会效益,也收获了群众很好的口碑。比如今年浙江省对高危人群的大肠癌筛查,一共筛查了12.5万人,其中筛查出大肠癌的,大肠癌癌前病变和良性病变的检出率分别是0.83%、8.15%和36.2%,通过数据分析,仅仅这个项目应该说不仅救治了1000多名患者,还挽救了有可能罹患大病重病的5.5万个家庭,如果统计一下,按照大肠癌患者的每个均例费用大概是17.3万元,也就是罹患大肠癌以后住院、治疗、手术、放疗,大肠癌癌前病变的治疗费用,每一笔大概是2.4万,仅这么一个民生项目,就可以节省群众的医药费用、减轻群众的负担,或者为医保节约费用28亿多元,所以群众反映的,更多的减少了罹患大病家庭的痛苦。五、坚持全方位保障人民健康,公共卫生体系建设全面加强。强化预防为主,突出中西医并重,落地“两员一中心一团队”机制,这个“两员一中心一团队”机制主要是落实在县域医共体,加强基层的预防保健工作、医防协同工作。浙江省启动了高血压、糖尿病“两慢病”全周期健康管理。2019年全省甲、乙类传染病总报告发病率降至175.02/10万,重大慢病过早死亡率下降至9.04%。面对突出其来的新冠肺炎疫情,浙江省率先启动“一级响应”,坚决做到“外防输入、内防扩散”,不断提升防控和救治能力。目前,疫情防控的精密智控指数已经升级到6.0版本,在国务院第七次大督查中,浙江省的做法也得到了通报表扬。到今天来计算的话,已经连续189天无新增确诊的本地病例报告。下一步,浙江将深入贯彻党的十九届五中全会精神,紧扣忠实践行“八八战略”,奋力打造重要窗口的主题主线,力争率先实现卫生健康现代化,为建成健康中国提供浙江方案。谢谢大家。米锋:谢谢张平主任,下面进入今天现场提问环节,请各位记者朋友围绕今天的发布主题进行提问,提问前请通报所在的新闻机构。新华社记者:党的十九届五中全会提出要加快优质医疗资源扩容和区域均衡布局,请问浙江在这方面作出了哪些实践?谢谢。张平:这个问题非常好。十九届五中全会,大家都非常关注一句话,“推动优质医疗资源扩容和区域均衡布局”,我认为这实际上是医疗服务供给侧改革的重要内容。这几年浙江在这方面做了一些探索和实践,也取得了比较好的成效。具体来说主要做了三件事:第一,实施“双下沉、两提升”工程。就是通过省市三级医院的技术下沉和管理下沉,来提升县级医院的医疗技术水平和管理水平,实现从城市医院强到县级医院强的发展。浙江省54家城市三级医院与122家县级医院建立了紧密型的合作关系,县级医院的整体服务能力通过“双下沉、两提升”得到了明显提升。比如说县级医院的手术台次数年均增长15%,浙江省的所有县级综合医院都能够开展胃肠手术,整体实力得到大大加强,县级医院的龙头学科达到166个。第二,全力推进县域医共体建设。我刚才也向各位媒体朋友作了介绍,医共体的目的是要使我们县级医院的技术和服务延伸到乡镇和基层,实现从县级医院强到整个县域医疗卫生服务强的目的。全省共组建161个医共体,这161个医共体是完全按照一家人、一本账和一盘棋的体制机制进行运行的,在人财物方面实行一体化管理。目前,浙江省平均每天有将近5000名的县级医院医生是在乡镇卫生院进行定期的排班工作,也许今天这个岗位在县级医院手术,明天这个县级医院医生的岗位就是在乡镇卫生院看门诊,我们叫做“业务垂直化、管理扁平化”。现在全省是95.7%的乡镇卫生院能够开展门诊手术,89%的乡镇卫生院的门急诊人次增幅要高于我们县级医院的门急诊人次的增幅。我刚才跟大家介绍,这是一个非常可喜的现象,群众更多是选择在基层看病、在家门口看病,而不要舟车劳顿跑到县里甚至市里、省里看病,这是一个非常重要的改革。我们是希望群众在家门口能够看得上病、看得好病成为现实。第三,全省聚力打造医学高峰。浙江省以国家医学中心和国家区域医疗中心为重点,以大型三甲医院为载体,以重大项目为抓手,浙江省财政三年共安排50亿专项资金,用于医学高峰的建设,也是发挥我们集中力量办大事的制度优势,来加快浙江省优质医疗资源的扩充和扩容。近两年来共引育国家级医学人才55名,目前浙江省国家级医学人才达到285名,全国百强学科数也已经增加到212个,有51个专科列入国家临床重点专科的建设项目。我们通过这三件事,促进优质医疗资源扩容,壮大优质医疗资源,通过“双下沉、两提升”,通过县域医共体使优质医疗资源实现梯次分布、均衡分布。下一步,这也是在编制“十四五”规划当中,在配置医疗卫生资源过程中要重点关注和重点推动的一项工作。谢谢。香港中评社记者:破解看病贵,问题关键是推进医保支付方式改革,请问浙江省开化县在县域内怎样发挥医保基金的调节和杠杆作用,降低群众就医负担的?浙江省开化县委书记鲁霞光:感谢这位记者朋友的提问。浙江开化县重点突出“定、分、合、管”四个关键字,来实施总额预算管理下的多元复合支付方式改革,有效地降低群众的就医负担。“定”就是定总额,以上一年度的医保基金决算总额为基础,确定下一年度的医保基金的预算。近两年来,全县的医保基金按年增长10%来确定,比如说2019年和2020年,结算的总额分别增支三千万和四千万的额度。“分”分蛋糕,将全县的医保资金总盘子按照服务体量、人均基金的支付水平分给全县的两家医共体,县人民医院总院、县中医院总院,并实现总额预付、结余留用、超支合理分担的激励约束机制,倒逼医共体通过吸引群众县内就医,避免重复检查等方式来控费,实现群众看病省钱,基金支出下降,医院服务提升。这里有个数据,今年以来,全县职工的医保和居民医保支出同比分别下降1.88个百分点和3.84个百分点。“合”强合力,开化县通过实现医保差异化报销政策,实施百名医生进百村、健康巡诊等机制措施,合理促进分级诊疗。比如说群众在乡镇的医疗机构的住院报销比例就在县一级医院,比例要高10%。家庭医生签约患者还可以在这样一个比例基础上再提升3%。群众在家门口看病是实实在在费用下降了,得到实惠了。解决了大医院门庭若市,乡镇医院门可罗雀的现象。今年以来全县乡镇的住院人次较医共体改革前增长了138.5%,向下转诊率显著提升。“管”严监管,通过开发医保智慧监管和聘请第三方的专业稽查,来精准排查并处置有可能发生的医保套高、分解入院等违规行为和重复检查等不规范诊疗行为,严控不合理的收费现象来切实地降低群众就医支出。谢谢。《人民周刊》记者:我们知道2022年第十九届亚运会将在杭州举行,想请杭州市卫健委孙主任介绍一下在服务健康亚运的安保方面做了哪些工作。谢谢。杭州市卫生健康委主任孙雍容:谢谢媒体朋友的提问。2022年杭州市将举办亚运会和亚残运会,应该说体育健身锻炼是增进人民健康的最主要一种方法,同时亚运赛事的举办也是提升一个城市健康水平的主要途径。杭州市按照“办好一个会、提升一座城”的目标,实现了体育盛事的举办筹办、健康城市的发展和人民健康素质的提升协同推进。在亚运会的筹办过程中,我们努力实现健康资源的共享,把亚运的健康城市建设作为杭州市推进亚运筹备工作的首要工作。同时,杭州市2020年举办了1200多场次的健康健身培训,举办1500多场体育赛事,推进了36个公共场所体育健身服务场馆的服务大提升,新增了社区多功能的公共运动场23个,增加了百姓健身场馆177个,全面的实施亚运的八项行动。我们努力让健康的服务质量提升,通过筹办启动了国际化医院的创建工作,同时在“城市大脑”舒心就医,实现救护车“一键护航”的应用场景,并立法推动aed在公共场所的使用,杭州的36个比赛场馆和8个训练场馆当中还增设了母婴设施和大力推进残疾人的无障碍设施的建设。这一系列的举措既为亚运会和亚残运会做好准备,同时也提升了一座城市的温度。另外,我们努力守护这座城市的健康环境,围绕杭州的“数智杭州·宜居天堂”的目标,通过实施“迎亚运”的城市市容市貌提升、环境质量提升、城乡公共厕所管理质量的提升、垃圾分类、市民健康生活方式提升等迎亚运的一系列行动,让市民在喜迎亚运的同时也共享青山绿水的健康环境。谢谢。凤凰网记者:刚才张平主任所说浙江省启动了医学高峰建设计划,浙江大学医学院附属第一医院作为牵头医院,请问咱们医院的建设以及成效如何?医学高峰建设计划如何推动区域医疗水平提升,更好地服务百姓、惠及百姓?谢谢。浙江大学医学院附属第一医院党委书记梁廷波:谢谢你的提问。浙江大学医学院附属第一医院作为浙江省打造医学高峰的重点医院,深切感受到了浙江省委、省政府打造医学高峰的决心,通过项目支持、资金支持、政策支持几个方面,为医院高质量发展起到了积极推动作用。在医学高峰建设牵引下,医院紧扣高质量发展要求,学科建设各项工作对标国际一流,进一步明确了建设路径,强化推进引人、育才等工作,在以下几个方面取得了成效:第一,人才汇聚效应迅速的展现。2019年至今,医院共引进海外高层次人才为代表的顶尖人才32名,本土培育的国家级人才8名,预计两年内浙江大学医学院附属第一医院专职科研人才可以达到10%的比例。累计签订国家级重大重点课题18项,牵头全球多中心临床研究22项,获得国家专利66项,发表高质量论文40篇,展现了蓬勃创新活力。第二,高峰学科优势不断拓展。医院拥有完整的大器官移植学科群,截至目前,浙江大学医学院附属第一医院已经完成肝移植总数超过4000例,肾脏移植超过了7000例,小肠移植超过40例。就今年来说,小肠移植已经达到了22例,列全球第一。肝脏移植已经达到419例,列全国第二,肾脏移植达到了438例,连续十年进入全国前三。心脏移植和肺脏移植及多器官联合移植在浙江大学医学院附属第一医院也是常规的广泛开展,浙江大学医学院附属第一医院是目前国内开展大器官移植门类最全的医院,所以说无论在移植数量、移植质量和种类上,都达到了国际领先水平。传染病科在h7n9、禽流感疫情、新冠肺炎疫情等重大公共卫生事件中开展了病原溯源分离疫苗的研发、诊疗方案的制定,充分展现了传染病中心的“领头雁”的作用,代表了传染病国家的防治能力。第三,综合实力与行业影响力持续攀高。2020年,国家三级公立医院绩效考核,浙江大学医学院附属第一医院名列全国1%,stem排行榜进入了全国前三,复旦排行榜连续多年名列国内前茅,普通外科、血液科、肾脏病科、临床药学等多个学科进入全国前五或者前十。在带动区域整体提升方面,我们做了很多探索工作,通过构建紧密型医联体,构筑城市的医联体,织密远程医疗协作网,成立专科联盟等不同方式先后与省内外86家县级市级医院建立多种协作关系。“十三五”期间总计向托管医院派驻医护人员5000人次。特别是这两年来在全国推行了“小黄人”公益计划,一年来共实施200例儿童肝移植,患者来自西部贫困地区的11个省74个县,其中贫困县、极度贫困县占了4.8%,200个家庭避免了因病致贫、因病返贫的问题,与全国15个省建立帮扶合作关系,极大提升了全国儿童中末期肝病的诊治能力,这是践行大型公立医院初心使命跨地区、跨省份助力脱贫攻坚,践行习近平总书记“健康中国”“以人民健康为中心”指示的具体实践。谢谢。《中国青年报》记者:全国卫生与健康大会上提出,要推动将健康融入所有政策,把全生命周期健康管理理念贯穿城市规划、建设、管理的全过程、各环节。请问杭州在推动将健康融入所有政策方面可以给群众带来哪些实实在在的红利?谢谢。孙雍容:谢谢这位媒体记者的提问。将健康融入所有政策是落实“健康中国”战略的重要举措,也是贯彻落实浙江“健康浙江”26项行动的具体举措。近年来,杭州在努力推进将健康融入城市规划、城市管理、公共政策,比如说城市的空间规划、部门职责等方面,较早开展了公共政策健康影响的评价工作。在杭州市新一轮的城市空间规划提升政策里面,我们提出了对道路的等级设置、绿地的布局,减少意外伤害、促进呼吸健康、公共健身设施的配置等方面提出了大量健康建议,规划部门全部采纳。2020年杭州新增了绿道501.37公里,至此杭州拥有绿道3713公里,杭州市区的居民实现5分钟可达绿道的网络。实施杭州淳安特别生态功能区建设的实施意见当中,我们提出了前瞻性的健康评估,提出城市发展均等化,促进弱势群体健康公平的建议,也得到了采纳。在淳安有个很知名的千岛湖引水工程,我们提出建立风险化合物的清单、完善农村污水处理设施等建议。2020年9月,淳安千岛湖饮水工程正式启用,杭州市民饮用到了安全有品质的饮用水,水质得到了极大提升。所以说,公共政策影响的评价实施改善了杭州市的健康环境,提升了居民的健康素质,也引导了市民的健康行为。杭州市经常参加体育锻炼的人口明显增加,居民的健康素养比例达到34.9%。应该说健康理念已经深入人心,健康习惯也蔚然成风。谢谢。红星新闻记者:共建共享全民健康是建设健康中国的战略主题,杭州是全国健康城市试点城市,健康城市不同于传统的卫生城市,杭州在健康城市创建过程中有哪些方面提升最为明显?市民从中有哪些获益?五年来,“健康杭州”建设是如何实现全民健康共治,推进健康治理能力现代化的?谢谢。孙雍容:谢谢你对健康杭州建设的关心关注。杭州市健康城市的建设过程是一个从全民动员到全民共享、健康共治的探索发展历程。62年前,毛主席视察了杭州小营巷的爱国卫生工作,杭州也掀起了爱国卫生运动的高潮。四年前,杭州市成为新一轮健康城市的试点城市,作为省会城市建设与“重要窗口”“名城战略”相匹配,与经济社会发展相吻合,与人民健康需求相适应的“健康杭州”已经摆在我们面前。杭州市接续推进“健康杭州”建设,健康治理的现代化水平以及“健康杭州”的社会公认度有显著提升。国内主流媒体、世界卫生组织多次给予杭州高度肯定。特别是疫情防控期间,健康码的疫情防控的应用,“城市大脑”“舒心就医”等一批创新项目在国内领先,驻企健康指导、企业健康管理员培训认证制度,未来健康屋、金牌讲师巡讲团、健康素养进农村文化礼堂等一系列的健康品牌带给了市民更多的健康体验。2019年杭州市的人均期望寿命达到82.95岁,婴幼儿死亡率和孕产妇死亡率逐步下降到千分之1.65和2.75/10万,这些指标达到发达国家水平。最近杭州市下发了《杭州市推进大健康治理现代化的实施意见》,把“健康杭州”的建设摆在更加重要位置,杭州将通过数字赋能、建立健康的共治生态体系,让人民群众有更多的健康获得感。诚挚地希望媒体朋友们关心杭州的“健康杭州”建设,助力杭州市早日实现健康治理的现代化,为健康中国、健康浙江样板出力。谢谢。中国县域卫生记者:一直以来县域医共体建设都是浙江医改的特色,此背景下我想了解开化县如何出台具体措施提升县域医共体的水平和落实“小县城也有大健康”目标的?谢谢。鲁霞光:谢谢这位记者朋友的提问。浙江开化县主要是通过打造、管理、服务、发展三个共同体来推动县域医共体改革的落地、落实、落细。第一,打造管理共同体。我们成立了县域医共体管委会,形成了党政主要领导亲自推动,各职能部门密切配合、各医疗机构协同作战的组织架构。同时整合全县的公立医疗机构,构建与县人民医院和县中医院为总院,疾控中心、妇保医院为专科联盟,乡镇卫生院整体纳入的“2+n”的医共体架构,设唯一的法定代表人,强化党建统领,实现党委下的院长负责制。自主管理医共体内部的职称业务等发展,真正从“各自为政”,变为“一家人”。第二,打造服务共同体。巩固深化县级医院与省市医院合作办医,做强县级龙头,力争大病不出县,在15个乡镇卫生院现在叫乡镇分院,全部开设全专科的联合门诊,组建120支“总院专科医生+分院签约医生+驻村医生”的家庭医生签约服务团队进村入户,确保小病不出乡。与此同时,建立覆盖全县的远程会诊,区域影像、区域心电、质量控制、临床检验等五大资源的共享中心,来贯通基层的检查、上级的诊断、区域的互认的服务链条,让老百姓愿意在家门口看病就医。这两年来,乡镇的首诊率从52.32%提升至64.05%,全县域的就诊率从81.8%提高到90.75%,应该说成效非常明显。第三,打造发展共同体。实施人员、资源、信息三统筹,财务、药械、绩效三统一的高效运行机制,力推扁平化管理、垂直化运行。同时强化医疗、医药、医保三医联动改革,我们的医保资金实现总额预算、结余留用、超支合理分担,统一打包拨付给医共体使用,变医疗收入为医院成本,倒逼医院主动控费,争取结余留用,同时建立资金拨付和绩效奖金分配体系,今年以来全县公立医院医疗总费用同比下降7.19%,乡镇分院业务量同比提高16.06%,分院的医务人员年收入增幅在10%以上,应该说成效显著。谢谢。《浙江日报》记者:开化县位于浙江省最西边,是山区县,在让老百姓看得上病、看得好病方面,开化县做了哪些努力呢?谢谢。鲁霞光:感谢你对开化的关心。正如你所说,开化是典型的山区县,地处浙江母亲河钱塘江的源头,浙皖赣三省七县的交汇处,是浙江西大门,同时也是习近平总书记点赞的“好地方”“绿水青山就是金山银山”理念的实践示范地。这些年来,我们始终牢记习近平总书记的殷切嘱托,坚定“好地方必须有好健康、小县城也要大健康”这样的目标,通过引进来、送上门、跑起来破解瓶颈难题,努力让开化县老百姓有更多获得感和幸福感。一是优质资源引进来。我们打造“双下沉、两提升”的升级版,依托浙医二院、浙江医院等城市的三甲医院,建成了康复医学、中医肾病等十多个省市特色学科。同时,通过乡贤专家驿站、中医创新驿站等平台,引进省内外的知名专家下沉帮扶。比如借乡贤回归工程开展“博士家乡行”活动,建立了16个乡贤的专家工作站,目前全县日均有10余名省市专家来开化坐诊,专家的门诊量年均2万人次。二是健康服务送上门。为了破解开化县“九山半水半分田”的区域限制,偏远山区网格不全的问题,大力实施“百医进百村健康进万家”专项行动,县级专家定期下乡轮岗一次,乡镇医生每周必须下村坐诊一天,对全县100余个还没有卫生室的行政村实现驻点服务全覆盖。同时,通过流动医院、巡回医疗车,为群众提供家门口的健康服务。比如我们针对老年人的健康状况,制作了“红黄蓝”三色的分类管理卡,三级医生定期开门精准开展健康宣教、中医保健、临床会诊等服务。这里值得一体的是,开化县财政每年拿出500万元,为全县65岁以上的高血压和2型糖尿病患者终身免费发放药物。同时为90岁以上的老年人每年免费体检一次,有效打通了健康扶贫领域当中服务困难群众的“最后一公里”。前不久我在下乡调研的过程中,有一位老人家拉着我的手说:“书记,共产党真好!我们的医生专家真好”!他打电话专门给我说,家里的高血压药不多了,过几天“百医进百村”就到我们村了,要去领免费的药。他说比我亲儿子还亲,提醒很及时。去年我们还创成了衢州市首家国家级的慢性病综合防控示范区。三是医疗数据跑起来。我们还大力发展“互联网+医疗服务”,先后建立五大资源共享中心,打破健康数据的壁垒,实现互联互通、互动互享,县级专家通过远程心电、远程影像系统为乡镇分院每年年均阅片4万余分。比如乡镇拍片,乡人民医院第一时间给报告,特别是疫情一级响应期间,充分利用闭环管控、精密智控的机制,加强疫情常态化的防控,让1.6万人次就近享受远程服务,大大降低了人群聚集和流通的风险。截至目前开化县依然是全省11个疫情零病例县之一,牢牢护好了“浙西绿岛”。谢谢。中央广播电视总台央视新闻记者:我们知道浙江在大力推进卫生健康领域的数字化改革,目的是让老百姓有更好的就医体验,浙江采取了哪些措施实现这样的目标?谢谢。张平:感谢这位记者朋友的提问。互联网+医疗健康,我们理解它本质是通过数字赋能来提升我们的医疗健康服务效能。近年来,浙江省作为全国“互联网+医疗健康”的试点省,全面强化了卫生健康的数字化转型。我们目标是实现“三减一升”,减少重复办卡,减少重复排队,减少重复检查,提升管理水平。我们主要采取了几个方面的措施:一是建立省级统一预约挂号平台和互联网医院。目前已经接入全省1015家医院,注册用户超过1700万人,累计的预约量已经超过了6200万人次。我们还建成了全国首个集服务与监管一体的省级互联网医院平台。这个平台涵盖了“互联网+医疗”“互联网+药事”“互联网+护理”三大服务板块,涵盖了748家医疗机构,在今年的疫情期间,我们平均每天有3万人次接受线上医疗健康服务。二是强化业务流程再造。推进电子健康卡和电子社保卡的“两卡融合、一网通办”,让群众基于一个码就能获取预约挂号、在线取号、扫码就医、费用结算、报告查询、互联网复诊等医疗和医保服务。同时在“浙里办”的app上开通了国民医疗健康专区,整合全流程的线上就医服务,汇聚了生育登记、儿童免疫、健康证明等十余项便民服务,我们希望逐步打造掌上医疗健康服务生态圈,实际应用场景能够不断拓展。三是促进健康大数据的开放和共享。目前省级医学检查检验报告信息共享平台已经覆盖到340家县级以上医院,实现了跨地域、跨机构的诊间报告提醒和调阅,并向患者提供实时查询服务,全省共享检查检验结果已经超过2.1亿条,每日有超过3万患者可以实时查询报告。电子健康档案的开放已经覆盖到所有县市区,开放率达到54%。四是推动跨部门的业务协同应用。我们整合了卫健、公安、医保等部门的出生医学证明、预防接种证、户口登记、医保登记等多类事项,推动“出生一件事”协同办理,将办事材料精简到一份,现在新生儿出生各种证明办理只要提供一份材料就可以。原来十多个环节,现在只要一个环节就可以。时间也是平均压缩到3天内就可以全部办完,实现一次提交、多证联办、一站送达,目前已覆盖了全省所有县级以上的有助产服务的医疗机构。月均掌上联办量超过1万,每年惠及40多万新生儿家庭。五是创新精密智控服务与监管。浙江省通过推进“互联网+医疗服务”,实现了医院服务窗口从人工向自助机再向移动端的迈进,“互联网+医疗监管”实现了医疗过程的实时智能全程监管,特别是针对疫情防控的需要,我们建立了浙江省精密智控疫情防控智慧调度平台,健全多点出发的监测预警机制,推动多部门多层级的协同联动和高效响应。这个指挥平台也为浙江省实现“两手硬、两战赢”发挥了很重要的作用。谢谢。《健康报》记者:浙江大学医学院附属第一医院作为国家传染病医学中心,在这次抗疫过程中做了大量工作,咱们有什么感受和体会?下一步推进区域突发公共卫生事件建设体系的过程中咱们有什么想法?谢谢。梁廷波:谢谢这位记者朋友的提问。新冠肺炎疫情对国家是一个大考,对我们浙大医院所有的公立医院也是一场考验,我们坚持统一指挥、统一作战,在坚守浙江抗疫主战场的同时,为国内战场和国外战场也贡献了浙江大学医学院附属第一医院力量。第一,坚决落实“四个集中”的模式,迅速建成了主战场。作为浙江省危重患者集中的收治中心,建立落实集中患者、集中专家、集中资源、集中救治的原则,用12小时全面启动了浙江院区的隔离病房,用24小时全面转入了所有的确诊和疑似病例,72小时内完成了之江院区整个医院的改造,充分体现了医院党委守土有责、守土负责、守土尽责的使命,全院共收治105例的确诊患者中,重症和危重症占八成,危重患者34例,占全省95%以上。第二,实现“一人一策”的创新多学科诊治模式。在之江院区,我们集结了15个学科团队,医护人员超过700人,每天进行mdt多学科讨论会诊,制定精细化诊治方案,成功完成了全球首两例老年新冠肺炎的肺移植,一例新冠肺炎孕妇平安产子,一位96岁的高龄老人经过治疗后顺利康复,最终实现了105例患者的“零死亡”、实现我们所有疑似病人的“零漏诊”、医护人员“零感染”的“三个零”目标。第三,国内国际合力抗疫,分享浙江大学医学院附属第一医院新冠肺炎抗疫经验。我们牵头制定了新冠肺炎诊疗方案的浙江临床经验版,选派了多批专家赴各地会诊疑难病例,指导疫情防控,派出四批次152人驰援武汉,派出7人专家组赴意大利,直接连线五大洲50多个国家地区分享我们的抗疫经验,组织编写26种语言的《新冠肺炎防治手册》,与全球200多个国家和地区共享,在线阅读和下载量突破160万,为全球抗疫提供了浙江大学医学院附属第一医院方案。这次新冠肺炎疫情对社会和各行业造成了巨大深远的影响,我们对这次疫情防治和救治工作进行了一些总结和思考,收获了一些启发。作为国家传染病医学中心的建设医院,我们在牵头建设浙江省公共临床卫生中心,助推完善国家省市县级传染病救助网络。此外,我们积极推动重大传染病的研究攻关,提升疾病防控和治疗能力,与疾控部门合作提升传染病的预警监测能力,将开展重大疫情疾病应急物资的储备、平战结合、平疫结合疫情防控模式的研究。我们有信心通过强化业务指导、创新科学研究,在传染病救治体系建设和能力提升上有所发展,推动全省乃至全国公共卫生事业的发展。谢谢。米锋​:谢谢,今天发布会的几位嘉宾为我们介绍了浙江“十三五”期间卫生健康事业的发展变化,特别是这期间人民群众的健康获得感。近期,我们还将继续邀请北京医院、北京协和医院、中日友好医院等几家大型医疗机构来参加我们的发布会,介绍医疗机构在“十三五”期间的发展变化,欢迎大家继续关注。今天的发布会到此结束,谢谢大家!\n\n[要求]

"国家卫生健康委员会新闻发言人米锋:各位媒体朋友,大家上午好。欢迎参加国家卫生健康委“巡礼十三五·迈向全民健康这五年”专题新闻发布会。“十三五”时期,浙江省卫生健康系统在深化医改、改善医疗卫生服务、优化资源配置、提升综合服务能力等方面开展积极有益探索,加快推动卫生健康治理的现代化。“健康浙江”建设全面推进,群众健康获得感得到有效提升。今天的发布会我们将重点介绍浙江省卫生健康工作的这些工作进展和取得的积极成效。今天发布会我们请来了浙江省卫生健康委主任张平先生、杭州市卫生健康委主任孙雍容女士、浙江大学医学院附属第一医院党委书记梁廷波先生、浙江省开化县委书记鲁霞光先生,请他们共同介绍有关情况,并回答媒体提问。首先,请张平主任介绍浙江省“十三五”时期卫生健康事业发展的总体情况。浙江省卫生健康委主任张平:各位媒体朋友上午好,首先非常感谢大家长期以来对浙江卫生健康工作的关心和支持。早在2003年,时任浙江省委书记的习近平同志指出,“没有健康就没有小康;没有卫生现代化,就没有整个社会的现代化”。这些年,浙江沿着习近平总书记指引的卫生现代化之路,一张蓝图绘到底。“十三五”以来,浙江省深入贯彻新时代党的卫生健康工作方针,聚焦高质量竞争力现代化,聚力“1+5”改革发展攻坚战,卫生健康事业取得显著成就。一、坚持健康优先发展战略,高水平健康浙江建设全面推进。第一时间启动健康浙江26个专项行动,率先把区域健康发展纳入市县党政领导班子目标责任制考核,率先实现国家卫生城市(县城)全覆盖,持续提升群众健康水平。2019年,人均期望寿命达79.13岁,比2015年增加0.91岁;居民健康素养水平29.49%,高出全国平均10.32个百分点;孕产妇死亡率、婴儿死亡率分别下降到4.08/10万和1.88‰,居民主要健康指标接近或达到高收入国家水平。二、坚持以新发展理念为引领,卫生健康创新力竞争力全面提高。布局建设1个国家医学中心、7个国家区域医疗中心,落地运行中科院基础医学与肿瘤研究所,2019年三甲综合医院疑难重症患者同比增53.9%、三四级手术同比增56.5%。强化政府数字化转型,电子健康卡和电子社保(医保)卡实现“两卡融合”,县级以上医院“看病不用卡,只需一个码”,实现出生证、户口本、医保卡“多证一起办、一次都不跑”;浙江省互联网医院在线服务超1800万人次。放大综合医改集成效应,在全国三级公立医院绩效考核中,综合排名和“a++”等级医院排名均列第三。2015到2019年,个人卫生支出占卫生总费用的比重从29.5%降至25.2%;药占比从35%降至29.9%,医疗服务收入占比从27.3%升至30.7%。三、坚持重心下移、资源下沉,基层医疗卫生服务能力全面增强。作为全国县域医共体建设试点省,208家县级医院、1063家乡镇卫生院整合成161家医共体,全部由二甲以上医院牵头,打破原有层级分割,实行扁平化管理和垂直化运行,2019年乡镇卫生院门急诊、出院人次分别增长12.4%和11.3%,170家卫生院恢复或新开展一二类手术。11个设区市全部纳入国家城市医联体建设试点,市、区、街道层级清晰、功能整合的一体化运行模式有效构建。2015年到2019年,县域就诊率、基层首诊率分别从82.1%、49.9%提高到88.3%和52.7%,有序就医格局加快形成。我在这里特别要跟媒体朋友报道的是,我们现在有个非常好的现象,原来我们病人从下级医院转往上级医院的很多,但是从上级医院转往社区、转往基层去康复的不多,但是现在我们正在改变这样的局面,像今年1-9月,我们县里的医共体向下转诊达到17.9万次,平均每个县级医院向乡村卫生院下转1100多人次,打破了下转上易、上转下难的瓶颈问题。四、坚持向“看病难”“看病烦”持续发力,群众健康获得感全面提升。浙江省紧紧扭牢群众看病就医当中反映强烈的堵点痛点难点,率先启动医疗卫生服务领域“最多跑一次”改革,2018年浙江省首次推出了看病少跑腿、检查少排队等十大举措,入选全国医改十大新举措,2019年浙江省又推出新十大举措,中央深改办也专门刊发了我们的做法,今年浙江省又提出了完善公共场所服务支持措施,持续推动就医体验大提升。城市医院高峰时段排队平均时间缩短三分之二,今年原来排队平均排8.2分钟,现在排队2.61分钟,分时段就诊预约控制在30分钟以内,平均住院日从8.6天下降到6.9天。常态化推进民生实事,每年推出一批健康惠民新项目纳入浙江省政府十方面民生实事,像今年的3岁以下婴幼儿照护服务机构和托位建设,还为70岁以上老年人免费接种流感疫苗,对高危人群进行大肠癌免费筛查,这些民生项目都获得了很好的社会效益,也收获了群众很好的口碑。比如今年浙江省对高危人群的大肠癌筛查,一共筛查了12.5万人,其中筛查出大肠癌的,大肠癌癌前病变和良性病变的检出率分别是0.83%、8.15%和36.2%,通过数据分析,仅仅这个项目应该说不仅救治了1000多名患者,还挽救了有可能罹患大病重病的5.5万个家庭,如果统计一下,按照大肠癌患者的每个均例费用大概是17.3万元,也就是罹患大肠癌以后住院、治疗、手术、放疗,大肠癌癌前病变的治疗费用,每一笔大概是2.4万,仅这么一个民生项目,就可以节省群众的医药费用、减轻群众的负担,或者为医保节约费用28亿多元,所以群众反映的,更多的减少了罹患大病家庭的痛苦。五、坚持全方位保障人民健康,公共卫生体系建设全面加强。强化预防为主,突出中西医并重,落地“两员一中心一团队”机制,这个“两员一中心一团队”机制主要是落实在县域医共体,加强基层的预防保健工作、医防协同工作。浙江省启动了高血压、糖尿病“两慢病”全周期健康管理。2019年全省甲、乙类传染病总报告发病率降至175.02/10万,重大慢病过早死亡率下降至9.04%。面对突出其来的新冠肺炎疫情,浙江省率先启动“一级响应”,坚决做到“外防输入、内防扩散”,不断提升防控和救治能力。目前,疫情防控的精密智控指数已经升级到6.0版本,在国务院第七次大督查中,浙江省的做法也得到了通报表扬。到今天来计算的话,已经连续189天无新增确诊的本地病例报告。下一步,浙江将深入贯彻党的十九届五中全会精神,紧扣忠实践行“八八战略”,奋力打造重要窗口的主题主线,力争率先实现卫生健康现代化,为建成健康中国提供浙江方案。谢谢大家。米锋:谢谢张平主任,下面进入今天现场提问环节,请各位记者朋友围绕今天的发布主题进行提问,提问前请通报所在的新闻机构。新华社记者:党的十九届五中全会提出要加快优质医疗资源扩容和区域均衡布局,请问浙江在这方面作出了哪些实践?谢谢。张平:这个问题非常好。十九届五中全会,大家都非常关注一句话,“推动优质医疗资源扩容和区域均衡布局”,我认为这实际上是医疗服务供给侧改革的重要内容。这几年浙江在这方面做了一些探索和实践,也取得了比较好的成效。具体来说主要做了三件事:第一,实施“双下沉、两提升”工程。就是通过省市三级医院的技术下沉和管理下沉,来提升县级医院的医疗技术水平和管理水平,实现从城市医院强到县级医院强的发展。浙江省54家城市三级医院与122家县级医院建立了紧密型的合作关系,县级医院的整体服务能力通过“双下沉、两提升”得到了明显提升。比如说县级医院的手术台次数年均增长15%,浙江省的所有县级综合医院都能够开展胃肠手术,整体实力得到大大加强,县级医院的龙头学科达到166个。第二,全力推进县域医共体建设。我刚才也向各位媒体朋友作了介绍,医共体的目的是要使我们县级医院的技术和服务延伸到乡镇和基层,实现从县级医院强到整个县域医疗卫生服务强的目的。全省共组建161个医共体,这161个医共体是完全按照一家人、一本账和一盘棋的体制机制进行运行的,在人财物方面实行一体化管理。目前,浙江省平均每天有将近5000名的县级医院医生是在乡镇卫生院进行定期的排班工作,也许今天这个岗位在县级医院手术,明天这个县级医院医生的岗位就是在乡镇卫生院看门诊,我们叫做“业务垂直化、管理扁平化”。现在全省是95.7%的乡镇卫生院能够开展门诊手术,89%的乡镇卫生院的门急诊人次增幅要高于我们县级医院的门急诊人次的增幅。我刚才跟大家介绍,这是一个非常可喜的现象,群众更多是选择在基层看病、在家门口看病,而不要舟车劳顿跑到县里甚至市里、省里看病,这是一个非常重要的改革。我们是希望群众在家门口能够看得上病、看得好病成为现实。第三,全省聚力打造医学高峰。浙江省以国家医学中心和国家区域医疗中心为重点,以大型三甲医院为载体,以重大项目为抓手,浙江省财政三年共安排50亿专项资金,用于医学高峰的建设,也是发挥我们集中力量办大事的制度优势,来加快浙江省优质医疗资源的扩充和扩容。近两年来共引育国家级医学人才55名,目前浙江省国家级医学人才达到285名,全国百强学科数也已经增加到212个,有51个专科列入国家临床重点专科的建设项目。我们通过这三件事,促进优质医疗资源扩容,壮大优质医疗资源,通过“双下沉、两提升”,通过县域医共体使优质医疗资源实现梯次分布、均衡分布。下一步,这也是在编制“十四五”规划当中,在配置医疗卫生资源过程中要重点关注和重点推动的一项工作。谢谢。香港中评社记者:破解看病贵,问题关键是推进医保支付方式改革,请问浙江省开化县在县域内怎样发挥医保基金的调节和杠杆作用,降低群众就医负担的?浙江省开化县委书记鲁霞光:感谢这位记者朋友的提问。浙江开化县重点突出“定、分、合、管”四个关键字,来实施总额预算管理下的多元复合支付方式改革,有效地降低群众的就医负担。“定”就是定总额,以上一年度的医保基金决算总额为基础,确定下一年度的医保基金的预算。近两年来,全县的医保基金按年增长10%来确定,比如说2019年和2020年,结算的总额分别增支三千万和四千万的额度。“分”分蛋糕,将全县的医保资金总盘子按照服务体量、人均基金的支付水平分给全县的两家医共体,县人民医院总院、县中医院总院,并实现总额预付、结余留用、超支合理分担的激励约束机制,倒逼医共体通过吸引群众县内就医,避免重复检查等方式来控费,实现群众看病省钱,基金支出下降,医院服务提升。这里有个数据,今年以来,全县职工的医保和居民医保支出同比分别下降1.88个百分点和3.84个百分点。“合”强合力,开化县通过实现医保差异化报销政策,实施百名医生进百村、健康巡诊等机制措施,合理促进分级诊疗。比如说群众在乡镇的医疗机构的住院报销比例就在县一级医院,比例要高10%。家庭医生签约患者还可以在这样一个比例基础上再提升3%。群众在家门口看病是实实在在费用下降了,得到实惠了。解决了大医院门庭若市,乡镇医院门可罗雀的现象。今年以来全县乡镇的住院人次较医共体改革前增长了138.5%,向下转诊率显著提升。“管”严监管,通过开发医保智慧监管和聘请第三方的专业稽查,来精准排查并处置有可能发生的医保套高、分解入院等违规行为和重复检查等不规范诊疗行为,严控不合理的收费现象来切实地降低群众就医支出。谢谢。《人民周刊》记者:我们知道2022年第十九届亚运会将在杭州举行,想请杭州市卫健委孙主任介绍一下在服务健康亚运的安保方面做了哪些工作。谢谢。杭州市卫生健康委主任孙雍容:谢谢媒体朋友的提问。2022年杭州市将举办亚运会和亚残运会,应该说体育健身锻炼是增进人民健康的最主要一种方法,同时亚运赛事的举办也是提升一个城市健康水平的主要途径。杭州市按照“办好一个会、提升一座城”的目标,实现了体育盛事的举办筹办、健康城市的发展和人民健康素质的提升协同推进。在亚运会的筹办过程中,我们努力实现健康资源的共享,把亚运的健康城市建设作为杭州市推进亚运筹备工作的首要工作。同时,杭州市2020年举办了1200多场次的健康健身培训,举办1500多场体育赛事,推进了36个公共场所体育健身服务场馆的服务大提升,新增了社区多功能的公共运动场23个,增加了百姓健身场馆177个,全面的实施亚运的八项行动。我们努力让健康的服务质量提升,通过筹办启动了国际化医院的创建工作,同时在“城市大脑”舒心就医,实现救护车“一键护航”的应用场景,并立法推动aed在公共场所的使用,杭州的36个比赛场馆和8个训练场馆当中还增设了母婴设施和大力推进残疾人的无障碍设施的建设。这一系列的举措既为亚运会和亚残运会做好准备,同时也提升了一座城市的温度。另外,我们努力守护这座城市的健康环境,围绕杭州的“数智杭州·宜居天堂”的目标,通过实施“迎亚运”的城市市容市貌提升、环境质量提升、城乡公共厕所管理质量的提升、垃圾分类、市民健康生活方式提升等迎亚运的一系列行动,让市民在喜迎亚运的同时也共享青山绿水的健康环境。谢谢。凤凰网记者:刚才张平主任所说浙江省启动了医学高峰建设计划,浙江大学医学院附属第一医院作为牵头医院,请问咱们医院的建设以及成效如何?医学高峰建设计划如何推动区域医疗水平提升,更好地服务百姓、惠及百姓?谢谢。浙江大学医学院附属第一医院党委书记梁廷波:谢谢你的提问。浙江大学医学院附属第一医院作为浙江省打造医学高峰的重点医院,深切感受到了浙江省委、省政府打造医学高峰的决心,通过项目支持、资金支持、政策支持几个方面,为医院高质量发展起到了积极推动作用。在医学高峰建设牵引下,医院紧扣高质量发展要求,学科建设各项工作对标国际一流,进一步明确了建设路径,强化推进引人、育才等工作,在以下几个方面取得了成效:第一,人才汇聚效应迅速的展现。2019年至今,医院共引进海外高层次人才为代表的顶尖人才32名,本土培育的国家级人才8名,预计两年内浙江大学医学院附属第一医院专职科研人才可以达到10%的比例。累计签订国家级重大重点课题18项,牵头全球多中心临床研究22项,获得国家专利66项,发表高质量论文40篇,展现了蓬勃创新活力。第二,高峰学科优势不断拓展。医院拥有完整的大器官移植学科群,截至目前,浙江大学医学院附属第一医院已经完成肝移植总数超过4000例,肾脏移植超过了7000例,小肠移植超过40例。就今年来说,小肠移植已经达到了22例,列全球第一。肝脏移植已经达到419例,列全国第二,肾脏移植达到了438例,连续十年进入全国前三。心脏移植和肺脏移植及多器官联合移植在浙江大学医学院附属第一医院也是常规的广泛开展,浙江大学医学院附属第一医院是目前国内开展大器官移植门类最全的医院,所以说无论在移植数量、移植质量和种类上,都达到了国际领先水平。传染病科在h7n9、禽流感疫情、新冠肺炎疫情等重大公共卫生事件中开展了病原溯源分离疫苗的研发、诊疗方案的制定,充分展现了传染病中心的“领头雁”的作用,代表了传染病国家的防治能力。第三,综合实力与行业影响力持续攀高。2020年,国家三级公立医院绩效考核,浙江大学医学院附属第一医院名列全国1%,stem排行榜进入了全国前三,复旦排行榜连续多年名列国内前茅,普通外科、血液科、肾脏病科、临床药学等多个学科进入全国前五或者前十。在带动区域整体提升方面,我们做了很多探索工作,通过构建紧密型医联体,构筑城市的医联体,织密远程医疗协作网,成立专科联盟等不同方式先后与省内外86家县级市级医院建立多种协作关系。“十三五”期间总计向托管医院派驻医护人员5000人次。特别是这两年来在全国推行了“小黄人”公益计划,一年来共实施200例儿童肝移植,患者来自西部贫困地区的11个省74个县,其中贫困县、极度贫困县占了4.8%,200个家庭避免了因病致贫、因病返贫的问题,与全国15个省建立帮扶合作关系,极大提升了全国儿童中末期肝病的诊治能力,这是践行大型公立医院初心使命跨地区、跨省份助力脱贫攻坚,践行习近平总书记“健康中国”“以人民健康为中心”指示的具体实践。谢谢。《中国青年报》记者:全国卫生与健康大会上提出,要推动将健康融入所有政策,把全生命周期健康管理理念贯穿城市规划、建设、管理的全过程、各环节。请问杭州在推动将健康融入所有政策方面可以给群众带来哪些实实在在的红利?谢谢。孙雍容:谢谢这位媒体记者的提问。将健康融入所有政策是落实“健康中国”战略的重要举措,也是贯彻落实浙江“健康浙江”26项行动的具体举措。近年来,杭州在努力推进将健康融入城市规划、城市管理、公共政策,比如说城市的空间规划、部门职责等方面,较早开展了公共政策健康影响的评价工作。在杭州市新一轮的城市空间规划提升政策里面,我们提出了对道路的等级设置、绿地的布局,减少意外伤害、促进呼吸健康、公共健身设施的配置等方面提出了大量健康建议,规划部门全部采纳。2020年杭州新增了绿道501.37公里,至此杭州拥有绿道3713公里,杭州市区的居民实现5分钟可达绿道的网络。实施杭州淳安特别生态功能区建设的实施意见当中,我们提出了前瞻性的健康评估,提出城市发展均等化,促进弱势群体健康公平的建议,也得到了采纳。在淳安有个很知名的千岛湖引水工程,我们提出建立风险化合物的清单、完善农村污水处理设施等建议。2020年9月,淳安千岛湖饮水工程正式启用,杭州市民饮用到了安全有品质的饮用水,水质得到了极大提升。所以说,公共政策影响的评价实施改善了杭州市的健康环境,提升了居民的健康素质,也引导了市民的健康行为。杭州市经常参加体育锻炼的人口明显增加,居民的健康素养比例达到34.9%。应该说健康理念已经深入人心,健康习惯也蔚然成风。谢谢。红星新闻记者:共建共享全民健康是建设健康中国的战略主题,杭州是全国健康城市试点城市,健康城市不同于传统的卫生城市,杭州在健康城市创建过程中有哪些方面提升最为明显?市民从中有哪些获益?五年来,“健康杭州”建设是如何实现全民健康共治,推进健康治理能力现代化的?谢谢。孙雍容:谢谢你对健康杭州建设的关心关注。杭州市健康城市的建设过程是一个从全民动员到全民共享、健康共治的探索发展历程。62年前,毛主席视察了杭州小营巷的爱国卫生工作,杭州也掀起了爱国卫生运动的高潮。四年前,杭州市成为新一轮健康城市的试点城市,作为省会城市建设与“重要窗口”“名城战略”相匹配,与经济社会发展相吻合,与人民健康需求相适应的“健康杭州”已经摆在我们面前。杭州市接续推进“健康杭州”建设,健康治理的现代化水平以及“健康杭州”的社会公认度有显著提升。国内主流媒体、世界卫生组织多次给予杭州高度肯定。特别是疫情防控期间,健康码的疫情防控的应用,“城市大脑”“舒心就医”等一批创新项目在国内领先,驻企健康指导、企业健康管理员培训认证制度,未来健康屋、金牌讲师巡讲团、健康素养进农村文化礼堂等一系列的健康品牌带给了市民更多的健康体验。2019年杭州市的人均期望寿命达到82.95岁,婴幼儿死亡率和孕产妇死亡率逐步下降到千分之1.65和2.75/10万,这些指标达到发达国家水平。最近杭州市下发了《杭州市推进大健康治理现代化的实施意见》,把“健康杭州”的建设摆在更加重要位置,杭州将通过数字赋能、建立健康的共治生态体系,让人民群众有更多的健康获得感。诚挚地希望媒体朋友们关心杭州的“健康杭州”建设,助力杭州市早日实现健康治理的现代化,为健康中国、健康浙江样板出力。谢谢。中国县域卫生记者:一直以来县域医共体建设都是浙江医改的特色,此背景下我想了解开化县如何出台具体措施提升县域医共体的水平和落实“小县城也有大健康”目标的?谢谢。鲁霞光:谢谢这位记者朋友的提问。浙江开化县主要是通过打造、管理、服务、发展三个共同体来推动县域医共体改革的落地、落实、落细。第一,打造管理共同体。我们成立了县域医共体管委会,形成了党政主要领导亲自推动,各职能部门密切配合、各医疗机构协同作战的组织架构。同时整合全县的公立医疗机构,构建与县人民医院和县中医院为总院,疾控中心、妇保医院为专科联盟,乡镇卫生院整体纳入的“2+n”的医共体架构,设唯一的法定代表人,强化党建统领,实现党委下的院长负责制。自主管理医共体内部的职称业务等发展,真正从“各自为政”,变为“一家人”。第二,打造服务共同体。巩固深化县级医院与省市医院合作办医,做强县级龙头,力争大病不出县,在15个乡镇卫生院现在叫乡镇分院,全部开设全专科的联合门诊,组建120支“总院专科医生+分院签约医生+驻村医生”的家庭医生签约服务团队进村入户,确保小病不出乡。与此同时,建立覆盖全县的远程会诊,区域影像、区域心电、质量控制、临床检验等五大资源的共享中心,来贯通基层的检查、上级的诊断、区域的互认的服务链条,让老百姓愿意在家门口看病就医。这两年来,乡镇的首诊率从52.32%提升至64.05%,全县域的就诊率从81.8%提高到90.75%,应该说成效非常明显。第三,打造发展共同体。实施人员、资源、信息三统筹,财务、药械、绩效三统一的高效运行机制,力推扁平化管理、垂直化运行。同时强化医疗、医药、医保三医联动改革,我们的医保资金实现总额预算、结余留用、超支合理分担,统一打包拨付给医共体使用,变医疗收入为医院成本,倒逼医院主动控费,争取结余留用,同时建立资金拨付和绩效奖金分配体系,今年以来全县公立医院医疗总费用同比下降7.19%,乡镇分院业务量同比提高16.06%,分院的医务人员年收入增幅在10%以上,应该说成效显著。谢谢。《浙江日报》记者:开化县位于浙江省最西边,是山区县,在让老百姓看得上病、看得好病方面,开化县做了哪些努力呢?谢谢。鲁霞光:感谢你对开化的关心。正如你所说,开化是典型的山区县,地处浙江母亲河钱塘江的源头,浙皖赣三省七县的交汇处,是浙江西大门,同时也是习近平总书记点赞的“好地方”“绿水青山就是金山银山”理念的实践示范地。这些年来,我们始终牢记习近平总书记的殷切嘱托,坚定“好地方必须有好健康、小县城也要大健康”这样的目标,通过引进来、送上门、跑起来破解瓶颈难题,努力让开化县老百姓有更多获得感和幸福感。一是优质资源引进来。我们打造“双下沉、两提升”的升级版,依托浙医二院、浙江医院等城市的三甲医院,建成了康复医学、中医肾病等十多个省市特色学科。同时,通过乡贤专家驿站、中医创新驿站等平台,引进省内外的知名专家下沉帮扶。比如借乡贤回归工程开展“博士家乡行”活动,建立了16个乡贤的专家工作站,目前全县日均有10余名省市专家来开化坐诊,专家的门诊量年均2万人次。二是健康服务送上门。为了破解开化县“九山半水半分田”的区域限制,偏远山区网格不全的问题,大力实施“百医进百村健康进万家”专项行动,县级专家定期下乡轮岗一次,乡镇医生每周必须下村坐诊一天,对全县100余个还没有卫生室的行政村实现驻点服务全覆盖。同时,通过流动医院、巡回医疗车,为群众提供家门口的健康服务。比如我们针对老年人的健康状况,制作了“红黄蓝”三色的分类管理卡,三级医生定期开门精准开展健康宣教、中医保健、临床会诊等服务。这里值得一体的是,开化县财政每年拿出500万元,为全县65岁以上的高血压和2型糖尿病患者终身免费发放药物。同时为90岁以上的老年人每年免费体检一次,有效打通了健康扶贫领域当中服务困难群众的“最后一公里”。前不久我在下乡调研的过程中,有一位老人家拉着我的手说:“书记,共产党真好!我们的医生专家真好”!他打电话专门给我说,家里的高血压药不多了,过几天“百医进百村”就到我们村了,要去领免费的药。他说比我亲儿子还亲,提醒很及时。去年我们还创成了衢州市首家国家级的慢性病综合防控示范区。三是医疗数据跑起来。我们还大力发展“互联网+医疗服务”,先后建立五大资源共享中心,打破健康数据的壁垒,实现互联互通、互动互享,县级专家通过远程心电、远程影像系统为乡镇分院每年年均阅片4万余分。比如乡镇拍片,乡人民医院第一时间给报告,特别是疫情一级响应期间,充分利用闭环管控、精密智控的机制,加强疫情常态化的防控,让1.6万人次就近享受远程服务,大大降低了人群聚集和流通的风险。截至目前开化县依然是全省11个疫情零病例县之一,牢牢护好了“浙西绿岛”。谢谢。中央广播电视总台央视新闻记者:我们知道浙江在大力推进卫生健康领域的数字化改革,目的是让老百姓有更好的就医体验,浙江采取了哪些措施实现这样的目标?谢谢。张平:感谢这位记者朋友的提问。互联网+医疗健康,我们理解它本质是通过数字赋能来提升我们的医疗健康服务效能。近年来,浙江省作为全国“互联网+医疗健康”的试点省,全面强化了卫生健康的数字化转型。我们目标是实现“三减一升”,减少重复办卡,减少重复排队,减少重复检查,提升管理水平。我们主要采取了几个方面的措施:一是建立省级统一预约挂号平台和互联网医院。目前已经接入全省1015家医院,注册用户超过1700万人,累计的预约量已经超过了6200万人次。我们还建成了全国首个集服务与监管一体的省级互联网医院平台。这个平台涵盖了“互联网+医疗”“互联网+药事”“互联网+护理”三大服务板块,涵盖了748家医疗机构,在今年的疫情期间,我们平均每天有3万人次接受线上医疗健康服务。二是强化业务流程再造。推进电子健康卡和电子社保卡的“两卡融合、一网通办”,让群众基于一个码就能获取预约挂号、在线取号、扫码就医、费用结算、报告查询、互联网复诊等医疗和医保服务。同时在“浙里办”的app上开通了国民医疗健康专区,整合全流程的线上就医服务,汇聚了生育登记、儿童免疫、健康证明等十余项便民服务,我们希望逐步打造掌上医疗健康服务生态圈,实际应用场景能够不断拓展。三是促进健康大数据的开放和共享。目前省级医学检查检验报告信息共享平台已经覆盖到340家县级以上医院,实现了跨地域、跨机构的诊间报告提醒和调阅,并向患者提供实时查询服务,全省共享检查检验结果已经超过2.1亿条,每日有超过3万患者可以实时查询报告。电子健康档案的开放已经覆盖到所有县市区,开放率达到54%。四是推动跨部门的业务协同应用。我们整合了卫健、公安、医保等部门的出生医学证明、预防接种证、户口登记、医保登记等多类事项,推动“出生一件事”协同办理,将办事材料精简到一份,现在新生儿出生各种证明办理只要提供一份材料就可以。原来十多个环节,现在只要一个环节就可以。时间也是平均压缩到3天内就可以全部办完,实现一次提交、多证联办、一站送达,目前已覆盖了全省所有县级以上的有助产服务的医疗机构。月均掌上联办量超过1万,每年惠及40多万新生儿家庭。五是创新精密智控服务与监管。浙江省通过推进“互联网+医疗服务”,实现了医院服务窗口从人工向自助机再向移动端的迈进,“互联网+医疗监管”实现了医疗过程的实时智能全程监管,特别是针对疫情防控的需要,我们建立了浙江省精密智控疫情防控智慧调度平台,健全多点出发的监测预警机制,推动多部门多层级的协同联动和高效响应。这个指挥平台也为浙江省实现“两手硬、两战赢”发挥了很重要的作用。谢谢。《健康报》记者:浙江大学医学院附属第一医院作为国家传染病医学中心,在这次抗疫过程中做了大量工作,咱们有什么感受和体会?下一步推进区域突发公共卫生事件建设体系的过程中咱们有什么想法?谢谢。梁廷波:谢谢这位记者朋友的提问。新冠肺炎疫情对国家是一个大考,对我们浙大医院所有的公立医院也是一场考验,我们坚持统一指挥、统一作战,在坚守浙江抗疫主战场的同时,为国内战场和国外战场也贡献了浙江大学医学院附属第一医院力量。第一,坚决落实“四个集中”的模式,迅速建成了主战场。作为浙江省危重患者集中的收治中心,建立落实集中患者、集中专家、集中资源、集中救治的原则,用12小时全面启动了浙江院区的隔离病房,用24小时全面转入了所有的确诊和疑似病例,72小时内完成了之江院区整个医院的改造,充分体现了医院党委守土有责、守土负责、守土尽责的使命,全院共收治105例的确诊患者中,重症和危重症占八成,危重患者34例,占全省95%以上。第二,实现“一人一策”的创新多学科诊治模式。在之江院区,我们集结了15个学科团队,医护人员超过700人,每天进行mdt多学科讨论会诊,制定精细化诊治方案,成功完成了全球首两例老年新冠肺炎的肺移植,一例新冠肺炎孕妇平安产子,一位96岁的高龄老人经过治疗后顺利康复,最终实现了105例患者的“零死亡”、实现我们所有疑似病人的“零漏诊”、医护人员“零感染”的“三个零”目标。第三,国内国际合力抗疫,分享浙江大学医学院附属第一医院新冠肺炎抗疫经验。我们牵头制定了新冠肺炎诊疗方案的浙江临床经验版,选派了多批专家赴各地会诊疑难病例,指导疫情防控,派出四批次152人驰援武汉,派出7人专家组赴意大利,直接连线五大洲50多个国家地区分享我们的抗疫经验,组织编写26种语言的《新冠肺炎防治手册》,与全球200多个国家和地区共享,在线阅读和下载量突破160万,为全球抗疫提供了浙江大学医学院附属第一医院方案。这次新冠肺炎疫情对社会和各行业造成了巨大深远的影响,我们对这次疫情防治和救治工作进行了一些总结和思考,收获了一些启发。作为国家传染病医学中心的建设医院,我们在牵头建设浙江省公共临床卫生中心,助推完善国家省市县级传染病救助网络。此外,我们积极推动重大传染病的研究攻关,提升疾病防控和治疗能力,与疾控部门合作提升传染病的预警监测能力,将开展重大疫情疾病应急物资的储备、平战结合、平疫结合疫情防控模式的研究。我们有信心通过强化业务指导、创新科学研究,在传染病救治体系建设和能力提升上有所发展,推动全省乃至全国公共卫生事业的发展。谢谢。米锋​:谢谢,今天发布会的几位嘉宾为我们介绍了浙江“十三五”期间卫生健康事业的发展变化,特别是这期间人民群众的健康获得感。近期,我们还将继续邀请北京医院、北京协和医院、中日友好医院等几家大型医疗机构来参加我们的发布会,介绍医疗机构在“十三五”期间的发展变化,欢迎大家继续关注。今天的发布会到此结束,谢谢大家!"}

A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks\n  (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may\n  be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and\n  anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an\n  economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum\n  (~Dec.1992).\n\n  An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus\n  <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the\n  cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to\n  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:\n\n    ::\n    command: help\n    \n    user@host\n\n  where `user@host' is your email address.\n \n  \n_____\n<5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?\n\n  These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,\n  especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past\n  a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as\n  breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most\n  internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a\n  ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,\n  curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a\n  system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and\n  patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also\n  the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.\n \n \n_____\n<5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?\n\n  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:\n\n  > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were\n  > more of it.

Cypherpunks know that people\n  > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,\n  > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek\n  > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or\n  > their opinions.\n\n  See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.\n\n  See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary\n  in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.\n\n_____\n<5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?\n\n  Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the\n  techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication\n  but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. \n  Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the\n  proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible\n  to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,\n  typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is\n  posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually\n  untraceable  communication can take place between sender and\n  receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic\n  realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where\n  individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual\n  users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An\n  anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman\n  (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to\n  <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following\n  commands in the subject line:\n\n    subscribe\n    unsubscribe\n    help\n\n_____\n<5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?\n\n  `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain\n  protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information\n  or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make\n  public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade\n  `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be\n  concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in\n  operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that\n  some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious\n  because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This\n  argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet\n  posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a\n  very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at\n  worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ\n  for alt.security.  \n  \n  Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic\n  Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First\n  International Symposium on National Security & National\n  Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:\n\n  > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep\n  > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's\n  > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If\n  > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there\n  > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I\n  > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into\n  > an environment where any information which is at all interesting\n  > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little\n  > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,\n  > but you may differ...\n\n_____\n<5.6> What are `identity daemons'?\n  \n  RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to\n  query a remote user's login name after connection to a local\n  communication socket (a connection of this type is established\n  during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not\n  widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement\n  it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to\n  anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system\n  adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a\n  trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.\n\n_____\n<5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?\n\n\n  Remailing/Posting\n  -----------------\n  \n  - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,\n    publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.\n  - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET\n    postings.\n  - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information\n    obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,\n    encrypted addresses, etc.)\n  - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and\n    remailer site chaining.\n  \n  General\n  -------\n  \n  - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy\n    shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the\n    general public and their governments.\n  - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies \n    by systems designers into\n    hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'\n    `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.\n  - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than\n    wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement\n    agencies.\n  - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government\n    agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to\n    strengthening and protecting it.\n\n\nISSUES\n======\n\n_____\n<6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?\n\n  From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:\n\n  > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic\n  > media which connect us.

The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,\n  Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation\n  against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other\n  U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation\n  on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,\n  NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in\n  Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on\n  Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to\n  testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and\n  caller identification.\n\n  CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available\n  via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising\n  the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For\n  more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions\n  here.)\n\n_____\n<6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?\n\n  In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies\n  on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in\n  such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.\n  \n  (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):\n\n  > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May\n  > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card\n  > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success. \n  > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying\n  > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of\n  > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some\n  > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department\n  > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide\n  > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of\n  > jurisdictions.\n\n  Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated\n  instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a\n  crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal\n  search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of\n  Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST\n  by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science\n  Fiction Magazine:\n\n  > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional\n  > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the\n  > SJG office.

Yet Jackson and his business were not only\n  > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place. \n  > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that\n  > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document\n  > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.\n\n  FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed\n  on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier\n  Foundation.

Send email to\n  cypherpunks-request@toad.com to be added or subtracted from the\n  list. From the charter:\n\n  > The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption.\n  > To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt\n  > with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for\n  > privacy.

It's written in PERL, and is\n  relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).\n  Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and\n  modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are\n  amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites\n  become operational. Address all points in the section\n  ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to\n  advertising your service.  You should be committed to the long-term\n  stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.\n\n_____\n<4.8> What are references on privacy in email?\n\n\n  Brown, Bob. ``EMA Urges Users to Adopt Policy on E-mail Privacy.''  \n  Network World (Oct 29, 1990), 7.44: 2.\n  \n  Bairstow, Jeffrey. ``Who Reads your Electronic Mail?''

For more\n  information send email to crosslink@athena.mit.edu.\n\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n=============\n\n_____\n<5.1> What is ``digital cash''?\n\n  With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the\n  possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be\n  realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks\n  (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may\n  be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and\n  anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an\n  economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum\n  (~Dec.1992).\n\n  An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus\n  <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the\n  cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to\n  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:\n\n    ::\n    command: help\n    \n    user@host\n\n  where `user@host' is your email address.\n \n  \n_____\n<5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?\n\n  These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,\n  especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past\n  a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as\n  breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most\n  internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a\n  ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,\n  curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a\n  system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and\n  patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also\n  the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.\n \n \n_____\n<5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?\n\n  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:\n\n  > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were\n  > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy\n  > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,\n  > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant\n  > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people\n  > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,\n  > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek\n  > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or\n  > their opinions.\n\n  See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.\n\n  See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary\n  in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.\n\n_____\n<5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?\n\n  Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the\n  techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication\n  but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. \n  Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the\n  proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible\n  to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,\n  typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is\n  posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually\n  untraceable  communication can take place between sender and\n  receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic\n  realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where\n  individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual\n  users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An\n  anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman\n  (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to\n  <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following\n  commands in the subject line:\n\n    subscribe\n    unsubscribe\n    help\n\n_____\n<5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?\n\n  `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain\n  protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information\n  or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make\n  public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade\n  `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be\n  concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in\n  operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that\n  some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious\n  because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This\n  argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet\n  posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a\n  very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at\n  worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ\n  for alt.security.  \n  \n  Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic\n  Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First\n  International Symposium on National Security & National\n  Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:\n\n  > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep\n  > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's\n  > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If\n  > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there\n  > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I\n  > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into\n  > an environment where any information which is at all interesting\n  > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little\n  > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,\n  > but you may differ...\n\n_____\n<5.6> What are `identity daemons'?\n  \n  RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to\n  query a remote user's login name after connection to a local\n  communication socket (a connection of this type is established\n  during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not\n  widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement\n  it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to\n  anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system\n  adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a\n  trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.\n\n_____\n<5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?\n\n\n  Remailing/Posting\n  -----------------\n  \n  - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,\n    publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.\n  - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET\n    postings.\n  - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information\n    obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,\n    encrypted addresses, etc.)\n  - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and\n    remailer site chaining.\n  \n  General\n  -------\n  \n  - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy\n    shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the\n    general public and their governments.\n  - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies \n    by systems designers into\n    hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'\n    `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.\n  - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than\n    wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement\n    agencies.\n  - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government\n    agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to\n    strengthening and protecting it.\n\n\nISSUES\n======\n\n_____\n<6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?\n\n  From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:\n\n  > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic\n  > media which connect us.

The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,\n  Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation\n  against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other\n  U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation\n  on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,\n  NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in\n  Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on\n  Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to\n  testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and\n  caller identification.\n\n  CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available\n  via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising\n  the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For\n  more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions\n  here.)\n\n_____\n<6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?\n\n  In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies\n  on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in\n  such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.\n  \n  (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):\n\n  > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May\n  > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card\n  > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success. \n  > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying\n  > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of\n  > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some\n  > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department\n  > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide\n  > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of\n  > jurisdictions.\n\n  Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated\n  instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a\n  crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal\n  search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of\n  Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST\n  by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science\n  Fiction Magazine:\n\n  > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional\n  > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the\n  > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared\n  > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,\n  > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin\n  > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only\n  > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place. \n  > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that\n  > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document\n  > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.\n\n  FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed\n  on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier\n  Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe\n  Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:\n  \n  > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret\n  > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal\n  > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a\n  > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,\n  > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment. \n  > \n  > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in\n  > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,\n  > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke\n  > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer\n  > seizure policies.

Indeed, agents testified that\n  > they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the\n  > special Secret Service school on computer crime. \n  > \n  > \"How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what\n  > Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?\" asked Sparks. \"An hour? \n  > \n  > \"Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to\n  > Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything\n  > taken? \n  > \n  > \"Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had\n  > a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen\n  > -- saying he was a computer crime suspect? \n  > \n  > \"Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material\n  > could harm Steve Jackson economically?\" \n  > \n  > Foley replied, \"No, sir,\" but the judge offered his own answer. \n  > \n  > \"You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go\n  > out and hire a lawyer and sue you.\" \n  > \n  > More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier \n  > Foundation in bringing the case to trial.

no ? okay . thank you . item 2 this morning , then , is a further session on our follow-up on our 'mind over matter ' report . i 'm very pleased to welcome carol shillabeer , who is chief executive of powys teaching health board , and who manages the together for children and young people programme . thank you very much for attending , and thank you for the written update that you provided in advance to the committee . we 've got a lot of ground that we want to cover this morning , so if it 's okay we 'll go straight into questions . if i can just start and ask you if you 're satisfied with the progress that 's been made since the programme was established in 2015 . carol shillabeer : thank you very much for that question , chair . i 've got to say 'yes ' , in many regards . so , the key focus of the programme in the early stages was about improving access to specialist child and adolescent mental health services . we developed the windscreen model—or we lifted the windscreen model . other models that are very similar have been talked about as well , and our big focus was on ensuring that we could make immediate progress around access to specialist camhs . it 's some years ago now since this committee did the original report , and obviously healthcare inspectorate wales and the wales audit office had done reports in the past , and i think there was a need for a programme that could focus on action . you 'll see in the written update that we covered quite a large number of areas , and so therefore had to make a prioritisation . the prioritisation was at the specialist camhs end . we have provided the committee with a red , amber or green rating of where we feel that we were , and that was just before submission of the evidence . overall i would say we have made progress . i recognise you recognise that in your 'mind over matter ' report , and that is pleasing . what i would say , though , is that there 's a still a lot to be done . certainly over the last nine months or so , we 've seen a real momentum around the whole-school approach work , which we 're not actually leading now as a programme , although we facilitated the workshop held in september . but that 's got a real momentum , and the absolute priority now is the early help and enhanced support part of the work moving forward , and i 'm sure we will come on to that in more detail . but we know there is more community workforce in specialist camhs , we know we 're seeing children in a shorter time frame , and we know we 're accepting more referrals , so our indicators are telling us we are making progress . lynne neagle am : thank you . and you referred to the work on the whole-school approach , which is very welcome , and i recognise that the programme has been involved in driving that as well . but i 'm sure you 'll also recognise the emphasis that the committee has placed on this being a whole-system approach to children and young people 's mental health , and we feel very strongly that if any of the areas get out of balance , then it will jeopardise the progress in other parts of the programme . are there any particular areas where you feel you have n't made enough progress that you 'd like to draw the committee 's attention to ? carol shillabeer : this is maybe about what the programme 's done , but really around the broader sense as well . i 'm going to be very straight and say we should have made more progress on psychological therapies . i 'm disappointed that we have n't . i 'm assured that we 've got capacity in place now and the drive in place to get the matrics cymru framework developed for children and young people . i 've had discussions with the national psychological therapies committee , who have owned this , and we 're working together more on this area . that 's not to say for one minute that health boards and local areas have n't been working on psychological therapy service provision and changing the models , but that is an area we should have made , i think , earlier progress on . there 's been a general reflection from myself and the together for children and young people programme board over the phase of the programme . i think we started very strongly ; i think we probably had a bit of a lull in the middle , if i 'm truthful about that—we had a change of personnel , and we really gathered a momentum over the last year or 18 months , and that has helped to push us from a focus on specialist camhs into that whole-school approach . but , if i could just agree with your comments about the whole system , it has to be the whole system and that 's why the real focus now on early help and enhanced support is critical . if i can just say , in case i do n't get a chance to say this later , i was delighted to see the focus on youth work yesterday , because what is clear is for that part , the early help and enhanced support , this is n't just about the nhs and it 's not just about education , it 's about every part of the system , really , which does make it more complex . but i just wanted to say that i think that youth work has perhaps not have the recognition that it 's needed and yesterday was a positive step . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . we 've got some questions now on early help and enhanced support from janet finch-saunders . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . good morning . in terms of local primary mental health support services , what is your understanding of the issues leading to some health boards not meeting the mental health ( wales ) measure 2010 targets for assessment and therapy for children and young people , and how much of this is due to an increase in demand ? carol shillabeer : yes , thanks very much . so , it 's important to say , i think , at the outset , just by way of reminder , that the target , quite rightly , changed for children and young people . the target changed some years ago for adults , so it was only right that there was an equalisation around children . so , the services were working , a couple of years ago , with significant demand and then a change in the standard . i think you 're absolutely right ; your question alludes to the fact that some health boards are struggling to maintain the full performance around seeing children , particularly within the 28 days . i would say— . and we 've had some discussion about whether the impact of the mental health measure has actually drawn perhaps some of the workforce , the staff , who would have been working at that earlier stage in local primary mental health , into a bit more of the secondary element , which is why the review being undertaken by the nhs delivery unit into primary care camhs is so critical , because , actually , if we do n't have—and i believe we do n't have—enough capacity in that part of the system , then referrals will move towards the more specialist end of this . so , i think we will have seen , by the evidence submission , that demand has increased , not just in wales but in the uk , and it has increased significantly . we are doing reasonably well at meeting that demand—so , we have more contacts , more staff , shorter access times , so that is a good news story . we 've not got it completely sustained at this stage , and therefore the focus of the delivery unit 's primary care camhs report is what more can we do in that part of the system to help to see children and young people or provide consultation and liaison to others and support people at that level of intervention . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . i know , from my own experience as a constituency am , i have families who tell me that they ca n't get into the early interventions and eventually things just become so—they end up in the more specialist ones and believe that that's— . and i do n't like to put it in resource terms , but it 's false economy in terms of the impact on the child and the family , but , obviously , in terms of cost as well . do you find that that 's a common theme across wales ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think that the thrust of that is absolutely right . so , we absolutely need to see children and families at the earliest intervention and that 's why this is a whole system , not compartmentalised . i think there have been really good attempts in a couple of areas of that greater reach out and that earlier help—hot clinics and those sorts of initiatives that help people not to get in a long queue for specialist camhs , but can be supported , often by telephone , at that earlier stage . my sense of where we go next , in terms of , you know , you talk about early help and enhanced support for all the 'missing middle ' , as you referred to it in your report , is to make sure we 've got a fully joined-up , multi-agency team approach to that . and i think that will need some resourcing to support that , yet to be fully determined . but yesterday 's announcement about youth work , the government 's commitment to primary care , camhs , et cetera—that 's all going to be very helpful to prevent those young people having to go into specialist camhs . and just a final note on that , if i may—at the beginning of the programme , we had a report from hafal called 'making sense ' and there were 10 key asks , if you like , of the system and the service from young people who had experience of the service . they said , 'please do n't medicalise it'—i 'm paraphrasing now , of course—'please do n't medicalise it ; please focus on supporting teachers and others who can support us at an earlier stage and then , when we really need help , please ensure that it is there at that more specialist level . ' that 's been a bit of a guiding principle for the programme . so , that reflects the questions that you were asking , really . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . what are the outcomes of the stakeholder workshop held last week on early help and enhanced support ? and how are the actions going to be taken forward and implemented ? and also , given that the together for children and young people programme comes to an end in october of this year , who , in your view , is best placed to forward this work stream , and what will be the biggest challenges ? it 's a bit of a long question , so , break it up however you like . carol shillabeer : that 's absolutely fine . janet finch-saunders am : and what will be the biggest challenges that they will face ? carol shillabeer : yes , i think that 's helpfully laid out in three stages . so , you 're absolutely right , there was a highly successful workshop last week really focusing on early help and enhanced support . it brought all of the agencies together , which was—and actually had a bit of a waiting list , apparently , for places . so , there was a lot of demand and a lot of interest in this . in relation to the next steps , there is a planning group reflection in early july , in terms of the outcomes of the workshop or the outputs of the workshop , and there are three commitments that have been made to this stage . one is that we develop those values-led approaches that will bring multiple agencies together to have that common purpose . the second one is to develop the ingredients for successful working in this area , and then , thirdly , to determine or propose priorities and sequencing of next steps . so , that 's the next stage of that . i 'm pretty sure we 'll come on shortly—or hopefully—to the potential of the regional partnership boards . there is some work that we are doing as a programme with the children 's commissioner in terms of working more with the regional partnership boards in taking forward this work . so , that will run alongside . but during the summer , then , we will be developing that framework approach , and we will be participating in the association of directors of social services conference in september , and then a follow-up workshop in october on this matter . on your question of 'well , what happens after the programme ? ' we are currently working on legacy arrangements for the programme . i 'm pretty secure on the specialist camhs element . that will move , most likely , to the camhs network , which is part of the nhs mental health network . i actually chair the mental health network and that 's one part of that . the whole-school approach element is already settled in government and we 've got a connection in to that . the question that 's outstanding is where the early help and enhanced support and the neurodevelopmental will go . i am currently in discussions with welsh government officials around that . i can be very clear of my own view that there needs to be a confident and clear legacy arrangement for this work . we can not afford that we 've come so far for this not now to proceed . i think there 's a huge momentum behind this . i do n't see there would be any obstacles—i hope—in getting that commitment translated into a strong approach , as we move forward . so , i 'm not in a position to say , 'and the legacy arrangements will be— ' , but i am in a position to say that i 'm having those discussions with welsh government officials . they know my view that we 've got to put something in place that is strong and secure as we move forward , and i believe that they are supportive of that . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . lynne neagle am : janet , i think those two questions have been touched on , the remaining questions . we are going to discuss in more detail the legacy arrangements , but if i could just ask on psychological therapies : you referred to the fact that you were a bit disappointed with progress in this area , and the area has n't been directly led on by the together for children and young people programme . do you think that means now that there is more of a threat to progress in this area , because , you know , we 've got different compartmentalising of actions , and this is absolutely key , is n't it , really ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think there's— . there is some refinement to be done , i think , in making sure the connections are there . so , i think , as we move to programme end , we 'll want to be absolutely assured that there are no strands left hanging , so to speak . i am confident—i mentioned the mental health network board that i chair—that we have those strands nailed down , but recognising that the early help and enhanced support and the provision of psychological support is beyond the nhs . so , this will be an area that needs to be very much seen as a key part of that . my own sense is that— . there 's been quite a lot of other developments through the life of the programme . so , in the evidence that i 've provided , you 'll see the first 1000 days , all the adverse childhood experiences work , the cymru well wales partnership , et cetera , et cetera . so , there is a bit of what i would call tidying up of the landscape to be done , and this is the ideal opportunity to do that . lynne neagle am : okay . thank you . we 've got some questions now on specialist camhs—if i can just ask about the impact of the specialist camhs framework , and how effective you feel that has been in promoting a consistent delivery of care for young people . carol shillabeer : thanks very much for that . without wanting to go back too far in history , i remember coming into this area back in 2014 as i was asked to establish a camhs network . my observation was there was n't really a strong and well-connected clinical community in this area . when we spin forward five years , i can confidently say that there is a strong and well-connected clinical community around specialist camhs . the programme has helped ; the emphasis and the focus of the programme has helped to bring people together with that more common endeavour to understand , actually , there is a good case for consistency in the main , with local variation . there has been a case for much greater learning between organisations . if i just give you an example—you 'll know that the community intensive service teams were put in place in 2015-ish . some areas have them , but a lot of areas did n't . we do have inconsistency in that , but the consistent part is there is a service now right the way across wales for more intensive support to children and young people and their families in their own homes , which helps to prevent admissions and then , where there are admissions , helps to support people to be at home . they 're all called slightly different things . so , i might have referred in my papers to citt , catt , cot and cite . so , they 've all got slightly different names and they 've got slightly different opening hours . the key thrust of this is that there is a backbone , if you like , of a consistent approach with that local variation . we have to check . so , things like frameworks for improvement—there is a coming together of the clinicians and the professionals to agree what that framework for improvement is . that then gets implemented , with some local variation . so , i think the process of moving in that way has been extremely helpful . there will be some variation . we want some variation , to some extent , as places try new things and evaluate new things . so , if i just refer to the previous question that i had , and i talked about hot clinics and different ways of reaching out ; that 's been tried in one area , been evaluated—let 's see the spread of that . so , you 'll know my view on internet counselling , for example ; i feel that is quite a strong offer for children—not necessarily in the specialist end . if that works in one area , why are n't we rolling that out to other areas ? so , i think the framework for improvement has provided a vehicle for those clinicians and professionals to come together . it 's in a stronger place—a much stronger place—than it was five years ago . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . you 've referred to there being some inconsistencies in terms of crisis care , but are you able to assure the committee that all young people are now getting at least a consistent service , especially in terms of interventions in the instances of young people self-harming . wherever you live in wales , is that help there for you now ? carol shillabeer : well , in your work to produce the 'mind over matter ' report , i clearly listened to the views from the police and the recommendations in relation to the police . we 've taken that as a further piece of work under the specialist camhs umbrella , to truly understand what the experiences of the police are and what some of the root issues may be in relation to that . for example , is it that because the cit , cat , cot , cite—the community intensive service—closes at 10 o'clock in a certain area , that actually it 's after that that the network of support is n't as strong , and , if that is the case , what are we going to do about that ? there 's certainly potential in working more regionally or even working between adults ' and children 's in terms of the crisis resolution services that work beyond those hours . so , we are taking an extra look at this , because i could not be 100 per cent confident that , throughout the 24-hour period , we 've got this fully settled . i continue to hear some stories from the police that they are picking up young people and feeling that they 've not got that solid place to go , and we 're following those through . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . we 've got some questions now from hefin david on neurodevelopmental services . hefin david am : i think , chair , i should have declared an interest here , as my daughter has been diagnosed with autism and is currently going through the process of receiving neurodevelopmental speech and language support particularly . we 're seeing an increase in neurodevelopmental referrals , and that will increase further in the future . can you give us an explanation as to why this demand is growing and how we 're going to meet capacity to deliver and for support for those children ? carol shillabeer : thank you . they 're very big questions in terms of 'why ' . i 'm not sure that anyone really knows why , if i 'm honest , although there is a lot of academic research going on . what we do know is that we are starting to see the scale of those referrals coming through . so , in the information provided , i refer to the nhs digital prevalence report in england , which indicates that about 5.5 per cent of two to four-year-olds have a mental disorder . now , that sounds a bit shocking when we say that , but that 's in the international classification scaling , and , of that , certainly , 2.5 per cent is around autism . i can just testify , in real life , that demand is absolutely growing . so , if i just take my own health board for a moment , we usually have about 75 referrals per year . last year we had 300 . so , that has felt very difficult to manage . if i can just give you a sense of what we 've done so far and then what i think is next , i want to recognise the work of dr cath norton and the steering group that 's been established on neurodevelopmental issues under the programme . they had a standing start . they 've done a lot of very , very good work . we now have seven teams in place across wales . we now have a national pathway . we now have a community-of-practice-type environment , and we 're really getting into this . good progress has been made . more people have been seen . more people have been assessed . so , we have made progress . but i 've got a long list of considerations that i think respond to your question . one is that most referrals that come through , the clinicians tell me , are seeking support to move through what they perceive to be a gateway for educational support . so , that is often the reason why people come . now , that is obviously going to be linked to the whole-school approach and how we can support that . demand is outstripping supply . so , our clinical teams are concerned about how do they keep up . so , if i just take my own example of 300 in the last year , we 're looking to try and put some additional capacity in to support seeing those families , but also then to understand what the long-term trajectory is going to be . because we 've put these teams in , because we 've got the new pathway , has that opened a gate and we 've got a lot of backlog or is that the pattern ? hefin david am : can i just ask a question there ? so , with regard to the 75 to 300 increase—in the space of a year was that ? carol shillabeer : in a year , yes . hefin david am : did you anticipate that or was that something that just came totally unexpected ? carol shillabeer : i think we anticipated a few more , and just to say that in my— hefin david am : but not on that scale . carol shillabeer : no , not on that scale . and in my own health board—i 'm just referring to my own , and i 'm happy to share the information on this—we already had a service in place . so , it was n't as if we had nothing in place previously . we had a nice-compliant service already in place , but we knew we needed to expand that , which we have done , but we did n't anticipate 300 . so , this is happening not just across wales , actually , but across the uk—so , this greater recognition , the desire for families coming forward to access that support and them seeing this as a route , which is really important . what i would also say , and this is part of the bigger picture that we need to consider going forward , is that only about 40 per cent to 50 per cent of those families that come forward have what i would call or the clinicians would call a diagnosis—so , a threshold or whatever term you want to use that takes people through to that educational support . so , we 've got a lot of people who are under that threshold , but that 's a lot of people who still need help and support . i 'm trying to very fairly and , i hope , appropriately represent the very strong views coming from the group—the workstream under the programme . we 've got to tackle all of that . it 's not going to be good enough for us just to focus our attention on those children and young people and their families who reach a threshold , because there are needs elsewhere as well , and some of that will overlap with the early help and enhanced support . some of that overlaps with learning disability services . can i just mention a few more things , as i 'm on roll on neurodevelopmental ? hefin david am : it 's up to the chair . lynne neagle am : yes , go on . carol shillabeer : is that all right ? sorry , i know it 's a very long answer . there is a concern from the neurodevelopmental group to get across that whilst there has been a lot of focus on autism—and we recognise the private member 's bill—there are other neurodevelopmental presentations and there 's a real— . having the broadest view would be advised by them , and i think they 're particularly keen to understand what a future vision and what we call , say , a 'perfect world ' would look like . that 's the piece of work that we 're wanting to do now . in terms of giving advice at the end of the programme and into legacy arrangements , about what the big , big things are , we are still needing to tackle . hefin david am : i mean , i personally took a very personal decision when it came to the member 's bill on autism you were talking about—and that was the advice i received . you need to look at the wider symptoms that are presented beyond autism and other neurological conditions . so , i 'm glad you said that , because it gives me— . because i did n't vote for that bill , and i 'm glad you said that because it gives me some personal reassurance there . but what i do have concerns about is if the increase was n't anticipated to the extent that it was and that the together for children and young people programme has a duty to review capacity , after october who 's going to make sure that that capacity 's reviewed on a strategic basis ? carol shillabeer : so , i should have probably added in that we 've got a piece of work under way at the moment—welsh government commissioned it—by a person called patrick holton , and he is specifically looking at the demands on capacity in relation to neurodevelopmental . i think getting that slightly more independent view of what we think the trends are going to be over the long term will mean we can plan for the long term . we know that money 's been put into this and it has had an important impact , but we now need to be planning for the next three , five , 10 and many years beyond that . there is the integrated autism service . i think there are some conversations , when i talk about the landscape being quite busy , about the sense of where this links as we support people through their lives with a neurodevelopmental issue . so , it 's not just about a childhood thing ; as people move through , we 've got to get much better at that long-term planning . so , that piece of work is really important . we will get the report of that over the next couple of months in order for this sort of perfect-world picture that we want to try to describe to be informed by that . it also connects to the early help and enhanced support , because recognising if we just say half of the people who come for an assessment do n't meet a threshold for a certain category , that 's a lot of people who will need help and support to manage and cope with their condition and their situation . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . if we can just move on now to in-patient care , and if i can just ask you what the programme has been doing to address some of the challenges and opportunities we face in terms of camhs in-patient care , particularly in light of the restrictions that are in place in abergele and tŷ llidiard . carol shillabeer : yes , thank you very much for that question . again , quite a lot of progress has been made in the early part of the programme around in-patients , and you are very well aware of the challenges over the last year or 18 months in relation to both units . i think , certainly , there is some recovery in the position in north wales , and the programme did a peer review visit to north wales , which i think was very helpful . in terms of where the programme has been on this issue , there is some work under way , at quite an advanced stage , around the art of the possible around enhancing the scope of the services . this was quite a tricky thing to start off when you 're in a position where , actually , there 've been some restrictions , to then ask the service to think about going even further , but we really wanted to see what the art of the possible would be if we could attract the right workforce , get the right environment , et cetera , et cetera—so , that piece of work , the review of the specification about what could be possible . clearly , we work very closely with welsh health specialised services committee as the commissioner , so we do n't commission that . we neither performance manage those environments . but , if i can just say , probably the most important part of moving forward now is the longer term work between health and social care in terms of having a much more integrated and joined up approach for children . we believe there would probably be about 100 children who have experienced care in multiple settings . we have n't got that mature approach in terms of these being joined-up teams ; we 've got social care and we 've got healthcare . there is a growing appetite to do something different . there is a meeting with the children 's commissioner on 9 july to explore that . i 've previously had conversations with the chief inspector of care inspectorate wales , for example , and we have now got , i think , a consensus growing that we need to do something very different for children and young people who are in this sort of need for the future . we also know that there 've been some high-profile legal cases as well . so , we 've got to move to that step now . it has been largely successful , the work that has taken place over recent years , but not without its key challenges . lynne neagle am : thank you . and , just briefly on the new specification that whssc are developing , that will enable admissions at weekends and out of hours . how concerned should we be about that being a challenge , particularly in abergele , where staffing has been a major issue ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think we need to be very mindful of ensuring that the right workforce are in place before that gets implemented . the peer review highlighted the challenge of the physical environment , where the unit is , the challenge across north wales of the workforce . these are issues well known by the health board , by the way , so it was n't a surprise to them . but that dialogue about how do we ensure that we 've got the right workforce , because that unit , potentially , could—you know , it 's an isolated unit , and they ’ ve been risk-managing . they 've been managing the types of young people that they can take bearing in mind the workforce that they 've got available , and that 's been entirely the right thing to do . but the downside of that is it 's not as accessible as we would want . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . hefin david has got some questions on workforce now . hefin david am : yes . with regard to the increased camhs posts that have been made available between 2016 and 2018—a 62 per cent increase in camhs posts—we know that there 's likely to be labour market demand , high labour market demand , in those instances , so are the vacancy rates higher in wales than elsewhere , given the increase in those posts to be filled ? carol shillabeer : so , you 're absolutely right . there 's been quite a lot of investment , and there have been quite a lot of new recruits coming to the service . we had in the early days a situation where we were largely robbing peter to pay paul , to be quite frank . so , as new services were being developed , people would move from one part of the system to the other . so , in the early days there was little net gain . that has improved slightly , but we 're in a national context , particularly around nursing and around some specialties in medicine , of a national shortage , so this is not a quick fix . we are starting to see a greater diversity of workforce . so , if i can mention psychology assistants , for example , my own health board is employing more psychology assistants as part of a skill mix team , rather than going to where we might have been more traditionally based . we see some of that through the nhs benchmarking , particularly with england . they have more of that . we 're perhaps a little bit— hefin david am : more of what ? carol shillabeer : they have more skill mix in their workforce . we 're catching up a bit more on that now . hefin david am : just to clarify there , what you 're referring to—there are more nursing and medical staff in the wales system and more psychological staff , experts , in the uk picture . is that— ? carol shillabeer : in the england picture . so , england had a programme called iapt , which is about psychological therapies , and had therefore looked at the skill mix . some of that was— . we 've chatted to colleagues in england , trying to learn—we 're all trying to make improvements in this area , of course ; it 's a uk and international issue—what were their experiences of this psychological therapies approach . because of their vacancies they had to skill mix , and because of the money that they had available—they did n't have as much of a cash injection as perhaps we 've been able to secure . so , they skill mixed much earlier ; we 're skill mixing now . we 're using different types of roles , for example . and if i can just make a plea , really , around recognising the input of the third sector—so , it does n't always have to be an nhs-employed person to work in service provision , direct front-line service provision , and the third sector are offering a significant contribution in a number of areas of our services . and that is one that we will need to cultivate , because , to be quite frank , our recruitment challenges wo n't be solved overnight . we 've recognised that the commissioning numbers for nursing and other professionals have gone up over recent times , but , with the training time , it 's not a quick fix . hefin david am : does the workforce profile remain different , or are they starting to— ? carol shillabeer : they 're starting to come together . there is a—graph 13 in terms of the camhs profile . each year we do the nhs benchmarking , and we can see where we are compared to others , and i would expect over the next year or two that we see a bit more narrowing . hefin david am : so , if you compare a child in wales with a child in england in the last two years who 's been through this , would they have had a different experience as a result , and different clinical advice as a result , or is there consistency despite the difference in workforce profile ? carol shillabeer : that 's quite a big question . hand on heart , could i tell you i absolutely know the detail of that ? no , i could n't . the practice in this area is guided by national institute for health and care excellence guidance , so it 's pretty much guided . we would expect all of our practitioners to be able to work to nice guidance . when you skill mix a team , you enable the right referrals to go to the right person , so you would n't necessarily have a child or young person with particularly complex needs—well , you would match them to the right practitioner for their needs . so , it does— . and we 've seen some of that ; if i just make reference to the panel approach in gwent that 's been developed , a multi-agency panel come together , a referral comes in , it 's then about matching the right service and the right person to the needs that are being presented . so , we can be much more flexible in relation to that , and we have to be careful to use the right resource for the right person , because , if we 've got a resource that is highly specialist , we want them to be dealing with those children and young people . hefin david am : and one of the things you 're able to do—because there 's a lot about the labour market you ca n't control , but one of the things you can control is workforce development and ongoing workforce development . you 've mentioned communities of practice . what other things are being done in addition , and how do the communities of practice work might be a good question , but what else is being done in order to upskill and develop and grow the existing workforce that is presented to you ? carol shillabeer : thank you for that . so , there 's a couple of things around— . i think there 's a huge focus on staff retention now , not just in wales but across the uk . so , we 've got recruitment but we 've got retention . what are the factors that affect retention ? actually , well-being , well-being at work—and you 'll know that within ' a healthier wales ' the focus on staff engagement , staff well-being , has been laid out—the ability to work well in teams and the culture of organisations and services , and , then , as you rightly say , training and development and career opportunities . so , the developments over the last few years have brought training opportunities and career development opportunities as well . i think the community of practice—it 's something that has become a bit of a standard now across these areas—actually brings people together doing collective audit , doing collective reflection on service improvement , and being very clear about learning from one another . and , if you 're a clinician , that gives you a lot of motivation to keep driving forward . so , i think we have the fundamental building blocks in place , but there is more to do around the environment in which our practitioners and our staff operate . hefin david am : what about the welsh language in the health board ? carol shillabeer : thank you very much . there are two elements , if i may , just on that . in your report of last year you highlighted the need to do further work on the use of the welsh language , and have we got enough welsh language practitioners where we need them . we are doing that piece of work . i 'm pleased to say that , over the last few years , i think all health boards have really stepped up in terms of being able to understand the levels of welsh speaking amongst employed staff and where their welsh-speaking communities are . we 're particularly looking at it in terms of in-patient camhs and community intensive services , because , particularly when people are feeling at their most vulnerable , they would choose the language they wish to choose . so , we know we need to respond to that . so , we will be in a position to , by the end of this programme , provide that position statement on what happens next . i would also say , of course , we 've got the welsh language standards that we are all working on at the moment , and we 've got a very clear programme of when we have to be compliant with those standards . so , that element is very high on the priority list . lynne neagle am : thank you . suzy davies has a question about looked-after children . suzy davies am : yes . thank you , chair . obviously , everything you 've been speaking about already , particularly about workforce development , applies to children in care as well , where there 's other work also going on in terms of support . can you give us some indication about how the programme intersects , then , with the outcomes for the children in care work programme ? carol shillabeer : thanks very much for that . so , we have one of our members of the programme board also sitting on the outcomes for children ministerial group , which is good . so , we 've got that cross-link . we also have a director of social services on our programme board and , obviously , they 're very clearly linked in to the outcomes for children . i just made reference to , under the question on specialist camhs in-patients , the need to bring those services together , and that , really , is the need for much stronger working between the outcomes for children group and the together for children and young people programme and the constituent parts . so , i 'm confident that that has been pegged now . we 've got a way forward and there is a consensus that we need to do things together on that . suzy davies am : can you just perhaps give us an example of how that then looks on the ground ? because it 's great that people are talking together , but how would that affect , i do n't know , individual members of the workforce , or , indeed , the children we 're talking about ? carol shillabeer : yes . so , if i just give an example of a unit in south wales that is a social care unit , we 've been having discussions about , 'well , actually , should n't you have a psychologist and good access to psychological therapies , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera ? ' so , we have n't yet got an agreed position on how we 're going to do this , but the position is that something needs to be done , and there is an appetite for and an understanding of the case for change , i believe . but what it will mean , i think , in practice , is that you get much more fluid roles moving across sectors , or we could be designing services that are fully integrated . now , there may be challenges in that , but , you know , let 's get them out on the table . so , in terms of this seamless health and social care system for wales , this is one of the tests of that , i would say : can we , within the next five years , 10 years , really bring that together ? that will take quite a lot of work and commitment . on the looked-after children specifically , we have picked that up , particularly following your previous report , looking specifically at the assessment of young people who are care experienced who are in the system . absolutely , part of the health assessment is emotional health and mental health . we are questioning whether that needs to be a greater part and what the level of support needs to be , particularly because of the backgrounds of children that have led them to be in those circumstances . that 's a core piece of work under the early help and enhanced support work stream , and we 'll be ensuring that that is complete by the end of the programme . suzy davies am : okay . and you 're confident that that will reach children who are being fostered and perhaps do n't have very frequent looked-after children reviews , because , from all other perspectives , things are going fairly well . carol shillabeer : yes . and , of course , there 's the edge-of-care work that the government have been supporting , and , certainly in my own area , under the regional partnership board , we have a start well programme , which is the old children and young people 's partnership programme , where there 's a significant investment in supporting children and young people , families , on the edge of care , which does pick up fostering . suzy davies am : ah , lovely . thank you . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : dawn has a question on transition . dawn bowden am : yes . thank you , chair . we 've heard , not necessarily just in the context of this report , because we 've heard similar evidence around transition arrangements in another committee report when we did the suicide prevention , and i 've in fact only recently—well , just this week , actually—met with community mental health teams in my constituency , and there is still some concern about transitional arrangements from children into adult services . now , i know we had the— . the transition guidance was published a couple of years ago now , and the programme was involved in developing that guidance . but what 's your assessment of the impact that it 's had ? because we clearly are still seeing people falling through the gaps , are n't we ? carol shillabeer : yes , thank you for that . you 're absolutely right ; we developed that guidance and we are currently in the process of the evaluation of that . and , in particular , i know that the children 's commissioner is very focused on transition , not just around children in receipt of emotional mental health support , but children in paediatric wards , and there is a working group with welsh government looking at this . the children 's commissioner has used our guidance to put that on the table to say , 'well , if this works , this needs to be considered as a model for using elsewhere ' . but the big question there is 'if ' . so , we do want to get evaluation . if i were just to give an estimate of where i think this will land , i think it will have made improvements , but there may well be some further work to do in enhancing , supporting , auditing that every child is supported in line with that guidance . so , i talked about community practice and clinical audit : is this something that we make , then , a mandatory audit , each year , that we do that double check ? because it 's one of those things where we know when a child is 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , so what 's stopping us ? if indeed the evaluation says it 's not happening everywhere , it 's not happening early enough , what is stopping us ? we really need to get underneath that . so , my sense will be it will show us , it will be better , but there 's some further work to do , and following that up in terms of audit and making sure that we 've got a systematic approach to dealing with those who have n't had the guidance fully implemented , because it can make a real difference . dawn bowden am : yes , and it seems to me—you 've just talked about having a systematic approach , and it does seem to me that it is a systematic process , is n't it ? so , it should n't be difficult . i know we 're talking about in the health service things should n't be difficult and they are , and one of the gripes—i had a meeting with the community health team—was the problems of the new it systems and so on—let 's not go there at the moment . but , really , this is just about referring children and having a smooth transition from the service being provided to them as a child and then just shifting it over to the adult services . it should n't be difficult . it 's really difficult to get my head around why that is such a problem and why that needs to be so difficult . carol shillabeer : can i add one other dimension in , which i think is going to be quite interesting ? we talk about transitions being an issue—and we know it 's not just in mental health , but it 's elsewhere—then you start to think , 'what if we could reduce transitions ? ' , so you reduce the number of transitions and you manage them better . we are doing a piece of work with government on the potential to explore what a 0-25-type service would be . we know that in different places they have approached that—in australia and places in the uk . there are probably some pros and cons , but should we be moving to a 0-25 . that is moving the transition at the age of 25 , but at least it 's not at the eighteenth birthday . what 's the argument around what adolescent , young people and young adults services are , for example ? that piece of research and understanding— dawn bowden am : you could probably have a gradual transition , then , could n't you ? carol shillabeer : quite potentially . i 've got some people who have joined my own health board who 've worked in that 0-25-type service , and we 're catching up—'tell me what was good about it ? tell me what was not so good about it ? what did the young people themselves think about that ? ' . because if we can manage down the numbers of transitions , there really should be no excuse not to get transitions right , then . dawn bowden am : okay , thank you . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : okay . we 've got some really important questions now about legacy , because throughout the session this morning you 've referred to ongoing work , really , and that is a major concern for the committee . suzy davies . suzy davies am : yes , thank you , chair , we are a little bit worried that this programme is coming to an end in a matter of months when perhaps its work 's not been completed . obviously , we 've got the welsh government 's strategy for mental health running until 2022 , which is a few years longer . can you tell me whether you think your programme needs to continue , perhaps even if it 's just for the same length of time as together for mental health , or is its work done and it needs to be picked up now by a different system ? carol shillabeer : thank you for that . can i just say , i 've given this so much thought over the time , because i think you might have asked me this question when i came previously ? there are two ways to look at this . i 'm absolutely sure that the issue of children 's emotional and mental health will be one that will be with us for a very long time . we have made a lot of progress , i think , as a society , in talking about this now . we talk about mental health so much more than we ever used to . when i was a child , we never talked about it . i talk to my own children and say , 'what 's going on in your lives at school ? ' , and they talk about this . this is not an issue , if you like , that i believe you can pick up and solve literally in five years . this is one for the long term for us . so , on the one hand , i think my view last year was that , when you have a programme of work , you should have a start , a middle and end , really—otherwise it 's not a programme of work , it 's almost forever—and there is a moment to refresh and reflect on whether that mechanism has done all it should and it should move into a different mechanism . so , my position last year was , 'this will have been running for five years—we 've done a lot of work and made progress on specialist camhs , we have made progress on the whole-school approach and there is a different mechanism for this ' et cetera . my position now is i want to just be really sure and secure that there is a strong arrangement going forward that takes this work , if this programme is going to close . suzy davies am : are you sure ? carol shillabeer : not yet . so , i think , in an earlier question i indicated dialogue going on between myself and welsh government officials . i do n't think there 's a barrier—people are n't saying , 'no , it all needs to just stop ; we 've solved the issue ' , but the exact nature of the legacy arrangements , particularly for early help and enhanced support , are not yet fully determined , or for neurodevelopmental . if it was a choice between nothing being there and continuing this programme , i would be supporting continuing the programme . i do n't think we can stop now . suzy davies am : well , i do n't think any of us would disagree with that , but i suppose there might be a level of concern that the welsh government 's preferred route from now on would be through the regional partnership boards and public services boards . you mentioned that you 've done that work in gwent , down in the south-east of your patch there . it 's quite difficult for us to try and get a picture of how that will work successfully for the whole of wales . i know you 've got your experience in gwent , but have you thought a bit more about how it might look elsewhere , if that 's the route that government decides to pursue ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think the key question in my own mind is : are the regional partnership boards yet ready and mature enough to take this forward ? i 'm the chair of the powys regional partnership board , so i should declare that . there 's a lot being asked of the regional partnership boards at the moment— suzy davies am : well , we 'll be asking them to go with the 'mind over matter ' report , to make sure that that 's delivered upon . carol shillabeer : there 's a lot , you know , ' a healthier wales'— . everyone does feel that the regional partnership boards are a route to really secure multi-agency working , so there is quite a high expectation . my understanding—and this is a rather informal understanding—is that different rpbs are in different places . so , some have retained what used to be the old children and young people partnerships , and perhaps where they have been retained , they may be in a more progressed position . some are looking to have to re-establish those . so , my sense of this is that , i think , possibly the rpbs are n't yet in that position to be ready . our piece of work on early help and enhanced support , in terms of your earlier question about what 's the commitment—that feels that that may well be another year or 18 months of development work , alongside the rpb development work , to get that ready , before we can then more confidently say where we can hand over . suzy davies am : you may not feel able to say it , then , but would be wrong in saying that , actually , it would be quite a good idea to extend the current programme , just to make sure that anyone else who might be able to run on with component parts of it is in the position to do that to our satisfaction ? carol shillabeer : i 'm happy to respond to it . my sense is that , whether it 's the programme or whether it 's something else , something needs to be there . the next stage is really multi-agency , so it may well be that the programme currently has been nhs-led—maybe it needs to be led elsewhere , maybe not . i think there 's a view that this needs to continue . i 'm less wedded to it having to be the together for children and young people programme . it may be seen as a convenient mechanism—it 's already established , we 've got a programme team et cetera , so it may be seen as a ready sort of solution . i 'm not wedded to that . what i feel strongly about is that we 've got to have the right mechanism to take it forward . suzy davies am : can i just push you on one thing there ? you mentioned , perhaps , the nhs could lead on the work , for example . is there a risk of fragmentation if we start looking— ? i 'm just thinking—i mean , we 've got the elements here : we 've got the nhs , there 's the whole-school approach , early help and enhanced support and intervention , as you mentioned earlier . if that goes to one of the players in that multi-agency approach , is there a risk that they might become too dominant , inadvertently— ? carol shillabeer : if i can just clarify—apologies if i was n't clear . i said the current programme has been nhs-led , and that might be a reason to change . suzy davies am : to mix it up a bit . oh , right , okay . anything else you want me to pursue on that— ? lynne neagle am : can i just clarify for the record , carol—because we put this to the minister last week—are you looking at asking the regional partnership boards to take this work over from october 2019 ? are you saying clearly to the committee that you do not feel that all regional partnership boards are ready for that challenge at this point ? carol shillabeer : i 'm saying that on a more , if you like it , uniformed and informal basis , we 're doing some work with the children 's commissioner now in terms of— . i know the children 's commissioner 's very interested in how rpbs are managing , developing and dealing with the issues of children and young people 's concerns . we 're working with her to understand and to mirror alongside her the understanding of the rpbs . what i would say is that there has been some preparatory work by government around supporting rpbs . so , for example , in the integrated care fund guidance last year , there was a specific reference to child and adolescent emotional mental health , which i welcomed . i 've also welcomed , literally last week , a letter to all rpb chairs giving an allocation of £200,000 per rpb to support this further work in terms of child and adolescent emotional and mental health and the early help and support element . so , all of these things are in the right direction . my sense , and i need to stress it 's a sense because we have n't done that piece of work , is different rpbs are in different places . so , how confident can we be at the october date that we could hand over ? my sense is , just to safeguard , having a mechanism in place for the next 12 to 18 months to guide this through might be advisable , and that 's what i 'm talking to officials about . lynne neagle am : and that would either be an extension of the together for children and young people programme or something else . okay , thank you . suzy davies am : thank you . because i think there is a question , is n't there , about whether the rpbs will make this enough of a priority ? i 'm a bit nervous that it might get lost in that huge amount of work you said they might have . just a final question from me : how are you establishing what the young people themselves think about the end of the programme ? are they bothered about the structure of this at all or are they just concerned that they 're getting help ? how 's the stakeholder group feeding into this ? carol shillabeer : i 've not been blown over in the rush of people saying , 'do n't go anywhere . ' [ laughter . ] it 's a really important matter for young people . i know that later on you 're meeting with the youth parliament , you 're having a joint session , which is fantastic . we 've had contact with the youth parliament because we know it 's one of their top three issues . so , it runs in the vein of that this is going to be a long-term matter for young people , i think . whether they have a specific view on the programme , i do n't know . i 've not heard that . but i 'm pretty sure they will be vocal in saying , 'we have to have these developments continue . ' it is a major issue , we 're not there yet—maybe some progress has been made but there 's still a lot to do—and i think we 'll need to be able to respond to that . suzy davies am : anything particularly you want in addition to that ? lynne neagle am : no , i think that 's fine . and if i can just say that it was really great last week at the early help and enhanced day to see young people so central to the day all the way through . it was very , very important and very welcome . suzy davies am : carol , thank you for that . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : okay . we have come to the end of our time . we had a lot of things that we wanted to cover with you . we might need to drop you a line about a couple of things that we have n't covered , but can i thank you for your attendance this morning ? as usual , you 'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting , but thank you very much for your time . carol shillabeer : thank you , all .\n\n[Requirement] The translated text must be equal to 8192 words long.", "raw_data": "lynne neagle am : good morning , everyone , and welcome to the children , young people and education committee this morning . we 've received apologies for absence from siân gwenllian and there is no substitute this morning . can i ask if members have got any declarations of interest they 'd like to make , please ? no ? okay . thank you . item 2 this morning , then , is a further session on our follow-up on our 'mind over matter ' report . i 'm very pleased to welcome carol shillabeer , who is chief executive of powys teaching health board , and who manages the together for children and young people programme . thank you very much for attending , and thank you for the written update that you provided in advance to the committee . we 've got a lot of ground that we want to cover this morning , so if it 's okay we 'll go straight into questions . if i can just start and ask you if you 're satisfied with the progress that 's been made since the programme was established in 2015 . carol shillabeer : thank you very much for that question , chair . i 've got to say 'yes ' , in many regards . so , the key focus of the programme in the early stages was about improving access to specialist child and adolescent mental health services . we developed the windscreen model—or we lifted the windscreen model . other models that are very similar have been talked about as well , and our big focus was on ensuring that we could make immediate progress around access to specialist camhs . it 's some years ago now since this committee did the original report , and obviously healthcare inspectorate wales and the wales audit office had done reports in the past , and i think there was a need for a programme that could focus on action . you 'll see in the written update that we covered quite a large number of areas , and so therefore had to make a prioritisation . the prioritisation was at the specialist camhs end . we have provided the committee with a red , amber or green rating of where we feel that we were , and that was just before submission of the evidence . overall i would say we have made progress . i recognise you recognise that in your 'mind over matter ' report , and that is pleasing . what i would say , though , is that there 's a still a lot to be done . certainly over the last nine months or so , we 've seen a real momentum around the whole-school approach work , which we 're not actually leading now as a programme , although we facilitated the workshop held in september . but that 's got a real momentum , and the absolute priority now is the early help and enhanced support part of the work moving forward , and i 'm sure we will come on to that in more detail . but we know there is more community workforce in specialist camhs , we know we 're seeing children in a shorter time frame , and we know we 're accepting more referrals , so our indicators are telling us we are making progress . lynne neagle am : thank you . and you referred to the work on the whole-school approach , which is very welcome , and i recognise that the programme has been involved in driving that as well . but i 'm sure you 'll also recognise the emphasis that the committee has placed on this being a whole-system approach to children and young people 's mental health , and we feel very strongly that if any of the areas get out of balance , then it will jeopardise the progress in other parts of the programme . are there any particular areas where you feel you have n't made enough progress that you 'd like to draw the committee 's attention to ? carol shillabeer : this is maybe about what the programme 's done , but really around the broader sense as well . i 'm going to be very straight and say we should have made more progress on psychological therapies . i 'm disappointed that we have n't . i 'm assured that we 've got capacity in place now and the drive in place to get the matrics cymru framework developed for children and young people . i 've had discussions with the national psychological therapies committee , who have owned this , and we 're working together more on this area . that 's not to say for one minute that health boards and local areas have n't been working on psychological therapy service provision and changing the models , but that is an area we should have made , i think , earlier progress on . there 's been a general reflection from myself and the together for children and young people programme board over the phase of the programme . i think we started very strongly ; i think we probably had a bit of a lull in the middle , if i 'm truthful about that—we had a change of personnel , and we really gathered a momentum over the last year or 18 months , and that has helped to push us from a focus on specialist camhs into that whole-school approach . but , if i could just agree with your comments about the whole system , it has to be the whole system and that 's why the real focus now on early help and enhanced support is critical . if i can just say , in case i do n't get a chance to say this later , i was delighted to see the focus on youth work yesterday , because what is clear is for that part , the early help and enhanced support , this is n't just about the nhs and it 's not just about education , it 's about every part of the system , really , which does make it more complex . but i just wanted to say that i think that youth work has perhaps not have the recognition that it 's needed and yesterday was a positive step . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . we 've got some questions now on early help and enhanced support from janet finch-saunders . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . good morning . in terms of local primary mental health support services , what is your understanding of the issues leading to some health boards not meeting the mental health ( wales ) measure 2010 targets for assessment and therapy for children and young people , and how much of this is due to an increase in demand ? carol shillabeer : yes , thanks very much . so , it 's important to say , i think , at the outset , just by way of reminder , that the target , quite rightly , changed for children and young people . the target changed some years ago for adults , so it was only right that there was an equalisation around children . so , the services were working , a couple of years ago , with significant demand and then a change in the standard . i think you 're absolutely right ; your question alludes to the fact that some health boards are struggling to maintain the full performance around seeing children , particularly within the 28 days . i would say— . and we 've had some discussion about whether the impact of the mental health measure has actually drawn perhaps some of the workforce , the staff , who would have been working at that earlier stage in local primary mental health , into a bit more of the secondary element , which is why the review being undertaken by the nhs delivery unit into primary care camhs is so critical , because , actually , if we do n't have—and i believe we do n't have—enough capacity in that part of the system , then referrals will move towards the more specialist end of this . so , i think we will have seen , by the evidence submission , that demand has increased , not just in wales but in the uk , and it has increased significantly . we are doing reasonably well at meeting that demand—so , we have more contacts , more staff , shorter access times , so that is a good news story . we 've not got it completely sustained at this stage , and therefore the focus of the delivery unit 's primary care camhs report is what more can we do in that part of the system to help to see children and young people or provide consultation and liaison to others and support people at that level of intervention . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . i know , from my own experience as a constituency am , i have families who tell me that they ca n't get into the early interventions and eventually things just become so—they end up in the more specialist ones and believe that that's— . and i do n't like to put it in resource terms , but it 's false economy in terms of the impact on the child and the family , but , obviously , in terms of cost as well . do you find that that 's a common theme across wales ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think that the thrust of that is absolutely right . so , we absolutely need to see children and families at the earliest intervention and that 's why this is a whole system , not compartmentalised . i think there have been really good attempts in a couple of areas of that greater reach out and that earlier help—hot clinics and those sorts of initiatives that help people not to get in a long queue for specialist camhs , but can be supported , often by telephone , at that earlier stage . my sense of where we go next , in terms of , you know , you talk about early help and enhanced support for all the 'missing middle ' , as you referred to it in your report , is to make sure we 've got a fully joined-up , multi-agency team approach to that . and i think that will need some resourcing to support that , yet to be fully determined . but yesterday 's announcement about youth work , the government 's commitment to primary care , camhs , et cetera—that 's all going to be very helpful to prevent those young people having to go into specialist camhs . and just a final note on that , if i may—at the beginning of the programme , we had a report from hafal called 'making sense ' and there were 10 key asks , if you like , of the system and the service from young people who had experience of the service . they said , 'please do n't medicalise it'—i 'm paraphrasing now , of course—'please do n't medicalise it ; please focus on supporting teachers and others who can support us at an earlier stage and then , when we really need help , please ensure that it is there at that more specialist level . ' that 's been a bit of a guiding principle for the programme . so , that reflects the questions that you were asking , really . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . what are the outcomes of the stakeholder workshop held last week on early help and enhanced support ? and how are the actions going to be taken forward and implemented ? and also , given that the together for children and young people programme comes to an end in october of this year , who , in your view , is best placed to forward this work stream , and what will be the biggest challenges ? it 's a bit of a long question , so , break it up however you like . carol shillabeer : that 's absolutely fine . janet finch-saunders am : and what will be the biggest challenges that they will face ? carol shillabeer : yes , i think that 's helpfully laid out in three stages . so , you 're absolutely right , there was a highly successful workshop last week really focusing on early help and enhanced support . it brought all of the agencies together , which was—and actually had a bit of a waiting list , apparently , for places . so , there was a lot of demand and a lot of interest in this . in relation to the next steps , there is a planning group reflection in early july , in terms of the outcomes of the workshop or the outputs of the workshop , and there are three commitments that have been made to this stage . one is that we develop those values-led approaches that will bring multiple agencies together to have that common purpose . the second one is to develop the ingredients for successful working in this area , and then , thirdly , to determine or propose priorities and sequencing of next steps . so , that 's the next stage of that . i 'm pretty sure we 'll come on shortly—or hopefully—to the potential of the regional partnership boards . there is some work that we are doing as a programme with the children 's commissioner in terms of working more with the regional partnership boards in taking forward this work . so , that will run alongside . but during the summer , then , we will be developing that framework approach , and we will be participating in the association of directors of social services conference in september , and then a follow-up workshop in october on this matter . on your question of 'well , what happens after the programme ? ' we are currently working on legacy arrangements for the programme . i 'm pretty secure on the specialist camhs element . that will move , most likely , to the camhs network , which is part of the nhs mental health network . i actually chair the mental health network and that 's one part of that . the whole-school approach element is already settled in government and we 've got a connection in to that . the question that 's outstanding is where the early help and enhanced support and the neurodevelopmental will go . i am currently in discussions with welsh government officials around that . i can be very clear of my own view that there needs to be a confident and clear legacy arrangement for this work . we can not afford that we 've come so far for this not now to proceed . i think there 's a huge momentum behind this . i do n't see there would be any obstacles—i hope—in getting that commitment translated into a strong approach , as we move forward . so , i 'm not in a position to say , 'and the legacy arrangements will be— ' , but i am in a position to say that i 'm having those discussions with welsh government officials . they know my view that we 've got to put something in place that is strong and secure as we move forward , and i believe that they are supportive of that . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . lynne neagle am : janet , i think those two questions have been touched on , the remaining questions . we are going to discuss in more detail the legacy arrangements , but if i could just ask on psychological therapies : you referred to the fact that you were a bit disappointed with progress in this area , and the area has n't been directly led on by the together for children and young people programme . do you think that means now that there is more of a threat to progress in this area , because , you know , we 've got different compartmentalising of actions , and this is absolutely key , is n't it , really ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think there's— . there is some refinement to be done , i think , in making sure the connections are there . so , i think , as we move to programme end , we 'll want to be absolutely assured that there are no strands left hanging , so to speak . i am confident—i mentioned the mental health network board that i chair—that we have those strands nailed down , but recognising that the early help and enhanced support and the provision of psychological support is beyond the nhs . so , this will be an area that needs to be very much seen as a key part of that . my own sense is that— . there 's been quite a lot of other developments through the life of the programme . so , in the evidence that i 've provided , you 'll see the first 1000 days , all the adverse childhood experiences work , the cymru well wales partnership , et cetera , et cetera . so , there is a bit of what i would call tidying up of the landscape to be done , and this is the ideal opportunity to do that . lynne neagle am : okay . thank you . we 've got some questions now on specialist camhs—if i can just ask about the impact of the specialist camhs framework , and how effective you feel that has been in promoting a consistent delivery of care for young people . carol shillabeer : thanks very much for that . without wanting to go back too far in history , i remember coming into this area back in 2014 as i was asked to establish a camhs network . my observation was there was n't really a strong and well-connected clinical community in this area . when we spin forward five years , i can confidently say that there is a strong and well-connected clinical community around specialist camhs . the programme has helped ; the emphasis and the focus of the programme has helped to bring people together with that more common endeavour to understand , actually , there is a good case for consistency in the main , with local variation . there has been a case for much greater learning between organisations . if i just give you an example—you 'll know that the community intensive service teams were put in place in 2015-ish . some areas have them , but a lot of areas did n't . we do have inconsistency in that , but the consistent part is there is a service now right the way across wales for more intensive support to children and young people and their families in their own homes , which helps to prevent admissions and then , where there are admissions , helps to support people to be at home . they 're all called slightly different things . so , i might have referred in my papers to citt , catt , cot and cite . so , they 've all got slightly different names and they 've got slightly different opening hours . the key thrust of this is that there is a backbone , if you like , of a consistent approach with that local variation . we have to check . so , things like frameworks for improvement—there is a coming together of the clinicians and the professionals to agree what that framework for improvement is . that then gets implemented , with some local variation . so , i think the process of moving in that way has been extremely helpful . there will be some variation . we want some variation , to some extent , as places try new things and evaluate new things . so , if i just refer to the previous question that i had , and i talked about hot clinics and different ways of reaching out ; that 's been tried in one area , been evaluated—let 's see the spread of that . so , you 'll know my view on internet counselling , for example ; i feel that is quite a strong offer for children—not necessarily in the specialist end . if that works in one area , why are n't we rolling that out to other areas ? so , i think the framework for improvement has provided a vehicle for those clinicians and professionals to come together . it 's in a stronger place—a much stronger place—than it was five years ago . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . you 've referred to there being some inconsistencies in terms of crisis care , but are you able to assure the committee that all young people are now getting at least a consistent service , especially in terms of interventions in the instances of young people self-harming . wherever you live in wales , is that help there for you now ? carol shillabeer : well , in your work to produce the 'mind over matter ' report , i clearly listened to the views from the police and the recommendations in relation to the police . we 've taken that as a further piece of work under the specialist camhs umbrella , to truly understand what the experiences of the police are and what some of the root issues may be in relation to that . for example , is it that because the cit , cat , cot , cite—the community intensive service—closes at 10 o'clock in a certain area , that actually it 's after that that the network of support is n't as strong , and , if that is the case , what are we going to do about that ? there 's certainly potential in working more regionally or even working between adults ' and children 's in terms of the crisis resolution services that work beyond those hours . so , we are taking an extra look at this , because i could not be 100 per cent confident that , throughout the 24-hour period , we 've got this fully settled . i continue to hear some stories from the police that they are picking up young people and feeling that they 've not got that solid place to go , and we 're following those through . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . we 've got some questions now from hefin david on neurodevelopmental services . hefin david am : i think , chair , i should have declared an interest here , as my daughter has been diagnosed with autism and is currently going through the process of receiving neurodevelopmental speech and language support particularly . we 're seeing an increase in neurodevelopmental referrals , and that will increase further in the future . can you give us an explanation as to why this demand is growing and how we 're going to meet capacity to deliver and for support for those children ? carol shillabeer : thank you . they 're very big questions in terms of 'why ' . i 'm not sure that anyone really knows why , if i 'm honest , although there is a lot of academic research going on . what we do know is that we are starting to see the scale of those referrals coming through . so , in the information provided , i refer to the nhs digital prevalence report in england , which indicates that about 5.5 per cent of two to four-year-olds have a mental disorder . now , that sounds a bit shocking when we say that , but that 's in the international classification scaling , and , of that , certainly , 2.5 per cent is around autism . i can just testify , in real life , that demand is absolutely growing . so , if i just take my own health board for a moment , we usually have about 75 referrals per year . last year we had 300 . so , that has felt very difficult to manage . if i can just give you a sense of what we 've done so far and then what i think is next , i want to recognise the work of dr cath norton and the steering group that 's been established on neurodevelopmental issues under the programme . they had a standing start . they 've done a lot of very , very good work . we now have seven teams in place across wales . we now have a national pathway . we now have a community-of-practice-type environment , and we 're really getting into this . good progress has been made . more people have been seen . more people have been assessed . so , we have made progress . but i 've got a long list of considerations that i think respond to your question . one is that most referrals that come through , the clinicians tell me , are seeking support to move through what they perceive to be a gateway for educational support . so , that is often the reason why people come . now , that is obviously going to be linked to the whole-school approach and how we can support that . demand is outstripping supply . so , our clinical teams are concerned about how do they keep up . so , if i just take my own example of 300 in the last year , we 're looking to try and put some additional capacity in to support seeing those families , but also then to understand what the long-term trajectory is going to be . because we 've put these teams in , because we 've got the new pathway , has that opened a gate and we 've got a lot of backlog or is that the pattern ? hefin david am : can i just ask a question there ? so , with regard to the 75 to 300 increase—in the space of a year was that ? carol shillabeer : in a year , yes . hefin david am : did you anticipate that or was that something that just came totally unexpected ? carol shillabeer : i think we anticipated a few more , and just to say that in my— hefin david am : but not on that scale . carol shillabeer : no , not on that scale . and in my own health board—i 'm just referring to my own , and i 'm happy to share the information on this—we already had a service in place . so , it was n't as if we had nothing in place previously . we had a nice-compliant service already in place , but we knew we needed to expand that , which we have done , but we did n't anticipate 300 . so , this is happening not just across wales , actually , but across the uk—so , this greater recognition , the desire for families coming forward to access that support and them seeing this as a route , which is really important . what i would also say , and this is part of the bigger picture that we need to consider going forward , is that only about 40 per cent to 50 per cent of those families that come forward have what i would call or the clinicians would call a diagnosis—so , a threshold or whatever term you want to use that takes people through to that educational support . so , we 've got a lot of people who are under that threshold , but that 's a lot of people who still need help and support . i 'm trying to very fairly and , i hope , appropriately represent the very strong views coming from the group—the workstream under the programme . we 've got to tackle all of that . it 's not going to be good enough for us just to focus our attention on those children and young people and their families who reach a threshold , because there are needs elsewhere as well , and some of that will overlap with the early help and enhanced support . some of that overlaps with learning disability services . can i just mention a few more things , as i 'm on roll on neurodevelopmental ? hefin david am : it 's up to the chair . lynne neagle am : yes , go on . carol shillabeer : is that all right ? sorry , i know it 's a very long answer . there is a concern from the neurodevelopmental group to get across that whilst there has been a lot of focus on autism—and we recognise the private member 's bill—there are other neurodevelopmental presentations and there 's a real— . having the broadest view would be advised by them , and i think they 're particularly keen to understand what a future vision and what we call , say , a 'perfect world ' would look like . that 's the piece of work that we 're wanting to do now . in terms of giving advice at the end of the programme and into legacy arrangements , about what the big , big things are , we are still needing to tackle . hefin david am : i mean , i personally took a very personal decision when it came to the member 's bill on autism you were talking about—and that was the advice i received . you need to look at the wider symptoms that are presented beyond autism and other neurological conditions . so , i 'm glad you said that , because it gives me— . because i did n't vote for that bill , and i 'm glad you said that because it gives me some personal reassurance there . but what i do have concerns about is if the increase was n't anticipated to the extent that it was and that the together for children and young people programme has a duty to review capacity , after october who 's going to make sure that that capacity 's reviewed on a strategic basis ? carol shillabeer : so , i should have probably added in that we 've got a piece of work under way at the moment—welsh government commissioned it—by a person called patrick holton , and he is specifically looking at the demands on capacity in relation to neurodevelopmental . i think getting that slightly more independent view of what we think the trends are going to be over the long term will mean we can plan for the long term . we know that money 's been put into this and it has had an important impact , but we now need to be planning for the next three , five , 10 and many years beyond that . there is the integrated autism service . i think there are some conversations , when i talk about the landscape being quite busy , about the sense of where this links as we support people through their lives with a neurodevelopmental issue . so , it 's not just about a childhood thing ; as people move through , we 've got to get much better at that long-term planning . so , that piece of work is really important . we will get the report of that over the next couple of months in order for this sort of perfect-world picture that we want to try to describe to be informed by that . it also connects to the early help and enhanced support , because recognising if we just say half of the people who come for an assessment do n't meet a threshold for a certain category , that 's a lot of people who will need help and support to manage and cope with their condition and their situation . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . if we can just move on now to in-patient care , and if i can just ask you what the programme has been doing to address some of the challenges and opportunities we face in terms of camhs in-patient care , particularly in light of the restrictions that are in place in abergele and tŷ llidiard . carol shillabeer : yes , thank you very much for that question . again , quite a lot of progress has been made in the early part of the programme around in-patients , and you are very well aware of the challenges over the last year or 18 months in relation to both units . i think , certainly , there is some recovery in the position in north wales , and the programme did a peer review visit to north wales , which i think was very helpful . in terms of where the programme has been on this issue , there is some work under way , at quite an advanced stage , around the art of the possible around enhancing the scope of the services . this was quite a tricky thing to start off when you 're in a position where , actually , there 've been some restrictions , to then ask the service to think about going even further , but we really wanted to see what the art of the possible would be if we could attract the right workforce , get the right environment , et cetera , et cetera—so , that piece of work , the review of the specification about what could be possible . clearly , we work very closely with welsh health specialised services committee as the commissioner , so we do n't commission that . we neither performance manage those environments . but , if i can just say , probably the most important part of moving forward now is the longer term work between health and social care in terms of having a much more integrated and joined up approach for children . we believe there would probably be about 100 children who have experienced care in multiple settings . we have n't got that mature approach in terms of these being joined-up teams ; we 've got social care and we 've got healthcare . there is a growing appetite to do something different . there is a meeting with the children 's commissioner on 9 july to explore that . i 've previously had conversations with the chief inspector of care inspectorate wales , for example , and we have now got , i think , a consensus growing that we need to do something very different for children and young people who are in this sort of need for the future . we also know that there 've been some high-profile legal cases as well . so , we 've got to move to that step now . it has been largely successful , the work that has taken place over recent years , but not without its key challenges . lynne neagle am : thank you . and , just briefly on the new specification that whssc are developing , that will enable admissions at weekends and out of hours . how concerned should we be about that being a challenge , particularly in abergele , where staffing has been a major issue ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think we need to be very mindful of ensuring that the right workforce are in place before that gets implemented . the peer review highlighted the challenge of the physical environment , where the unit is , the challenge across north wales of the workforce . these are issues well known by the health board , by the way , so it was n't a surprise to them . but that dialogue about how do we ensure that we 've got the right workforce , because that unit , potentially , could—you know , it 's an isolated unit , and they ’ ve been risk-managing . they 've been managing the types of young people that they can take bearing in mind the workforce that they 've got available , and that 's been entirely the right thing to do . but the downside of that is it 's not as accessible as we would want . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . hefin david has got some questions on workforce now . hefin david am : yes . with regard to the increased camhs posts that have been made available between 2016 and 2018—a 62 per cent increase in camhs posts—we know that there 's likely to be labour market demand , high labour market demand , in those instances , so are the vacancy rates higher in wales than elsewhere , given the increase in those posts to be filled ? carol shillabeer : so , you 're absolutely right . there 's been quite a lot of investment , and there have been quite a lot of new recruits coming to the service . we had in the early days a situation where we were largely robbing peter to pay paul , to be quite frank . so , as new services were being developed , people would move from one part of the system to the other . so , in the early days there was little net gain . that has improved slightly , but we 're in a national context , particularly around nursing and around some specialties in medicine , of a national shortage , so this is not a quick fix . we are starting to see a greater diversity of workforce . so , if i can mention psychology assistants , for example , my own health board is employing more psychology assistants as part of a skill mix team , rather than going to where we might have been more traditionally based . we see some of that through the nhs benchmarking , particularly with england . they have more of that . we 're perhaps a little bit— hefin david am : more of what ? carol shillabeer : they have more skill mix in their workforce . we 're catching up a bit more on that now . hefin david am : just to clarify there , what you 're referring to—there are more nursing and medical staff in the wales system and more psychological staff , experts , in the uk picture . is that— ? carol shillabeer : in the england picture . so , england had a programme called iapt , which is about psychological therapies , and had therefore looked at the skill mix . some of that was— . we 've chatted to colleagues in england , trying to learn—we 're all trying to make improvements in this area , of course ; it 's a uk and international issue—what were their experiences of this psychological therapies approach . because of their vacancies they had to skill mix , and because of the money that they had available—they did n't have as much of a cash injection as perhaps we 've been able to secure . so , they skill mixed much earlier ; we 're skill mixing now . we 're using different types of roles , for example . and if i can just make a plea , really , around recognising the input of the third sector—so , it does n't always have to be an nhs-employed person to work in service provision , direct front-line service provision , and the third sector are offering a significant contribution in a number of areas of our services . and that is one that we will need to cultivate , because , to be quite frank , our recruitment challenges wo n't be solved overnight . we 've recognised that the commissioning numbers for nursing and other professionals have gone up over recent times , but , with the training time , it 's not a quick fix . hefin david am : does the workforce profile remain different , or are they starting to— ? carol shillabeer : they 're starting to come together . there is a—graph 13 in terms of the camhs profile . each year we do the nhs benchmarking , and we can see where we are compared to others , and i would expect over the next year or two that we see a bit more narrowing . hefin david am : so , if you compare a child in wales with a child in england in the last two years who 's been through this , would they have had a different experience as a result , and different clinical advice as a result , or is there consistency despite the difference in workforce profile ? carol shillabeer : that 's quite a big question . hand on heart , could i tell you i absolutely know the detail of that ? no , i could n't . the practice in this area is guided by national institute for health and care excellence guidance , so it 's pretty much guided . we would expect all of our practitioners to be able to work to nice guidance . when you skill mix a team , you enable the right referrals to go to the right person , so you would n't necessarily have a child or young person with particularly complex needs—well , you would match them to the right practitioner for their needs . so , it does— . and we 've seen some of that ; if i just make reference to the panel approach in gwent that 's been developed , a multi-agency panel come together , a referral comes in , it 's then about matching the right service and the right person to the needs that are being presented . so , we can be much more flexible in relation to that , and we have to be careful to use the right resource for the right person , because , if we 've got a resource that is highly specialist , we want them to be dealing with those children and young people . hefin david am : and one of the things you 're able to do—because there 's a lot about the labour market you ca n't control , but one of the things you can control is workforce development and ongoing workforce development . you 've mentioned communities of practice . what other things are being done in addition , and how do the communities of practice work might be a good question , but what else is being done in order to upskill and develop and grow the existing workforce that is presented to you ? carol shillabeer : thank you for that . so , there 's a couple of things around— . i think there 's a huge focus on staff retention now , not just in wales but across the uk . so , we 've got recruitment but we 've got retention . what are the factors that affect retention ? actually , well-being , well-being at work—and you 'll know that within ' a healthier wales ' the focus on staff engagement , staff well-being , has been laid out—the ability to work well in teams and the culture of organisations and services , and , then , as you rightly say , training and development and career opportunities . so , the developments over the last few years have brought training opportunities and career development opportunities as well . i think the community of practice—it 's something that has become a bit of a standard now across these areas—actually brings people together doing collective audit , doing collective reflection on service improvement , and being very clear about learning from one another . and , if you 're a clinician , that gives you a lot of motivation to keep driving forward . so , i think we have the fundamental building blocks in place , but there is more to do around the environment in which our practitioners and our staff operate . hefin david am : what about the welsh language in the health board ? carol shillabeer : thank you very much . there are two elements , if i may , just on that . in your report of last year you highlighted the need to do further work on the use of the welsh language , and have we got enough welsh language practitioners where we need them . we are doing that piece of work . i 'm pleased to say that , over the last few years , i think all health boards have really stepped up in terms of being able to understand the levels of welsh speaking amongst employed staff and where their welsh-speaking communities are . we 're particularly looking at it in terms of in-patient camhs and community intensive services , because , particularly when people are feeling at their most vulnerable , they would choose the language they wish to choose . so , we know we need to respond to that . so , we will be in a position to , by the end of this programme , provide that position statement on what happens next . i would also say , of course , we 've got the welsh language standards that we are all working on at the moment , and we 've got a very clear programme of when we have to be compliant with those standards . so , that element is very high on the priority list . lynne neagle am : thank you . suzy davies has a question about looked-after children . suzy davies am : yes . thank you , chair . obviously , everything you 've been speaking about already , particularly about workforce development , applies to children in care as well , where there 's other work also going on in terms of support . can you give us some indication about how the programme intersects , then , with the outcomes for the children in care work programme ? carol shillabeer : thanks very much for that . so , we have one of our members of the programme board also sitting on the outcomes for children ministerial group , which is good . so , we 've got that cross-link . we also have a director of social services on our programme board and , obviously , they 're very clearly linked in to the outcomes for children . i just made reference to , under the question on specialist camhs in-patients , the need to bring those services together , and that , really , is the need for much stronger working between the outcomes for children group and the together for children and young people programme and the constituent parts . so , i 'm confident that that has been pegged now . we 've got a way forward and there is a consensus that we need to do things together on that . suzy davies am : can you just perhaps give us an example of how that then looks on the ground ? because it 's great that people are talking together , but how would that affect , i do n't know , individual members of the workforce , or , indeed , the children we 're talking about ? carol shillabeer : yes . so , if i just give an example of a unit in south wales that is a social care unit , we 've been having discussions about , 'well , actually , should n't you have a psychologist and good access to psychological therapies , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera ? ' so , we have n't yet got an agreed position on how we 're going to do this , but the position is that something needs to be done , and there is an appetite for and an understanding of the case for change , i believe . but what it will mean , i think , in practice , is that you get much more fluid roles moving across sectors , or we could be designing services that are fully integrated . now , there may be challenges in that , but , you know , let 's get them out on the table . so , in terms of this seamless health and social care system for wales , this is one of the tests of that , i would say : can we , within the next five years , 10 years , really bring that together ? that will take quite a lot of work and commitment . on the looked-after children specifically , we have picked that up , particularly following your previous report , looking specifically at the assessment of young people who are care experienced who are in the system . absolutely , part of the health assessment is emotional health and mental health . we are questioning whether that needs to be a greater part and what the level of support needs to be , particularly because of the backgrounds of children that have led them to be in those circumstances . that 's a core piece of work under the early help and enhanced support work stream , and we 'll be ensuring that that is complete by the end of the programme . suzy davies am : okay . and you 're confident that that will reach children who are being fostered and perhaps do n't have very frequent looked-after children reviews , because , from all other perspectives , things are going fairly well . carol shillabeer : yes . and , of course , there 's the edge-of-care work that the government have been supporting , and , certainly in my own area , under the regional partnership board , we have a start well programme , which is the old children and young people 's partnership programme , where there 's a significant investment in supporting children and young people , families , on the edge of care , which does pick up fostering . suzy davies am : ah , lovely . thank you . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : dawn has a question on transition . dawn bowden am : yes . thank you , chair . we 've heard , not necessarily just in the context of this report , because we 've heard similar evidence around transition arrangements in another committee report when we did the suicide prevention , and i 've in fact only recently—well , just this week , actually—met with community mental health teams in my constituency , and there is still some concern about transitional arrangements from children into adult services . now , i know we had the— . the transition guidance was published a couple of years ago now , and the programme was involved in developing that guidance . but what 's your assessment of the impact that it 's had ? because we clearly are still seeing people falling through the gaps , are n't we ? carol shillabeer : yes , thank you for that . you 're absolutely right ; we developed that guidance and we are currently in the process of the evaluation of that . and , in particular , i know that the children 's commissioner is very focused on transition , not just around children in receipt of emotional mental health support , but children in paediatric wards , and there is a working group with welsh government looking at this . the children 's commissioner has used our guidance to put that on the table to say , 'well , if this works , this needs to be considered as a model for using elsewhere ' . but the big question there is 'if ' . so , we do want to get evaluation . if i were just to give an estimate of where i think this will land , i think it will have made improvements , but there may well be some further work to do in enhancing , supporting , auditing that every child is supported in line with that guidance . so , i talked about community practice and clinical audit : is this something that we make , then , a mandatory audit , each year , that we do that double check ? because it 's one of those things where we know when a child is 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , so what 's stopping us ? if indeed the evaluation says it 's not happening everywhere , it 's not happening early enough , what is stopping us ? we really need to get underneath that . so , my sense will be it will show us , it will be better , but there 's some further work to do , and following that up in terms of audit and making sure that we 've got a systematic approach to dealing with those who have n't had the guidance fully implemented , because it can make a real difference . dawn bowden am : yes , and it seems to me—you 've just talked about having a systematic approach , and it does seem to me that it is a systematic process , is n't it ? so , it should n't be difficult . i know we 're talking about in the health service things should n't be difficult and they are , and one of the gripes—i had a meeting with the community health team—was the problems of the new it systems and so on—let 's not go there at the moment . but , really , this is just about referring children and having a smooth transition from the service being provided to them as a child and then just shifting it over to the adult services . it should n't be difficult . it 's really difficult to get my head around why that is such a problem and why that needs to be so difficult . carol shillabeer : can i add one other dimension in , which i think is going to be quite interesting ? we talk about transitions being an issue—and we know it 's not just in mental health , but it 's elsewhere—then you start to think , 'what if we could reduce transitions ? ' , so you reduce the number of transitions and you manage them better . we are doing a piece of work with government on the potential to explore what a 0-25-type service would be . we know that in different places they have approached that—in australia and places in the uk . there are probably some pros and cons , but should we be moving to a 0-25 . that is moving the transition at the age of 25 , but at least it 's not at the eighteenth birthday . what 's the argument around what adolescent , young people and young adults services are , for example ? that piece of research and understanding— dawn bowden am : you could probably have a gradual transition , then , could n't you ? carol shillabeer : quite potentially . i 've got some people who have joined my own health board who 've worked in that 0-25-type service , and we 're catching up—'tell me what was good about it ? tell me what was not so good about it ? what did the young people themselves think about that ? ' . because if we can manage down the numbers of transitions , there really should be no excuse not to get transitions right , then . dawn bowden am : okay , thank you . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : okay . we 've got some really important questions now about legacy , because throughout the session this morning you 've referred to ongoing work , really , and that is a major concern for the committee . suzy davies . suzy davies am : yes , thank you , chair , we are a little bit worried that this programme is coming to an end in a matter of months when perhaps its work 's not been completed . obviously , we 've got the welsh government 's strategy for mental health running until 2022 , which is a few years longer . can you tell me whether you think your programme needs to continue , perhaps even if it 's just for the same length of time as together for mental health , or is its work done and it needs to be picked up now by a different system ? carol shillabeer : thank you for that . can i just say , i 've given this so much thought over the time , because i think you might have asked me this question when i came previously ? there are two ways to look at this . i 'm absolutely sure that the issue of children 's emotional and mental health will be one that will be with us for a very long time . we have made a lot of progress , i think , as a society , in talking about this now . we talk about mental health so much more than we ever used to . when i was a child , we never talked about it . i talk to my own children and say , 'what 's going on in your lives at school ? ' , and they talk about this . this is not an issue , if you like , that i believe you can pick up and solve literally in five years . this is one for the long term for us . so , on the one hand , i think my view last year was that , when you have a programme of work , you should have a start , a middle and end , really—otherwise it 's not a programme of work , it 's almost forever—and there is a moment to refresh and reflect on whether that mechanism has done all it should and it should move into a different mechanism . so , my position last year was , 'this will have been running for five years—we 've done a lot of work and made progress on specialist camhs , we have made progress on the whole-school approach and there is a different mechanism for this ' et cetera . my position now is i want to just be really sure and secure that there is a strong arrangement going forward that takes this work , if this programme is going to close . suzy davies am : are you sure ? carol shillabeer : not yet . so , i think , in an earlier question i indicated dialogue going on between myself and welsh government officials . i do n't think there 's a barrier—people are n't saying , 'no , it all needs to just stop ; we 've solved the issue ' , but the exact nature of the legacy arrangements , particularly for early help and enhanced support , are not yet fully determined , or for neurodevelopmental . if it was a choice between nothing being there and continuing this programme , i would be supporting continuing the programme . i do n't think we can stop now . suzy davies am : well , i do n't think any of us would disagree with that , but i suppose there might be a level of concern that the welsh government 's preferred route from now on would be through the regional partnership boards and public services boards . you mentioned that you 've done that work in gwent , down in the south-east of your patch there . it 's quite difficult for us to try and get a picture of how that will work successfully for the whole of wales . i know you 've got your experience in gwent , but have you thought a bit more about how it might look elsewhere , if that 's the route that government decides to pursue ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think the key question in my own mind is : are the regional partnership boards yet ready and mature enough to take this forward ? i 'm the chair of the powys regional partnership board , so i should declare that . there 's a lot being asked of the regional partnership boards at the moment— suzy davies am : well , we 'll be asking them to go with the 'mind over matter ' report , to make sure that that 's delivered upon . carol shillabeer : there 's a lot , you know , ' a healthier wales'— . everyone does feel that the regional partnership boards are a route to really secure multi-agency working , so there is quite a high expectation . my understanding—and this is a rather informal understanding—is that different rpbs are in different places . so , some have retained what used to be the old children and young people partnerships , and perhaps where they have been retained , they may be in a more progressed position . some are looking to have to re-establish those . so , my sense of this is that , i think , possibly the rpbs are n't yet in that position to be ready . our piece of work on early help and enhanced support , in terms of your earlier question about what 's the commitment—that feels that that may well be another year or 18 months of development work , alongside the rpb development work , to get that ready , before we can then more confidently say where we can hand over . suzy davies am : you may not feel able to say it , then , but would be wrong in saying that , actually , it would be quite a good idea to extend the current programme , just to make sure that anyone else who might be able to run on with component parts of it is in the position to do that to our satisfaction ? carol shillabeer : i 'm happy to respond to it . my sense is that , whether it 's the programme or whether it 's something else , something needs to be there . the next stage is really multi-agency , so it may well be that the programme currently has been nhs-led—maybe it needs to be led elsewhere , maybe not . i think there 's a view that this needs to continue . i 'm less wedded to it having to be the together for children and young people programme . it may be seen as a convenient mechanism—it 's already established , we 've got a programme team et cetera , so it may be seen as a ready sort of solution . i 'm not wedded to that . what i feel strongly about is that we 've got to have the right mechanism to take it forward . suzy davies am : can i just push you on one thing there ? you mentioned , perhaps , the nhs could lead on the work , for example . is there a risk of fragmentation if we start looking— ? i 'm just thinking—i mean , we 've got the elements here : we 've got the nhs , there 's the whole-school approach , early help and enhanced support and intervention , as you mentioned earlier . if that goes to one of the players in that multi-agency approach , is there a risk that they might become too dominant , inadvertently— ? carol shillabeer : if i can just clarify—apologies if i was n't clear . i said the current programme has been nhs-led , and that might be a reason to change . suzy davies am : to mix it up a bit . oh , right , okay . anything else you want me to pursue on that— ? lynne neagle am : can i just clarify for the record , carol—because we put this to the minister last week—are you looking at asking the regional partnership boards to take this work over from october 2019 ? are you saying clearly to the committee that you do not feel that all regional partnership boards are ready for that challenge at this point ? carol shillabeer : i 'm saying that on a more , if you like it , uniformed and informal basis , we 're doing some work with the children 's commissioner now in terms of— . i know the children 's commissioner 's very interested in how rpbs are managing , developing and dealing with the issues of children and young people 's concerns . we 're working with her to understand and to mirror alongside her the understanding of the rpbs . what i would say is that there has been some preparatory work by government around supporting rpbs . so , for example , in the integrated care fund guidance last year , there was a specific reference to child and adolescent emotional mental health , which i welcomed . i 've also welcomed , literally last week , a letter to all rpb chairs giving an allocation of £200,000 per rpb to support this further work in terms of child and adolescent emotional and mental health and the early help and support element . so , all of these things are in the right direction . my sense , and i need to stress it 's a sense because we have n't done that piece of work , is different rpbs are in different places . so , how confident can we be at the october date that we could hand over ? my sense is , just to safeguard , having a mechanism in place for the next 12 to 18 months to guide this through might be advisable , and that 's what i 'm talking to officials about . lynne neagle am : and that would either be an extension of the together for children and young people programme or something else . okay , thank you . suzy davies am : thank you . because i think there is a question , is n't there , about whether the rpbs will make this enough of a priority ? i 'm a bit nervous that it might get lost in that huge amount of work you said they might have . just a final question from me : how are you establishing what the young people themselves think about the end of the programme ? are they bothered about the structure of this at all or are they just concerned that they 're getting help ? how 's the stakeholder group feeding into this ? carol shillabeer : i 've not been blown over in the rush of people saying , 'do n't go anywhere . ' [ laughter . ] it 's a really important matter for young people . i know that later on you 're meeting with the youth parliament , you 're having a joint session , which is fantastic . we 've had contact with the youth parliament because we know it 's one of their top three issues . so , it runs in the vein of that this is going to be a long-term matter for young people , i think . whether they have a specific view on the programme , i do n't know . i 've not heard that . but i 'm pretty sure they will be vocal in saying , 'we have to have these developments continue . ' it is a major issue , we 're not there yet—maybe some progress has been made but there 's still a lot to do—and i think we 'll need to be able to respond to that . suzy davies am : anything particularly you want in addition to that ? lynne neagle am : no , i think that 's fine . and if i can just say that it was really great last week at the early help and enhanced day to see young people so central to the day all the way through . it was very , very important and very welcome . suzy davies am : carol , thank you for that . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : okay . we have come to the end of our time . we had a lot of things that we wanted to cover with you . we might need to drop you a line about a couple of things that we have n't covered , but can i thank you for your attendance this morning ? as usual , you 'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting , but thank you very much for your time . carol shillabeer : thank you , all ."}

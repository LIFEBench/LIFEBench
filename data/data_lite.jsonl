国务院新闻办新闻局副局长、新闻发言人寿小丽:女士们、先生们,大家下午好。欢迎大家出席国务院政策例行吹风会。近日,国务院常务会议对今冬明春电力和煤炭等能源供应保障工作作了进一步部署。为了帮助大家更好了解相关情况,今天我们邀请到国家发展改革委党组成员、秘书长赵辰昕先生,国家能源局副局长余兵先生,国家发展改革委价格司司长万劲松先生,国务院国资委财管运行局负责人刘绍娓女士,国家矿山安监局安全基础司司长孙庆国先生,国家电网有限公司副总工程师兼市场营销部主任李明先生,请他们为大家介绍相关情况,并回答大家感兴趣的问题。下面,我们首先有请赵辰昕先生作介绍。国家发展改革委党组成员、秘书长赵辰昕:各位记者朋友,大家下午好。非常高兴参加今天的政策例行吹风会,与相关部门的同志一起给大家介绍一下近期能源保供工作的相关情况。党中央、国务院高度重视能源供应保障工作。北方地区供暖季很快就要到了,9月底10月初这段时间,习近平总书记就能源供应保障、能源安全、能源产供储销体系建设等相关工作作出重要批示指示。10月8日,李克强总理主持召开国务院常务会议,对做好今冬明春电力和煤炭等能源供应作出了进一步部署,强调要保障群众基本生活和经济平稳运行。韩正副总理也多次召开会议进行专门研究,对相关工作提出明确要求。按照党中央、国务院部署,一段时间以来,国家发展改革委会同相关方面,密切配合、迅速行动,采取了一系列有力有效措施。我把这些措施简单跟大家报告一下。第一,完善和强化跨部门协调机制。按照国务院常务会议要求,结合形势和工作需要,我们进一步完善了煤电油气运保障工作部际协调机制,形成最大合力,统筹协调和督促指导全国煤电油气运保障工作,各部门一起快速梳理当前存在的问题,有针对性并及时解决这些问题。第二,全力推动煤炭增产增供。国庆节期间,煤矿在确保安全的前提下,一直在保持正常生产,相关部门共同推动具备增产潜力的煤矿尽快释放产能。我们加快已核准且基本建成的露天煤矿投产达产,促进停产整改的煤矿依法依规整改、尽早恢复生产。我们优先保障煤炭运输,确保生产的煤炭能够及时运到需要的地方。此外,我们协调增加发电供热企业煤炭中长期合同。第三,合理疏导燃煤发电成本。督促各地切实组织好电力市场化交易,要求不得对市场价格在合理范围内的正常浮动进行不当干预。大家知道,2019年,国家发展改革委出台了深化燃煤发电上网电价形成机制改革的相关政策文件,按照文件要求,市场化交易电量的价格可以在基准电价的基础上向上浮动10%、向下浮动不超过15%。但是,过去确实有一些地方存在一些不合理的限制,它允许下浮,但不希望上浮。现在要坚决停止这种不合理干预。这一段时间,我们一直在继续研究深化改革完善煤电价格市场化形成机制。经过研究,昨天已经印发了相关文件,正在有序推动燃煤发电电量全部进入电力市场。在保持居民、农业、公益性事业用电价格基本稳定的情况下,扩大市场交易电价上下浮动范围,并且做好分类调节。第四,推动煤电机组应发尽发。我们协调电网企业和发电企业,加强电煤保障,快速抢修机组故障,全面启动临时停运发电机组,提高供应保障能力。截至10月9日,东北、华北地区8、9月份曾经临时停运的煤电机组,这些容量已经分别下降了1347万千瓦和1220万千瓦。换句话说,就是东北和华北分别有1347万千瓦机组和1220万千瓦机组已经启动起来,这就增加了负荷保障能力。第五,坚决遏制“两高”项目盲目不合理用能。我们指导有关地区统筹考虑能源保供,统筹考虑产业链、供应链安全等相关因素,有序实施“两高”项目限电,坚决遏制“两高”项目盲目发展。遏制“两高”项目盲目发展,是实现高质量发展的应有之义。限制盲目发展“两高”项目的不合理用电,我们的态度是明确的,也是坚决的。下一步,我们请各地要及时公布不符合要求的“两高”项目名单,对这些项目要坚决限制其违规用能和无序用能。第六,指导地方提升有序用电管理水平。及时调整完善有序用电方案,切实做到合同约定、用户知情,确保方案可执行、可操作,并且能够科学实施。通过以上这六项相关工作,我们采取了一系列措施。应该说,目前已经取得了阶段性成效。国家发展改革委将继续会同有关方面,认真贯彻落实党中央、国务院决策部署,坚持民生优先、坚持系统观念、坚持问题导向、坚持底线思维,充分发挥好煤电油气运保障工作部际协调机制作用,统筹发展和安全、节能与保供、近期与中长期,有序有效开展调控工作,确保今冬明春能源安全稳定供应,确保人民群众温暖过冬,确保经济社会平稳运行。借这个机会,我简单把下一步的重点工作向大家报告一下。第一,切实保障人民群众温暖过冬。我们正在督促有关方面,切实做到发电供热用煤和民生用气中长期合同全覆盖。这里很重要的是,压实地方和企业的属地责任和主体责任,增强主动性和能动性。因为这项工作涉及千千万万人民群众的切身利益,责任非常重大。我们一直要求参与相关工作的同志一定要牢记“人民至上”“发展为了人民”,要用实际行动和工作成效切实保障好冬季取暖用能。我们也在指导各地不断优化、完善有序用能方案,把保民生放在第一位。第二,进一步推动加快释放煤炭先进产能。这个刚才已经讲了,我们已做了相关工作,并且这些工作措施还在不断深化。第三,抓紧落实深化燃煤发电上网电价市场化改革的相关措施。我们近期刚刚印发了新的进一步深化改革文件,并且正在有序推动燃煤发电电量全部进入电力市场。在保持居民、农业、公益性事业用电价格稳定的前提下,将市场交易电价上下浮动的范围分别由不超过10%和15%,调整为上下浮动原则上均不超过20%,并且做好分类调节。对高耗能行业可以由市场交易形成价格,不受上浮20%的限制。而且,在这个政策之下,我们鼓励地方对小微企业和个体工商户用电实行阶段性优惠政策。第四,认真落实缓解煤电企业经营困难的财税金融措施。按照国务院要求,有关部门正在细化完善相关支持措施,也在与金融机构和相关企业进行具体的沟通指导,切实保障煤电企业购煤等合理融资需求。第五,坚决遏制“两高”项目盲目发展。我们在督促地方全面排查“两高”项目情况,对“两高”项目实行清单管理,进行分类处置、动态监控,不符合要求的“两高”项目我们要对其坚决整改,我们要在主要耗煤行业大力推进煤炭节约利用。第六,坚持“全国一盘棋”。我们在工作中,纠正有的地方“一刀切”停产限产或者“运动式”减碳,反对不作为、乱作为,严禁部分地区形成“资源先供本地”这样的小循环和保护主义倾向,严禁地方擅自关停煤矿。第七,坚决压实各方保供责任。我们各个部门在督促地方政府落实能源保供的属地责任,督促主要产煤省和重点煤炭企业按照国家要求,落实增产增供任务,督促中央电力企业全力保障发电机组应发尽发,确保民生用电稳定和电网安全。第八,中长期工作一直要持续推进。我们持之以恒、稳步推进能源产供储销体系建设,统筹好能源保供和低碳转型关系,坚持“先立后破”。我们正在大力推进以沙漠戈壁荒漠为重点的大型风电、光伏基地建设,加快应急备用和调峰电源建设,同时积极推进煤炭、天然气、原油储备以及储能能力建设。我先介绍这些,我和几位同事愿意一起回答大家的提问。谢谢。寿小丽:谢谢赵辰昕秘书长。下面进入提问环节,提问前请大家通报一下各自所在的新闻机构。香港中评社记者:据了解,近期,山西、内蒙古已经对辖区内部煤矿的产量进行了核增,并允许部分已完成全年产量的煤矿在四季度继续生产。请问,是否将会有更多地区采取类似的措施增加煤炭供应?接下来国家发展改革委还将计划采取哪些举措来增产增供?今年冬季采暖用煤能否得到保障?谢谢。赵辰昕:谢谢您的提问。记者朋友们都很敏锐,相信大家都注意到了,今年以来,随着疫情之后经济逐步恢复,全球能源需求都在大幅增加。我们看到各国公布的一些公开数据,今年上半年,美国煤炭消费量同比增长近30%,国际市场上的情况,媒体也都在持续关注,现在各个能源品种的价格都在大幅上涨。比如9月底英国的电价比去年同期,不仅翻倍,并且还要高,天然气价格同比上涨了2.5倍以上。国际lng价格创出历史高位。10月11日,东北亚现货lng价格是35.2美元/百万英热单位,同比上涨5.4倍。10月8日,澳大利亚纽卡斯尔港动力煤价格244美元/吨,同比上涨3.2倍。我们为什么要给大家介绍一下最近看到的这些能源价格的情况呢?这是一种大的全球能源供应形势,这也是我们开展能源保供工作所必须面对的复杂形势。大家知道,我国能源资源禀赋的情况,煤炭在保障国家能源安全中一直在发挥重要作用。确实像刚才这位记者所讲的,根据近期供需形势,山西、内蒙古、陕西等相关地区在保障安全生产的前提下,推动具备增产潜力的煤矿尽快释放先进产能,加快已核准且基本建成的露天煤矿投产达产,促进停产整改的煤矿依法依规整改、尽早恢复生产。前几年,我也一直在参与供给侧结构性改革、去产能等相关工作。我认为,这是在供给侧结构性改革成果得到巩固的情况之下,充分释放现有合法合规煤矿的先进产能,以保障国家能源安全供应的应有之策。中国是世界经济发展的重要引擎,近年来对世界经济增长的贡献率一直保持在30%左右。去年以来,我们成功应对新冠肺炎疫情的冲击,在全球主要经济体中率先复苏,这对于推动全球经济恢复、稳定全球供应链发挥了重要作用。保障好中国的能源供应,确保中国经济持续平稳健康发展,实际上也是在为世界经济、全球经济的稳定恢复提供动力之源。按照党中央、国务院决策部署,国家发展改革委与有关部门共同运用市场化、法治化手段,有力有序做好相关工作,保证煤炭稳定供应,相关省份也在积极采取措施,并且已经取得了阶段性成效。所以说今冬明春煤炭供应是有保障的,我们也有能力保障好能源供应。去年,习近平总书记宣布中国将提高国家自主贡献力度,采取更加有力的政策和措施,力争2030年前二氧化碳排放达到峰值,努力争取2060年前实现碳中和。今年4月22日,习近平总书记出席领导人气候峰会并发表重要讲话,强调中国将严控煤电项目,“十四五”时期严控煤炭消费增长,“十五五”时期逐步减少。实现这些目标,中国要付出极其艰巨的努力,但中国言出必行,将坚定不移加以落实。我们将在保障国内能源供应的同时,确保如期实现碳达峰、碳中和的目标。我们会同相关部门已经在政策上做了大量的顶层设计工作,不断构建碳达峰、碳中和“1+n”政策体系,推出扎扎实实的具体举措。今天的主题,主要是能源保供。所以这方面我就不占用更多的时间,只是简单说几个例子。比如,加快煤电机组改造升级等实实在在的举措。我国现在的煤电机组整体水平在全世界是最先进的,我国度电的煤耗比美国低30克以上。即使在这种情况下,我们仍将进行大规模升级改造,使其更节能、更低碳。昨天,习近平主席在《生物多样性公约》第十五次缔约方大会领导人峰会上再次强调,中国将大力发展可再生能源,在沙漠、戈壁、荒漠地区加快规划建设大型风电光伏基地项目。第一期装机容量约1亿千瓦的项目,近期正在组织开工。我举这几个例子是想说明,我们国家正在采取具体行动。最后我想再强调一下,今冬明春能源供应是能够得到保障的,并且我们也能够统筹兼顾实现既定目标,谢谢。中央广播电视总台央视记者:近一段时间,很多地方都采取了限电措施,给工业生产和居民生活造成了一定的影响。请问,限电的原因是什么?今冬明春电力供应形势怎么样?下一步还将采取哪些措施来保障电力供应?赵辰昕:感谢您的提问。这一段时间很多人都在问这个问题,我们也看到很多专家,包括行业内外的人士,都在做各自的分析研究,并且不少人士也发表了相关看法,正所谓众说纷纭。这到底是什么原因呢?10月8日,李克强总理主持召开国务院常务会议,对有关情况作出了全面分析。会议指出,今年以来国际市场能源价格大幅上涨,国内电力、煤炭供需持续偏紧,多种因素导致近期一些地方出现拉闸限电,给正常经济运行和居民生活带来影响。这个分析判断是非常客观和精准的。国务院常务会议对进一步做好今冬明春电力和煤炭等供应工作也作出了部署。现在大家关心的是,在今冬明春电力、煤炭供求压力依旧比较大的情况下,能源保障供应能不能做到、怎么做到。首先,我想再重复一遍刚才我回答第一个问题时强调过的,我们能够做到保障能源安全稳定供应。到底如何做到呢?我想,那就是相关部门一道,坚定不移落实好党中央、国务院决策部署,把工作落实落细落到位。国家发展改革委将会同煤电油气运保障工作部际协调机制各成员单位,加强运行协调调度,确保电力、煤炭稳定可靠供应。大家更多是关心电力方面的情况,关于保障电力的可靠供应,我想再说几点。第一,保障发电供热用煤。刚才我已经介绍了推进增产增供情况,在此基础上,我们还会继续组织煤炭企业与煤电企业再签订一批中长期合同,实现发电用煤中长期合同全覆盖。会同有关部门和企业,在煤源落实、铁路运力等方面全力加强协调,推动煤炭、电力企业双方签订的中长期合同能够严格执行。指导地方和企业提前制定冬季电力用煤保供方案,做好入冬前的煤炭储备。很多地方,特别有供热需要的地方都在做这些相关工作,而且也有非常重要的进展,确保发电用煤充足供应。第二,保障发电机组有效出力。我们在压实地方的属地责任和电力企业的保供主体责任,加强资源统筹调度,克服困难,全力保障火电机组高比例开机、高负荷出力。督促发电企业做好电煤保障,加强机组运行维护、提升安全生产能力。指导电网企业优化电力运行方式,促进水电、核电、风电、光伏发电等清洁能源发电多发满发。第三,强化大电网余缺互济。充分发挥我国大电网的大范围资源配置优势,加强跨省跨区电力运行统筹协调,在局部地区电力供应偏紧的时候,依靠大电网有效给予支持。健全完善跨省跨区电力市场化交易机制,用足用好刚刚出台的燃煤发电上网电价市场化改革政策,提升市场主体跨省区电力支援积极性。第四,坚决遏制“两高”项目盲目发展。精准管控“两高”项目用能需求,着力严控化石能源消费增长。督促地方全面排查“两高”项目情况,坚决遏制“两高”项目发展。在改革完善煤电价格市场化形成机制中做好分类调节,对高耗能行业由市场交易形成价格,不受上浮的20%限制。第五,坚决保住民生用能。民生用能占整个供应的比重并不高,我们统计,居民用电量占全部用电量的15%左右,民生用气占全部用气的比例不到50%。这些民生用电和用气全额保障没有问题。我们将指导地方和企业坚持民生优先,必要时“压非保民”,科学制定有序用能方案,确保限电不限居民,限气也不限居民。我就回答这些。谢谢。封面新闻记者:我们注意到,目前部分的煤矿紧急扩能。请问这对当下煤炭供应的情况有哪些缓解作用?监管部门如何防止不达标的煤矿以保供为由,扩能增产?谢谢。国家矿山安监局安全基础司司长孙庆国:您问的这个问题很好,这也是我们应急管理部、矿山安监局高度关注的问题,同时感谢您对矿山安全工作的关注,感谢您对矿工生命安全的关心。应急管理部、矿山安监局高度重视煤炭安全保供工作,坚决贯彻落实党中央、国务院关于今冬明春电力能源保供工作的决策部署,多次研究落实措施,充分发挥具备增产潜力的煤矿发挥作用,做到既为保供工作保驾护航,又同时坚守安全底线。从目前工作情况来看,我们已经审核976处煤矿,本着特殊时期特事特办、适当放开、严守底线的原则,逐矿进行安全条件审核。其中有153处煤矿符合安全保供条件,大约增加产能2.2亿吨/年,预计四季度可增加煤炭产量5500万吨,平均日增产达到60万吨,对缓解供需紧张、平抑煤炭价格具有积极作用。但是,我们同时也要看到,紧急扩能必须是有序、有度扩能。我们要坚持“全国一盘棋”的思想,明确扩能增产的审查原则,坚决不允许自行其是、一哄而上,更不允许以保供的名义放松安全标准、突破安全底线,把安全的矿井扩成不安全的矿井,把低风险的矿井扩成高风险的矿井,从而给矿工生命安全带来风险。对于您提的这个问题,我们主要从以下四个方面进行工作,以防止紧急情况下不达标煤矿的扩能。第一,严把审核关口。严防灾害严重矿井、存在重大隐患的矿井、安全保障能力不足的矿井等这些不达标的矿井,以保供的名义“搭便车”,盲目扩能增产。同时,对于纳入保供名单的煤矿,我们要求生产能力主管部门逐矿进行现场核实。对于采掘接续紧张,安全管理团队达不到要求,靠搞“人海战术”增加头面、增加职工劳动强度来扩能增产的一律不允许通过。第二,加强服务和指导。组织专家对重点保供地区的煤矿开展“一对一”的安全技术服务,比如协调科研机构、有关企业的专家对西北地区开展防治水专家会诊,在西北地区重点煤矿当中开展了一系列卓有成效的工作,及时消除隐患、确保安全生产。第三,强化监管监察。重点监察这些保供煤矿是不是按照核定后的能力组织生产。第四,压实保供煤矿安全生产主体责任。督促保供煤矿落实包保责任,加强监督检查,及时解决安全生产当中存在的问题,确保保供煤矿安全保供、稳定保供。谢谢。中国新闻社记者:请问,面对今冬明春较大的电力热力保供压力,国家能源局将采取哪些措施保障好人民群众的温暖过冬?谢谢。国家能源局副局长余兵:谢谢你的提问。今冬明春确实面临比较大的电力、热力保供压力。我们坚决贯彻党中央、国务院的决策部署,经过前一阶段的工作,在各方努力下,自10月份以来,全国电力供需紧张形势已经有所缓解。10月11日,全国日发电量207亿千瓦时,当月累计发电量2285亿千瓦时,同比增长10.8%。截至目前,年累计发电量已经达到62749亿千瓦时,同比增长13.1%。应该说,这个增长量还是比较大的。全国统调电煤库存8199万吨,目前可用天数是15天。10月11日全国合计有序用电电力4842万千瓦,有序用电量已经比9月份最高峰有所下降。为了确保当前电力稳定供应,国家能源局采取了三个方面的措施。一是开展电力供应保障形势研判和问题会商。近期,国家能源局多次召开专题会议,会商研判电力保供形势,加强电力运行监测,并且赴中国气象局、国家电网公司、国家能源集团等有关单位和企业开展调研、会商,科学研判今冬明春气象情况和电力煤炭保供情况,做好预案。会同有关方面全力以赴做好煤炭增产增供,优先保障发电供暖用煤。二是继续推动各类电源项目建设和投产工作。推动具备条件的支撑性电源投产,缓解电力供应紧张。结合“十四五”可再生能源发展规划,会同有关方面加快推进大型风电、光伏基地建设,推动具备条件的应急储备电源和热电尽快投产。1月—9月,风电投产超过1400万千瓦,光伏投产超过2200万千瓦,能够适当缓解电力供应紧张的局面。三是缓解煤电企业经营压力。配合国家发展改革委做好燃煤发电上网电价市场化改革相关工作,从价格机制等方面推进电力安全稳定供应,缓解煤电企业压力。下一步,国家能源局还将采取四个方面的措施确保今冬明春电力和热力供应。一是加强电力热力供应形势监测预警。会同有关部门开展全国迎峰度冬气候趋势预测,研判对能源保供可能产生的影响,重点关注民生用电用热的保障,守住民生的底线。督促电力行业做好应对极端天气和自然灾害、突发事件的应急准备工作。二是全力做好迎峰度冬电力热力保供工作。督促各地在建的具备条件的支撑性电源及时投产发挥作用,推动条件成熟的大型风电、光伏基地开工建设。指导有关企业加强设备维护、检修管理,保障机组稳定出力。督导重点城市确定电力保供应急方案,东北等地区要坚持“以热定电、以热为先”的原则,做好今冬明春电力热力的保障工作。三是强化北方地区清洁取暖工作。我们印发了《关于做好2021年北方地区清洁取暖工作的通知》,多措并举保障清洁取暖用能,科学制定极端天气应急预案。四是继续加强能源监管工作。督促各地将国家重大能源政策和各项调控保供措施落实到位,确保今冬明春能源稳定供应,确保居民用能安全。我们也有“12398”能源监管热线,及时将群众反映的问题交相关单位协调解决,切实回应好人民群众用能诉求。谢谢。中国县域经济报记者:提一个关于各界关注的电价问题。请问,是否有计划上调居民和工业电价来弥补电厂由于煤炭价格上涨造成的损失?谢谢。国家发展改革委价格司司长万劲松:刚才赵辰昕秘书长在介绍当中已经回答了这个问题,我愿意借这个机会再跟大家对电价改革有关情况作一下介绍。10月8日,国务院常务会议对做好今冬明春煤炭和电力供应保障工作作出了一系列部署。国家发展改革委贯彻落实国务院常务会议精神,迅速出台了《关于进一步深化燃煤发电上网电价市场化改革的通知》,昨天全文已正式对外发布。我先给大家介绍一下背景情况。近年来,我们按照党中央、国务院决策部署,一直持续推动电价市场化改革。目前已经有70%的燃煤发电电量、40%以上的工商业用户进入电力市场,价格由市场形成。燃煤发电上网电价机制,刚才赵秘书长已经介绍了,原来实行标杆电价,2019年改成“基准价+上下浮动”的市场化电价形成机制,当时规定的幅度是上浮不超过10%、下浮原则上不超过15%,燃煤发电上网电价大部分已经市场化了。这次改革的主要内容有四个方面,可以简要概括为“两个有序放开、一个扩大、一个稳定”。“两个有序放开”。第一个是有序放开全部燃煤发电电量的上网电价。刚才我们已经说了,目前已经有70%以上的燃煤发电电价是由市场形成,剩余30%的燃煤发电电量也要全部进入市场,在“基准价+上下浮动”范围内,通过市场交易来形成上网电价。第二个是有序放开工商业用户用电价格。目前已有40%以上的工商业用户通过市场来购电,在此基础上有序推动其他工商业用户进入市场,按照市场价格购电,同步取消工商业目录销售电价。对暂时还没有从市场购电的用户,建立起电网企业代理购电机制。所谓代理购电,就是电网企业向这些工商业用户供电,不再按照目录销售电价(因为目录销售电价已经取消了),而是按照市场价格,根据购进价格的变化,销售价格也会相应调整。“一个扩大”,就是扩大市场交易电价的上下浮动范围。前面也提到了,现行的规定是上浮不超过10%,下浮原则上不超过15%,这次统一扩大为上下浮动原则上均不超过20%,其中特别强调对高耗能企业市场交易电价不受上浮20%的限制。“一个稳定”,这也是这次改革一个特别重要的内容,就是我们保持居民、农业、公益性事业用电价格稳定。居民、农业、公益性事业用电仍然是由电网企业保障供应,还是执行目前价格水平不变。这次改革标志着在“放开两头”,即放开上网侧和销售侧电价方面,迈出了重要一步,核心就是建立起了“能跌能涨”的市场化电价形成机制。从短期来看,这次改革有利于进一步理顺“煤电”关系,保障电力安全稳定供应。从长期来说,可以用“四个推动”来概括它的意义。一是加快推动电力市场建设发展,这个电力市场包括电力中长期交易、现货市场和辅助服务市场;二是推动电力行业高质量发展;三是推动新型电力系统构建;四是推动能源绿色低碳转型。谢谢。彭博社记者:中国最近推出了政策推动支持煤炭生产。这些政策会永久存在吗?会不会影响国家双碳目标的实现?谢谢。赵辰昕:感谢彭博社记者的提问。其实,我在回答刚才其他问题的时候已经谈到了。根据中国资源禀赋情况,煤炭在保障国家能源安全中一直发挥着重要作用。近期,我们释放煤炭先进产能,释放的都是合法合规煤矿,这种释放是按照市场化、法治化办法来推进的。相关政策一直坚持市场在资源配置中发挥决定性作用,还有一点,就是更好发挥政府的作用,这两条是我们一直在坚持的。至于您提到的释放煤炭先进产能是不是会影响到实现碳达峰、碳中和目标,其实我刚才已经讲到了,我们有能力保障我国能源的安全稳定供应。我们在做工作的时候,一直坚持系统思维、统筹兼顾。中国人言出必行,我们宣布的目标一定会坚定不移完成。谢谢。第一财经记者:中央企业提供了全国近1/4的煤炭产量,为全国的电煤供应发挥了重要作用。请问国资委,作为能源的国家队,国资央企在助力能源保供稳价方面将有哪些新的举措?谢谢。国务院国资委财管运行局负责人刘绍娓:首先,谢谢您的提问。非常感谢各位媒体朋友长期以来对国资央企改革发展事业的关心和支持。就如您刚才所说的,中央企业是我国能源供应的主力军,承担了90%以上的油气供应,承担了60%以上的电力供应,承担了25%以上的煤炭供应。近年来,在新冠肺炎疫情防控以及抗震抗洪救灾这样一些紧要关头,中央企业都是冲在了一线,敢于碰硬、敢打硬仗,全力保障电力、油气、通信、医疗、粮食物资等稳定供应,发挥了关键时期顶得上、顶得住的“顶梁柱”作用。尤其是自今年以来,面对煤炭电力供应紧张的局面,中央企业讲政治、顾大局,讲使命、担责任,积极增产扩销稳供。1月—9月,央企的煤机发电量同比增长14.4%,高于全社会用电量的增幅1.5个百分点。煤炭产量同比增长5.9%,高于全国煤炭产业增幅1.5个百分点,这充分体现了央企作为“大国重器”的责任担当。9月底,个别地区出现拉闸限电现象,国资委和中央企业坚决贯彻党中央、国务院决策部署,积极作为、勇担重任,第一时间采取了有力有效的应急举措。带头增加煤炭供应,全力保障供电安全,为缓解当前缺电限电局面作出积极努力和贡献。从国资委层面来看,主要做到了“四个迅速”。一是迅速开展全线动员。9月27日下午国务院召开专题会议,国资委主要负责同志当晚就紧急召集14家央企能源企业主要负责人召开专题会议,部署央企保供工作。9月30日下午,国资委有关负责同志再次组织在京能源央企召开专题会,进行再部署、再督促,进一步明确工作要求。二是迅速组建火线专班。国资委第一时间成立了国资委领导担任组长的保供工作专班,建立了工作日报、督促落实、考核约束和政策协调四个工作机制,全力推动保供工作。三是迅速深入一线督导。10月1日,国资委主要负责同志带队到7家在京电力煤炭央企现场调研督导,并和南方电网视频连线督导。10月11日,国资委有关负责同志带队到内蒙古宝日希勒等煤矿实地督导调研,督促企业加快释放先进产能。四是迅速实施红线考核。国资委紧急研究确定了今冬明春能源供应保障专项奖惩办法,把保供工作作为相关央企主要考核指标,对作出特殊贡献的企业予以考核奖励,对工作不力、造成保供事故的实行一票否决、并严肃追责。从中央企业层面,把保障东北地区能源电力供应安全作为当前保供的重中之重,做到了“四个全力以赴”。一是全力以赴稳量稳价,积极发挥中央煤炭企业“风向标”的作用。在确保安全生产的前提下,多措并举释放先进产能,坚决做到“能采尽采、能产尽产”。自10月1日以来,央企东北煤矿日均产煤比节前前四天平均产量增长23%。同时,带头多签中长期合同,努力稳定市场价格,国家能源集团和中煤集团两家中央煤炭企业中长协合同兑现率超过90%,向下游企业让利超过500亿。二是全力以赴供电供暖,积极发挥中央发电企业“压舱石”作用。中国华能、中国大唐、中国华电、国家电投等企业克服“买不到煤、买不起煤”的困难,在越发越亏的情况下,仍然不惜成本、不计代价,抢煤补库,并抓紧抢修机组故障,全力启动临停机组,坚决做到“能开尽开、能发尽发”。自9月27日以来,新开临停机组2239万千瓦,净增1037.5万千瓦。截至10月11日,中央企业东北电厂存煤量比9月27日增长28%,煤炭库存平均可用天数增长44%。三是全力以赴保民保农,积极发挥中央电网企业“主力军”的作用。国家电网和南方电网全面启动应急机制,加强运行监测和负荷预测,保障各类电源“能并尽并、能用尽用”。坚持“需求响应优先,有序用电保底”,优化控制策略、严肃调度纪律,确保民生用电、农业用电不受影响,坚决落实“限电不拉闸”。自9月27日以来,电网企业东北地区日均发受电量稳定在12亿千瓦时以上,没有再发生拉闸限电事故。四是全力以赴增产增供,积极发挥中央油气企业“稳定器”作用。中国石油、中国石化、中国海油、国家管网等企业持续加强气源供给管理,大力推进国产气增储上产,积极扩大进口天然气资源,组织“南气北上”重点保障北方地区群众取暖用气。认真落实资源气量、合同气量、储采气量、调峰气量,坚决做到“限气不关阀”。1月—9月,中央石油石化企业国内天然气产量同比增长9.3%,进口天然气气量同比增长24.7%,采暖用气保障能力显著增强。下一步,国资委和中央企业将深入贯彻习近平总书记“以人民为中心”的发展思想,始终牢记“国之大者”,从维护国家能源安全和经济安全的高度出发,坚持系统观念,坚守民生用能底线,以更高标准、更大力度、更细措施全力做好供煤、供暖、供气工作,坚决打好打赢今冬明春保供攻坚战,为确保人民群众温暖过冬,维护国民经济平稳运行积极贡献国资央企力量。海报新闻记者:近期,多个省份出现了用电紧张的情况。请问,电网企业在应对电力供需紧张方面采取了哪些措施?谢谢。国家电网有限公司副总工程师兼市场营销部主任李明:感谢你的提问。自今年年初以来,我国经济稳定恢复,支撑电力需求保持了旺盛增长。1月—9月,国家电网经营区全社会用电量达到4.8万亿千瓦时,同比增长近13%。迎峰度夏期间,最大负荷达到9.48亿千瓦,同比增长8.3%,多地省级电网最大负荷超过历史最高水平。自9月份以来,电力供需形势持续紧张,国家电网经营区有17个省份实施了有序用电,日最大规模已经超过了3900万千瓦,影响程度远超今年年初极寒天气和夏季负荷高峰时段。党中央、国务院高度重视保暖保供保民生工作。近期,政府部门多次召开会议作出部署,国家电网有限公司坚决落实,第一时间建立了保供电应急机制,成立领导小组、协调小组,建立了日报告、日协调、日会商制度,出台有力措施,全力以赴保安全、保供电、保民生。可以说,有效保障了国庆期间电力有序供应。即将进入冬季,这个期间北方地区处于用电高峰期,又是水电枯水期,水电电量大幅下降,还有热电联产机组供暖期,这是“三期相遇”。这个时期电力需求将进一步增长,我们预计最大负荷将达到10亿千瓦,超过历史同期的9.7亿千瓦电力水平。总体来看,在这个期间还是一个紧平衡状态,局部也存在硬缺口,电网的保供电压力还是较大的。国家电网作为央企,将牢牢扛起电力保供电责任,始终坚持以人民为中心的发展理念,认真践行“人民电业为人民”的企业宗旨,以更高标准、更严要求、更细举措、更实作风,全力做好今冬明春电力保供工作。具体措施如下:一是要充分发挥大电网资源优化配置优势,统筹电力电量平衡。二是加强发电机组并网管理,保障各类电源“能并尽并、能用尽用”。三是配合政府科学优化并严格执行有序用电方案,严格管控“两高”项目用电需求。四是强化优质服务,及时响应客户诉求、回应社会关切,坚决守住大电网安全和民生用电底线,与大家一道守护好万家灯火。谢谢。红星新闻记者:国家矿山安全监察局近日要求,严防停产整顿矿、长期停产矿等6类矿井铤而走险违规生产。如何在能源保供的同时,做好不盲目增产并压实安全责任?谢谢。孙庆国:国家矿山安全监察局近日发出通知要求,严防停产整顿、长期停产等6类矿井铤而走险,防止其违法生产、发生事故,给保供大局带来不利影响。从这个方面来说,我刚才也讲了,在紧急情况下,煤炭供需紧张,扩能必须是有序扩能、有度增产。要坚持“一盘棋”的思想,坚决不允许自行其是、一哄而上,也坚决不允许以保供的名义来突破安全底线,要把煤矿安全生产工作放在一个最重要的位置。为了防止盲目增产和压实责任,我们主要做了以下四个方面的工作。第一,迅速严格进行安全审查。上一位记者也提出了类似的问题,我们将对于灾害严重的矿井、对于存在重大隐患的矿井、对于瓦斯经常超限的矿井、对于下井人员超标的矿井、对于搞“人海战术”,靠增加采掘工作面来增产保供,像这样的安全保障程度比较低的煤矿,我们是坚决不允许其打着保供的名义来盲目增产的。同时,我们也要严格进行现场审查,对每一个保供的煤矿都要派出专家队伍,到煤矿现场审查各个生产系统、审查管理制度、审查管理团队、审查其是否都达到要求,防止不具备安全生产条件的煤矿盲目扩能增产。第二,加强服务指导,做到既为保供保驾护航,又守住安全底线。这个保驾护航就是对保供的煤矿加强服务和指导。比如刚才讲过了对西北地区协调科研机构、煤炭企业的专家,开展了防治水专家会诊。对灾害严重的矿井省份,我们组织30多位业内知名专家以及40多家科研机构,开展了科技进企业的活动,指导帮助各地和煤矿企业辨识、管控重大风险,排查治理重大隐患,提高煤矿灾害治理能力,这样也为能源保供提供一个安全、稳定的环境。第三,加强监督检查,确保安全生产。10月份,国家矿山安监局将对10个省(区)和新疆生产建设兵团开展矿山安全生产综合督查,同时组织两轮异地执法检查,紧盯刚才提到的停产整顿煤矿、长期停工停产煤矿、技改重组煤矿、即将关闭煤矿、大班次煤矿和保供煤矿六类煤矿开展执法检查,严厉打击违法违规行为。这6类煤矿,除了保供煤矿之外,其余的5类煤矿都是非正常生产煤矿。应该说,其安全风险很大,对职工生命安全威胁很大。增产保供煤矿由于生产组织发生变化,也带来一定的风险。这是我们关注的重点,也是严防漏管失控的重点。第四,进一步压实责任,这个责任分为两个方面。对于监管监察部门来说,就是要严格按照《关于进一步压实矿山安全监管监察责任切实消除监管盲区的通知》要求,将各类矿山都纳入监管监察范围,压实每一处矿山的安全监管责任,明确负责人员并向社会进行公布,消除监管盲区。对煤矿企业来说,就是要严格落实安全生产主体责任,落实领导干部的包保责任,同时要深入研判安全风险、制定管控措施、加强监督检查、加强现场管理,切实对发现的问题督促、研究并及时整改到位,确保煤矿安全平稳生产。这样为整个煤炭供应提供一个良好的安全生产环境,守护好安全生产的底线,守护好矿工生命安全。谢谢。寿小丽:大家对能源保供问题高度关注,还有不少记者举手。由于时间关系,我们提最后两个问题。南方都市报记者:近期,受我国经济持续恢复和国际大宗能源原材料价格上涨影响,我国煤炭消费超预期增长,供需偏紧。请问,国家能源局已经采取了哪些煤炭稳产增产措施?下一步还将采取哪些措施稳定煤炭生产?谢谢。余兵:谢谢你的提问。国家能源局认真贯彻落实党中央、国务院关于能源保供的决策部署,积极会同有关部门、重点产煤省区细化措施,全力以赴做好煤炭增产增供工作,近期主要开展了以下几个方面的工作。一是现场督导煤炭增产增供。我们到产煤地区现场了解煤矿的生产运行情况(有的下了井),督促在保障安全的前提下进一步挖掘增产潜力,优先保障发电、供暖等民生用煤。二是消除不合理的限产措施。刚才国家矿山安全监察局孙司长也说了,我们一道印发了相关通知,指导产煤地区和有关中央企业全力以赴做好煤炭生产供应,各类生产煤矿按照设计(核定)生产能力正常组织生产,实现增产增供。三是压紧压实煤炭增产增供责任。分省跟进督促,要求各产煤省区和煤炭企业提高政治站位、强化责任担当,把煤炭增产增供作为当前的重要任务盯紧抓实。四是国庆期间针对性开展督促和检查。坚持每天到岗值守,并且与产煤地区的有关部门保持联系,重点了解煤矿是否正常生产,帮助其协调解决突出问题,充分利用节假日用煤低谷,把煤电供暖企业煤炭库存提上来。五是强化煤炭产量调度。坚持全国产煤地区的煤炭产量日调度,增加重点煤炭企业产量旬调度,分析研判煤炭生产形势,及时帮助破解制约煤炭增产的瓶颈。六是研究进一步释放产能。我们和国家矿山安全监察局一道,正在梳理有增产增供潜力的煤矿名单,准备再释放一批产能。通过上述一些措施,应该说煤炭产量取得较为显著的增长。近日,煤炭日产量已经稳定在1120万吨以上,比国庆节前增加了80万吨,创造了今年2月份以来的新高。从重点的产煤地区来看,晋陕蒙日均产煤量已经超过800万吨,发挥了大省大矿作用。下一步,国家能源局将继续坚决贯彻落实好党中央、国务院关于能源保供的决策部署,统筹增产保供和安全环保,紧盯煤炭生产,积极协调增产增供过程中的突出问题,着力释放优质产能、有效产能,确保今冬明春煤炭产量在较高水平保持稳定。重点是盯好产煤大省(区)产能大矿,充分发挥其顶梁柱和主力军作用,对产能利用率高、已经达产的省区,督促其持续稳产,抓好安全生产,避免因为安全事故停产造成产量波动。对产能利用率偏低、仍有增产潜力的省(区),将及时督促指导,并帮助其解决实际困难,尽快把产量提上来,实现安全增产增供。此外,国家能源局将督促指导有关方面将国家已经出台的各项措施落实落地,推进建设煤矿尽快投产达产,加快产能核增、加快产能释放,有序有效增加煤炭供应。密切关注迎峰度冬煤炭保供形势,突出抓好东北等重点地区煤炭保供,优先保障发电供暖用煤,确保人民群众温暖过冬。谢谢。凤凰卫视记者:北方即将进入供暖季,目前天然气供应储备情况如何?近期国际天然气价格暴涨,冬季供暖用气需求是否能够保障?另外,据说西北、东北部分地区供暖计划时间比往年延后,请问这是否是由于资源供应方面的问题?谢谢。赵辰昕:谢谢凤凰卫视记者的提问。保障北方地区人民群众取暖用气需要,是冬季天然气保供的首要任务。这些年,我们一直在做天然气的冬季保供工作,积累了不少经验。今年以来,国家发展改革委会同各地区、有关部门和企业,坚持以人民为中心的发展思想,提前做了大量准备工作,持续大力推进天然气产供储销体系建设,这些工作为冬季天然气保供提供了重要基础。截至目前,我们已经落实供暖季保供资源量1744亿立方米,还在进一步组织企业挖掘增产增供潜力。从天然气储备情况看,供暖季全国可形成储气量270亿立方米以上。目前,各大地下储气库已基本完成注气,为冬季保供打下了坚实基础。针对近期国际气价大幅上涨的严峻形势,我们会加紧把相关的工作进一步落实落细,多措并举切实保障北方地区取暖用气需要,重点开展以下几项工作:第一,督促供需双方严格按照签订合同保障供用气。目前各地签订的合同量比去年实际消费量都有不小的增长,对北方地区取暖用气需要可以做到合同全覆盖。第二,督促各地和相关企业严格执行居民用气门站价格政策,保持取暖等民生用气价格基本稳定,将国际气价上涨的影响降低到可控范围。当前,国际市场lng现货到岸价格达到9元/立方米左右,而各地门站价普遍在2元/立方米以下,中央油气企业为保障民生用气价格稳定作出了巨大贡献。第三,高峰期组织“南气北上”,加大储气动用。我们进行了相关测算,国内的自产气、管道气和进口lng以及储气设施必要时的用气,我们已经储备了270亿立方米,能够满足高峰期的用气需要。第四,对可能出现资源偏紧的部分北方地区,及时加强资源调度,兜底保障取暖用气需要。我前面已经讲了,居民用气、取暖用气占比不是很大,我们有能力做好保障。第五,确定了每天3亿立方米的“压非保民”预案——这是预案,争取备而不用,但是一旦用,其一定是管用的。我们最近在组织培训,做好必要演练,必要时有序实施,保障民生用气需要,确保人民群众温暖过冬。总之,我们是有资源、有条件、有能力保障好今冬明春北方地区人民群众的取暖用气需要的。另外,您刚刚提到的有些地方供暖时间会不会有变化?各地开始供暖的时间大致相对固定,通常我们也会根据入冬时当地气温变化情况进行及时调整。近几年,为了更好保障人民群众取暖需要,不少地方取暖的时间都比计划时间提前一些,如果天气冷了、温度低了,会提前供暖。今年从9月下旬开始,随着西北、东北部分地区天气转冷,像新疆北部、黑龙江北部的一些县城,还有内蒙古北部等地区,已经陆续开始供暖。总之,保障人民群众取暖的能源供应是充足的,请全社会放心。谢谢。寿小丽:感谢各位发布人,也感谢各位记者朋友们的参与,今天的政策例行吹风会就到这里。

"国务院新闻办新闻局副局长、新闻发言人寿小丽:女士们、先生们,大家下午好。欢迎大家出席国务院政策例行吹风会。近日,国务院常务会议对今冬明春电力和煤炭等能源供应保障工作作了进一步部署。为了帮助大家更好了解相关情况,今天我们邀请到国家发展改革委党组成员、秘书长赵辰昕先生,国家能源局副局长余兵先生,国家发展改革委价格司司长万劲松先生,国务院国资委财管运行局负责人刘绍娓女士,国家矿山安监局安全基础司司长孙庆国先生,国家电网有限公司副总工程师兼市场营销部主任李明先生,请他们为大家介绍相关情况,并回答大家感兴趣的问题。下面,我们首先有请赵辰昕先生作介绍。国家发展改革委党组成员、秘书长赵辰昕:各位记者朋友,大家下午好。非常高兴参加今天的政策例行吹风会,与相关部门的同志一起给大家介绍一下近期能源保供工作的相关情况。党中央、国务院高度重视能源供应保障工作。北方地区供暖季很快就要到了,9月底10月初这段时间,习近平总书记就能源供应保障、能源安全、能源产供储销体系建设等相关工作作出重要批示指示。10月8日,李克强总理主持召开国务院常务会议,对做好今冬明春电力和煤炭等能源供应作出了进一步部署,强调要保障群众基本生活和经济平稳运行。韩正副总理也多次召开会议进行专门研究,对相关工作提出明确要求。按照党中央、国务院部署,一段时间以来,国家发展改革委会同相关方面,密切配合、迅速行动,采取了一系列有力有效措施。我把这些措施简单跟大家报告一下。第一,完善和强化跨部门协调机制。按照国务院常务会议要求,结合形势和工作需要,我们进一步完善了煤电油气运保障工作部际协调机制,形成最大合力,统筹协调和督促指导全国煤电油气运保障工作,各部门一起快速梳理当前存在的问题,有针对性并及时解决这些问题。第二,全力推动煤炭增产增供。国庆节期间,煤矿在确保安全的前提下,一直在保持正常生产,相关部门共同推动具备增产潜力的煤矿尽快释放产能。我们加快已核准且基本建成的露天煤矿投产达产,促进停产整改的煤矿依法依规整改、尽早恢复生产。我们优先保障煤炭运输,确保生产的煤炭能够及时运到需要的地方。此外,我们协调增加发电供热企业煤炭中长期合同。第三,合理疏导燃煤发电成本。督促各地切实组织好电力市场化交易,要求不得对市场价格在合理范围内的正常浮动进行不当干预。大家知道,2019年,国家发展改革委出台了深化燃煤发电上网电价形成机制改革的相关政策文件,按照文件要求,市场化交易电量的价格可以在基准电价的基础上向上浮动10%、向下浮动不超过15%。但是,过去确实有一些地方存在一些不合理的限制,它允许下浮,但不希望上浮。现在要坚决停止这种不合理干预。这一段时间,我们一直在继续研究深化改革完善煤电价格市场化形成机制。经过研究,昨天已经印发了相关文件,正在有序推动燃煤发电电量全部进入电力市场。在保持居民、农业、公益性事业用电价格基本稳定的情况下,扩大市场交易电价上下浮动范围,并且做好分类调节。第四,推动煤电机组应发尽发。我们协调电网企业和发电企业,加强电煤保障,快速抢修机组故障,全面启动临时停运发电机组,提高供应保障能力。截至10月9日,东北、华北地区8、9月份曾经临时停运的煤电机组,这些容量已经分别下降了1347万千瓦和1220万千瓦。换句话说,就是东北和华北分别有1347万千瓦机组和1220万千瓦机组已经启动起来,这就增加了负荷保障能力。第五,坚决遏制“两高”项目盲目不合理用能。我们指导有关地区统筹考虑能源保供,统筹考虑产业链、供应链安全等相关因素,有序实施“两高”项目限电,坚决遏制“两高”项目盲目发展。遏制“两高”项目盲目发展,是实现高质量发展的应有之义。限制盲目发展“两高”项目的不合理用电,我们的态度是明确的,也是坚决的。下一步,我们请各地要及时公布不符合要求的“两高”项目名单,对这些项目要坚决限制其违规用能和无序用能。第六,指导地方提升有序用电管理水平。及时调整完善有序用电方案,切实做到合同约定、用户知情,确保方案可执行、可操作,并且能够科学实施。通过以上这六项相关工作,我们采取了一系列措施。应该说,目前已经取得了阶段性成效。国家发展改革委将继续会同有关方面,认真贯彻落实党中央、国务院决策部署,坚持民生优先、坚持系统观念、坚持问题导向、坚持底线思维,充分发挥好煤电油气运保障工作部际协调机制作用,统筹发展和安全、节能与保供、近期与中长期,有序有效开展调控工作,确保今冬明春能源安全稳定供应,确保人民群众温暖过冬,确保经济社会平稳运行。借这个机会,我简单把下一步的重点工作向大家报告一下。第一,切实保障人民群众温暖过冬。我们正在督促有关方面,切实做到发电供热用煤和民生用气中长期合同全覆盖。这里很重要的是,压实地方和企业的属地责任和主体责任,增强主动性和能动性。因为这项工作涉及千千万万人民群众的切身利益,责任非常重大。我们一直要求参与相关工作的同志一定要牢记“人民至上”“发展为了人民”,要用实际行动和工作成效切实保障好冬季取暖用能。我们也在指导各地不断优化、完善有序用能方案,把保民生放在第一位。第二,进一步推动加快释放煤炭先进产能。这个刚才已经讲了,我们已做了相关工作,并且这些工作措施还在不断深化。第三,抓紧落实深化燃煤发电上网电价市场化改革的相关措施。我们近期刚刚印发了新的进一步深化改革文件,并且正在有序推动燃煤发电电量全部进入电力市场。在保持居民、农业、公益性事业用电价格稳定的前提下,将市场交易电价上下浮动的范围分别由不超过10%和15%,调整为上下浮动原则上均不超过20%,并且做好分类调节。对高耗能行业可以由市场交易形成价格,不受上浮20%的限制。而且,在这个政策之下,我们鼓励地方对小微企业和个体工商户用电实行阶段性优惠政策。第四,认真落实缓解煤电企业经营困难的财税金融措施。按照国务院要求,有关部门正在细化完善相关支持措施,也在与金融机构和相关企业进行具体的沟通指导,切实保障煤电企业购煤等合理融资需求。第五,坚决遏制“两高”项目盲目发展。我们在督促地方全面排查“两高”项目情况,对“两高”项目实行清单管理,进行分类处置、动态监控,不符合要求的“两高”项目我们要对其坚决整改,我们要在主要耗煤行业大力推进煤炭节约利用。第六,坚持“全国一盘棋”。我们在工作中,纠正有的地方“一刀切”停产限产或者“运动式”减碳,反对不作为、乱作为,严禁部分地区形成“资源先供本地”这样的小循环和保护主义倾向,严禁地方擅自关停煤矿。第七,坚决压实各方保供责任。我们各个部门在督促地方政府落实能源保供的属地责任,督促主要产煤省和重点煤炭企业按照国家要求,落实增产增供任务,督促中央电力企业全力保障发电机组应发尽发,确保民生用电稳定和电网安全。第八,中长期工作一直要持续推进。我们持之以恒、稳步推进能源产供储销体系建设,统筹好能源保供和低碳转型关系,坚持“先立后破”。我们正在大力推进以沙漠戈壁荒漠为重点的大型风电、光伏基地建设,加快应急备用和调峰电源建设,同时积极推进煤炭、天然气、原油储备以及储能能力建设。我先介绍这些,我和几位同事愿意一起回答大家的提问。谢谢。寿小丽:谢谢赵辰昕秘书长。下面进入提问环节,提问前请大家通报一下各自所在的新闻机构。香港中评社记者:据了解,近期,山西、内蒙古已经对辖区内部煤矿的产量进行了核增,并允许部分已完成全年产量的煤矿在四季度继续生产。请问,是否将会有更多地区采取类似的措施增加煤炭供应?接下来国家发展改革委还将计划采取哪些举措来增产增供?今年冬季采暖用煤能否得到保障?谢谢。赵辰昕:谢谢您的提问。记者朋友们都很敏锐,相信大家都注意到了,今年以来,随着疫情之后经济逐步恢复,全球能源需求都在大幅增加。我们看到各国公布的一些公开数据,今年上半年,美国煤炭消费量同比增长近30%,国际市场上的情况,媒体也都在持续关注,现在各个能源品种的价格都在大幅上涨。比如9月底英国的电价比去年同期,不仅翻倍,并且还要高,天然气价格同比上涨了2.5倍以上。国际lng价格创出历史高位。10月11日,东北亚现货lng价格是35.2美元/百万英热单位,同比上涨5.4倍。10月8日,澳大利亚纽卡斯尔港动力煤价格244美元/吨,同比上涨3.2倍。我们为什么要给大家介绍一下最近看到的这些能源价格的情况呢?这是一种大的全球能源供应形势,这也是我们开展能源保供工作所必须面对的复杂形势。大家知道,我国能源资源禀赋的情况,煤炭在保障国家能源安全中一直在发挥重要作用。确实像刚才这位记者所讲的,根据近期供需形势,山西、内蒙古、陕西等相关地区在保障安全生产的前提下,推动具备增产潜力的煤矿尽快释放先进产能,加快已核准且基本建成的露天煤矿投产达产,促进停产整改的煤矿依法依规整改、尽早恢复生产。前几年,我也一直在参与供给侧结构性改革、去产能等相关工作。我认为,这是在供给侧结构性改革成果得到巩固的情况之下,充分释放现有合法合规煤矿的先进产能,以保障国家能源安全供应的应有之策。中国是世界经济发展的重要引擎,近年来对世界经济增长的贡献率一直保持在30%左右。去年以来,我们成功应对新冠肺炎疫情的冲击,在全球主要经济体中率先复苏,这对于推动全球经济恢复、稳定全球供应链发挥了重要作用。保障好中国的能源供应,确保中国经济持续平稳健康发展,实际上也是在为世界经济、全球经济的稳定恢复提供动力之源。按照党中央、国务院决策部署,国家发展改革委与有关部门共同运用市场化、法治化手段,有力有序做好相关工作,保证煤炭稳定供应,相关省份也在积极采取措施,并且已经取得了阶段性成效。所以说今冬明春煤炭供应是有保障的,我们也有能力保障好能源供应。去年,习近平总书记宣布中国将提高国家自主贡献力度,采取更加有力的政策和措施,力争2030年前二氧化碳排放达到峰值,努力争取2060年前实现碳中和。今年4月22日,习近平总书记出席领导人气候峰会并发表重要讲话,强调中国将严控煤电项目,“十四五”时期严控煤炭消费增长,“十五五”时期逐步减少。实现这些目标,中国要付出极其艰巨的努力,但中国言出必行,将坚定不移加以落实。我们将在保障国内能源供应的同时,确保如期实现碳达峰、碳中和的目标。我们会同相关部门已经在政策上做了大量的顶层设计工作,不断构建碳达峰、碳中和“1+n”政策体系,推出扎扎实实的具体举措。今天的主题,主要是能源保供。所以这方面我就不占用更多的时间,只是简单说几个例子。比如,加快煤电机组改造升级等实实在在的举措。我国现在的煤电机组整体水平在全世界是最先进的,我国度电的煤耗比美国低30克以上。即使在这种情况下,我们仍将进行大规模升级改造,使其更节能、更低碳。昨天,习近平主席在《生物多样性公约》第十五次缔约方大会领导人峰会上再次强调,中国将大力发展可再生能源,在沙漠、戈壁、荒漠地区加快规划建设大型风电光伏基地项目。第一期装机容量约1亿千瓦的项目,近期正在组织开工。我举这几个例子是想说明,我们国家正在采取具体行动。最后我想再强调一下,今冬明春能源供应是能够得到保障的,并且我们也能够统筹兼顾实现既定目标,谢谢。中央广播电视总台央视记者:近一段时间,很多地方都采取了限电措施,给工业生产和居民生活造成了一定的影响。请问,限电的原因是什么?今冬明春电力供应形势怎么样?下一步还将采取哪些措施来保障电力供应?赵辰昕:感谢您的提问。这一段时间很多人都在问这个问题,我们也看到很多专家,包括行业内外的人士,都在做各自的分析研究,并且不少人士也发表了相关看法,正所谓众说纷纭。这到底是什么原因呢?10月8日,李克强总理主持召开国务院常务会议,对有关情况作出了全面分析。会议指出,今年以来国际市场能源价格大幅上涨,国内电力、煤炭供需持续偏紧,多种因素导致近期一些地方出现拉闸限电,给正常经济运行和居民生活带来影响。这个分析判断是非常客观和精准的。国务院常务会议对进一步做好今冬明春电力和煤炭等供应工作也作出了部署。现在大家关心的是,在今冬明春电力、煤炭供求压力依旧比较大的情况下,能源保障供应能不能做到、怎么做到。首先,我想再重复一遍刚才我回答第一个问题时强调过的,我们能够做到保障能源安全稳定供应。到底如何做到呢?我想,那就是相关部门一道,坚定不移落实好党中央、国务院决策部署,把工作落实落细落到位。国家发展改革委将会同煤电油气运保障工作部际协调机制各成员单位,加强运行协调调度,确保电力、煤炭稳定可靠供应。大家更多是关心电力方面的情况,关于保障电力的可靠供应,我想再说几点。第一,保障发电供热用煤。刚才我已经介绍了推进增产增供情况,在此基础上,我们还会继续组织煤炭企业与煤电企业再签订一批中长期合同,实现发电用煤中长期合同全覆盖。会同有关部门和企业,在煤源落实、铁路运力等方面全力加强协调,推动煤炭、电力企业双方签订的中长期合同能够严格执行。指导地方和企业提前制定冬季电力用煤保供方案,做好入冬前的煤炭储备。很多地方,特别有供热需要的地方都在做这些相关工作,而且也有非常重要的进展,确保发电用煤充足供应。第二,保障发电机组有效出力。我们在压实地方的属地责任和电力企业的保供主体责任,加强资源统筹调度,克服困难,全力保障火电机组高比例开机、高负荷出力。督促发电企业做好电煤保障,加强机组运行维护、提升安全生产能力。指导电网企业优化电力运行方式,促进水电、核电、风电、光伏发电等清洁能源发电多发满发。第三,强化大电网余缺互济。充分发挥我国大电网的大范围资源配置优势,加强跨省跨区电力运行统筹协调,在局部地区电力供应偏紧的时候,依靠大电网有效给予支持。健全完善跨省跨区电力市场化交易机制,用足用好刚刚出台的燃煤发电上网电价市场化改革政策,提升市场主体跨省区电力支援积极性。第四,坚决遏制“两高”项目盲目发展。精准管控“两高”项目用能需求,着力严控化石能源消费增长。督促地方全面排查“两高”项目情况,坚决遏制“两高”项目发展。在改革完善煤电价格市场化形成机制中做好分类调节,对高耗能行业由市场交易形成价格,不受上浮的20%限制。第五,坚决保住民生用能。民生用能占整个供应的比重并不高,我们统计,居民用电量占全部用电量的15%左右,民生用气占全部用气的比例不到50%。这些民生用电和用气全额保障没有问题。我们将指导地方和企业坚持民生优先,必要时“压非保民”,科学制定有序用能方案,确保限电不限居民,限气也不限居民。我就回答这些。谢谢。封面新闻记者:我们注意到,目前部分的煤矿紧急扩能。请问这对当下煤炭供应的情况有哪些缓解作用?监管部门如何防止不达标的煤矿以保供为由,扩能增产?谢谢。国家矿山安监局安全基础司司长孙庆国:您问的这个问题很好,这也是我们应急管理部、矿山安监局高度关注的问题,同时感谢您对矿山安全工作的关注,感谢您对矿工生命安全的关心。应急管理部、矿山安监局高度重视煤炭安全保供工作,坚决贯彻落实党中央、国务院关于今冬明春电力能源保供工作的决策部署,多次研究落实措施,充分发挥具备增产潜力的煤矿发挥作用,做到既为保供工作保驾护航,又同时坚守安全底线。从目前工作情况来看,我们已经审核976处煤矿,本着特殊时期特事特办、适当放开、严守底线的原则,逐矿进行安全条件审核。其中有153处煤矿符合安全保供条件,大约增加产能2.2亿吨/年,预计四季度可增加煤炭产量5500万吨,平均日增产达到60万吨,对缓解供需紧张、平抑煤炭价格具有积极作用。但是,我们同时也要看到,紧急扩能必须是有序、有度扩能。我们要坚持“全国一盘棋”的思想,明确扩能增产的审查原则,坚决不允许自行其是、一哄而上,更不允许以保供的名义放松安全标准、突破安全底线,把安全的矿井扩成不安全的矿井,把低风险的矿井扩成高风险的矿井,从而给矿工生命安全带来风险。对于您提的这个问题,我们主要从以下四个方面进行工作,以防止紧急情况下不达标煤矿的扩能。第一,严把审核关口。严防灾害严重矿井、存在重大隐患的矿井、安全保障能力不足的矿井等这些不达标的矿井,以保供的名义“搭便车”,盲目扩能增产。同时,对于纳入保供名单的煤矿,我们要求生产能力主管部门逐矿进行现场核实。对于采掘接续紧张,安全管理团队达不到要求,靠搞“人海战术”增加头面、增加职工劳动强度来扩能增产的一律不允许通过。第二,加强服务和指导。组织专家对重点保供地区的煤矿开展“一对一”的安全技术服务,比如协调科研机构、有关企业的专家对西北地区开展防治水专家会诊,在西北地区重点煤矿当中开展了一系列卓有成效的工作,及时消除隐患、确保安全生产。第三,强化监管监察。重点监察这些保供煤矿是不是按照核定后的能力组织生产。第四,压实保供煤矿安全生产主体责任。督促保供煤矿落实包保责任,加强监督检查,及时解决安全生产当中存在的问题,确保保供煤矿安全保供、稳定保供。谢谢。中国新闻社记者:请问,面对今冬明春较大的电力热力保供压力,国家能源局将采取哪些措施保障好人民群众的温暖过冬?谢谢。国家能源局副局长余兵:谢谢你的提问。今冬明春确实面临比较大的电力、热力保供压力。我们坚决贯彻党中央、国务院的决策部署,经过前一阶段的工作,在各方努力下,自10月份以来,全国电力供需紧张形势已经有所缓解。10月11日,全国日发电量207亿千瓦时,当月累计发电量2285亿千瓦时,同比增长10.8%。截至目前,年累计发电量已经达到62749亿千瓦时,同比增长13.1%。应该说,这个增长量还是比较大的。全国统调电煤库存8199万吨,目前可用天数是15天。10月11日全国合计有序用电电力4842万千瓦,有序用电量已经比9月份最高峰有所下降。为了确保当前电力稳定供应,国家能源局采取了三个方面的措施。一是开展电力供应保障形势研判和问题会商。近期,国家能源局多次召开专题会议,会商研判电力保供形势,加强电力运行监测,并且赴中国气象局、国家电网公司、国家能源集团等有关单位和企业开展调研、会商,科学研判今冬明春气象情况和电力煤炭保供情况,做好预案。会同有关方面全力以赴做好煤炭增产增供,优先保障发电供暖用煤。二是继续推动各类电源项目建设和投产工作。推动具备条件的支撑性电源投产,缓解电力供应紧张。结合“十四五”可再生能源发展规划,会同有关方面加快推进大型风电、光伏基地建设,推动具备条件的应急储备电源和热电尽快投产。1月—9月,风电投产超过1400万千瓦,光伏投产超过2200万千瓦,能够适当缓解电力供应紧张的局面。三是缓解煤电企业经营压力。配合国家发展改革委做好燃煤发电上网电价市场化改革相关工作,从价格机制等方面推进电力安全稳定供应,缓解煤电企业压力。下一步,国家能源局还将采取四个方面的措施确保今冬明春电力和热力供应。一是加强电力热力供应形势监测预警。会同有关部门开展全国迎峰度冬气候趋势预测,研判对能源保供可能产生的影响,重点关注民生用电用热的保障,守住民生的底线。督促电力行业做好应对极端天气和自然灾害、突发事件的应急准备工作。二是全力做好迎峰度冬电力热力保供工作。督促各地在建的具备条件的支撑性电源及时投产发挥作用,推动条件成熟的大型风电、光伏基地开工建设。指导有关企业加强设备维护、检修管理,保障机组稳定出力。督导重点城市确定电力保供应急方案,东北等地区要坚持“以热定电、以热为先”的原则,做好今冬明春电力热力的保障工作。三是强化北方地区清洁取暖工作。我们印发了《关于做好2021年北方地区清洁取暖工作的通知》,多措并举保障清洁取暖用能,科学制定极端天气应急预案。四是继续加强能源监管工作。督促各地将国家重大能源政策和各项调控保供措施落实到位,确保今冬明春能源稳定供应,确保居民用能安全。我们也有“12398”能源监管热线,及时将群众反映的问题交相关单位协调解决,切实回应好人民群众用能诉求。谢谢。中国县域经济报记者:提一个关于各界关注的电价问题。请问,是否有计划上调居民和工业电价来弥补电厂由于煤炭价格上涨造成的损失?谢谢。国家发展改革委价格司司长万劲松:刚才赵辰昕秘书长在介绍当中已经回答了这个问题,我愿意借这个机会再跟大家对电价改革有关情况作一下介绍。10月8日,国务院常务会议对做好今冬明春煤炭和电力供应保障工作作出了一系列部署。国家发展改革委贯彻落实国务院常务会议精神,迅速出台了《关于进一步深化燃煤发电上网电价市场化改革的通知》,昨天全文已正式对外发布。我先给大家介绍一下背景情况。近年来,我们按照党中央、国务院决策部署,一直持续推动电价市场化改革。目前已经有70%的燃煤发电电量、40%以上的工商业用户进入电力市场,价格由市场形成。燃煤发电上网电价机制,刚才赵秘书长已经介绍了,原来实行标杆电价,2019年改成“基准价+上下浮动”的市场化电价形成机制,当时规定的幅度是上浮不超过10%、下浮原则上不超过15%,燃煤发电上网电价大部分已经市场化了。这次改革的主要内容有四个方面,可以简要概括为“两个有序放开、一个扩大、一个稳定”。“两个有序放开”。第一个是有序放开全部燃煤发电电量的上网电价。刚才我们已经说了,目前已经有70%以上的燃煤发电电价是由市场形成,剩余30%的燃煤发电电量也要全部进入市场,在“基准价+上下浮动”范围内,通过市场交易来形成上网电价。第二个是有序放开工商业用户用电价格。目前已有40%以上的工商业用户通过市场来购电,在此基础上有序推动其他工商业用户进入市场,按照市场价格购电,同步取消工商业目录销售电价。对暂时还没有从市场购电的用户,建立起电网企业代理购电机制。所谓代理购电,就是电网企业向这些工商业用户供电,不再按照目录销售电价(因为目录销售电价已经取消了),而是按照市场价格,根据购进价格的变化,销售价格也会相应调整。“一个扩大”,就是扩大市场交易电价的上下浮动范围。前面也提到了,现行的规定是上浮不超过10%,下浮原则上不超过15%,这次统一扩大为上下浮动原则上均不超过20%,其中特别强调对高耗能企业市场交易电价不受上浮20%的限制。“一个稳定”,这也是这次改革一个特别重要的内容,就是我们保持居民、农业、公益性事业用电价格稳定。居民、农业、公益性事业用电仍然是由电网企业保障供应,还是执行目前价格水平不变。这次改革标志着在“放开两头”,即放开上网侧和销售侧电价方面,迈出了重要一步,核心就是建立起了“能跌能涨”的市场化电价形成机制。从短期来看,这次改革有利于进一步理顺“煤电”关系,保障电力安全稳定供应。从长期来说,可以用“四个推动”来概括它的意义。一是加快推动电力市场建设发展,这个电力市场包括电力中长期交易、现货市场和辅助服务市场;二是推动电力行业高质量发展;三是推动新型电力系统构建;四是推动能源绿色低碳转型。谢谢。彭博社记者:中国最近推出了政策推动支持煤炭生产。这些政策会永久存在吗?会不会影响国家双碳目标的实现?谢谢。赵辰昕:感谢彭博社记者的提问。其实,我在回答刚才其他问题的时候已经谈到了。根据中国资源禀赋情况,煤炭在保障国家能源安全中一直发挥着重要作用。近期,我们释放煤炭先进产能,释放的都是合法合规煤矿,这种释放是按照市场化、法治化办法来推进的。相关政策一直坚持市场在资源配置中发挥决定性作用,还有一点,就是更好发挥政府的作用,这两条是我们一直在坚持的。至于您提到的释放煤炭先进产能是不是会影响到实现碳达峰、碳中和目标,其实我刚才已经讲到了,我们有能力保障我国能源的安全稳定供应。我们在做工作的时候,一直坚持系统思维、统筹兼顾。中国人言出必行,我们宣布的目标一定会坚定不移完成。谢谢。第一财经记者:中央企业提供了全国近1/4的煤炭产量,为全国的电煤供应发挥了重要作用。请问国资委,作为能源的国家队,国资央企在助力能源保供稳价方面将有哪些新的举措?谢谢。国务院国资委财管运行局负责人刘绍娓:首先,谢谢您的提问。非常感谢各位媒体朋友长期以来对国资央企改革发展事业的关心和支持。就如您刚才所说的,中央企业是我国能源供应的主力军,承担了90%以上的油气供应,承担了60%以上的电力供应,承担了25%以上的煤炭供应。近年来,在新冠肺炎疫情防控以及抗震抗洪救灾这样一些紧要关头,中央企业都是冲在了一线,敢于碰硬、敢打硬仗,全力保障电力、油气、通信、医疗、粮食物资等稳定供应,发挥了关键时期顶得上、顶得住的“顶梁柱”作用。尤其是自今年以来,面对煤炭电力供应紧张的局面,中央企业讲政治、顾大局,讲使命、担责任,积极增产扩销稳供。1月—9月,央企的煤机发电量同比增长14.4%,高于全社会用电量的增幅1.5个百分点。煤炭产量同比增长5.9%,高于全国煤炭产业增幅1.5个百分点,这充分体现了央企作为“大国重器”的责任担当。9月底,个别地区出现拉闸限电现象,国资委和中央企业坚决贯彻党中央、国务院决策部署,积极作为、勇担重任,第一时间采取了有力有效的应急举措。带头增加煤炭供应,全力保障供电安全,为缓解当前缺电限电局面作出积极努力和贡献。从国资委层面来看,主要做到了“四个迅速”。一是迅速开展全线动员。9月27日下午国务院召开专题会议,国资委主要负责同志当晚就紧急召集14家央企能源企业主要负责人召开专题会议,部署央企保供工作。9月30日下午,国资委有关负责同志再次组织在京能源央企召开专题会,进行再部署、再督促,进一步明确工作要求。二是迅速组建火线专班。国资委第一时间成立了国资委领导担任组长的保供工作专班,建立了工作日报、督促落实、考核约束和政策协调四个工作机制,全力推动保供工作。三是迅速深入一线督导。10月1日,国资委主要负责同志带队到7家在京电力煤炭央企现场调研督导,并和南方电网视频连线督导。10月11日,国资委有关负责同志带队到内蒙古宝日希勒等煤矿实地督导调研,督促企业加快释放先进产能。四是迅速实施红线考核。国资委紧急研究确定了今冬明春能源供应保障专项奖惩办法,把保供工作作为相关央企主要考核指标,对作出特殊贡献的企业予以考核奖励,对工作不力、造成保供事故的实行一票否决、并严肃追责。从中央企业层面,把保障东北地区能源电力供应安全作为当前保供的重中之重,做到了“四个全力以赴”。一是全力以赴稳量稳价,积极发挥中央煤炭企业“风向标”的作用。在确保安全生产的前提下,多措并举释放先进产能,坚决做到“能采尽采、能产尽产”。自10月1日以来,央企东北煤矿日均产煤比节前前四天平均产量增长23%。同时,带头多签中长期合同,努力稳定市场价格,国家能源集团和中煤集团两家中央煤炭企业中长协合同兑现率超过90%,向下游企业让利超过500亿。二是全力以赴供电供暖,积极发挥中央发电企业“压舱石”作用。中国华能、中国大唐、中国华电、国家电投等企业克服“买不到煤、买不起煤”的困难,在越发越亏的情况下,仍然不惜成本、不计代价,抢煤补库,并抓紧抢修机组故障,全力启动临停机组,坚决做到“能开尽开、能发尽发”。自9月27日以来,新开临停机组2239万千瓦,净增1037.5万千瓦。截至10月11日,中央企业东北电厂存煤量比9月27日增长28%,煤炭库存平均可用天数增长44%。三是全力以赴保民保农,积极发挥中央电网企业“主力军”的作用。国家电网和南方电网全面启动应急机制,加强运行监测和负荷预测,保障各类电源“能并尽并、能用尽用”。坚持“需求响应优先,有序用电保底”,优化控制策略、严肃调度纪律,确保民生用电、农业用电不受影响,坚决落实“限电不拉闸”。自9月27日以来,电网企业东北地区日均发受电量稳定在12亿千瓦时以上,没有再发生拉闸限电事故。四是全力以赴增产增供,积极发挥中央油气企业“稳定器”作用。中国石油、中国石化、中国海油、国家管网等企业持续加强气源供给管理,大力推进国产气增储上产,积极扩大进口天然气资源,组织“南气北上”重点保障北方地区群众取暖用气。认真落实资源气量、合同气量、储采气量、调峰气量,坚决做到“限气不关阀”。1月—9月,中央石油石化企业国内天然气产量同比增长9.3%,进口天然气气量同比增长24.7%,采暖用气保障能力显著增强。下一步,国资委和中央企业将深入贯彻习近平总书记“以人民为中心”的发展思想,始终牢记“国之大者”,从维护国家能源安全和经济安全的高度出发,坚持系统观念,坚守民生用能底线,以更高标准、更大力度、更细措施全力做好供煤、供暖、供气工作,坚决打好打赢今冬明春保供攻坚战,为确保人民群众温暖过冬,维护国民经济平稳运行积极贡献国资央企力量。海报新闻记者:近期,多个省份出现了用电紧张的情况。请问,电网企业在应对电力供需紧张方面采取了哪些措施?谢谢。国家电网有限公司副总工程师兼市场营销部主任李明:感谢你的提问。自今年年初以来,我国经济稳定恢复,支撑电力需求保持了旺盛增长。1月—9月,国家电网经营区全社会用电量达到4.8万亿千瓦时,同比增长近13%。迎峰度夏期间,最大负荷达到9.48亿千瓦,同比增长8.3%,多地省级电网最大负荷超过历史最高水平。自9月份以来,电力供需形势持续紧张,国家电网经营区有17个省份实施了有序用电,日最大规模已经超过了3900万千瓦,影响程度远超今年年初极寒天气和夏季负荷高峰时段。党中央、国务院高度重视保暖保供保民生工作。近期,政府部门多次召开会议作出部署,国家电网有限公司坚决落实,第一时间建立了保供电应急机制,成立领导小组、协调小组,建立了日报告、日协调、日会商制度,出台有力措施,全力以赴保安全、保供电、保民生。可以说,有效保障了国庆期间电力有序供应。即将进入冬季,这个期间北方地区处于用电高峰期,又是水电枯水期,水电电量大幅下降,还有热电联产机组供暖期,这是“三期相遇”。这个时期电力需求将进一步增长,我们预计最大负荷将达到10亿千瓦,超过历史同期的9.7亿千瓦电力水平。总体来看,在这个期间还是一个紧平衡状态,局部也存在硬缺口,电网的保供电压力还是较大的。国家电网作为央企,将牢牢扛起电力保供电责任,始终坚持以人民为中心的发展理念,认真践行“人民电业为人民”的企业宗旨,以更高标准、更严要求、更细举措、更实作风,全力做好今冬明春电力保供工作。具体措施如下:一是要充分发挥大电网资源优化配置优势,统筹电力电量平衡。二是加强发电机组并网管理,保障各类电源“能并尽并、能用尽用”。三是配合政府科学优化并严格执行有序用电方案,严格管控“两高”项目用电需求。四是强化优质服务,及时响应客户诉求、回应社会关切,坚决守住大电网安全和民生用电底线,与大家一道守护好万家灯火。谢谢。红星新闻记者:国家矿山安全监察局近日要求,严防停产整顿矿、长期停产矿等6类矿井铤而走险违规生产。如何在能源保供的同时,做好不盲目增产并压实安全责任?谢谢。孙庆国:国家矿山安全监察局近日发出通知要求,严防停产整顿、长期停产等6类矿井铤而走险,防止其违法生产、发生事故,给保供大局带来不利影响。从这个方面来说,我刚才也讲了,在紧急情况下,煤炭供需紧张,扩能必须是有序扩能、有度增产。要坚持“一盘棋”的思想,坚决不允许自行其是、一哄而上,也坚决不允许以保供的名义来突破安全底线,要把煤矿安全生产工作放在一个最重要的位置。为了防止盲目增产和压实责任,我们主要做了以下四个方面的工作。第一,迅速严格进行安全审查。上一位记者也提出了类似的问题,我们将对于灾害严重的矿井、对于存在重大隐患的矿井、对于瓦斯经常超限的矿井、对于下井人员超标的矿井、对于搞“人海战术”,靠增加采掘工作面来增产保供,像这样的安全保障程度比较低的煤矿,我们是坚决不允许其打着保供的名义来盲目增产的。同时,我们也要严格进行现场审查,对每一个保供的煤矿都要派出专家队伍,到煤矿现场审查各个生产系统、审查管理制度、审查管理团队、审查其是否都达到要求,防止不具备安全生产条件的煤矿盲目扩能增产。第二,加强服务指导,做到既为保供保驾护航,又守住安全底线。这个保驾护航就是对保供的煤矿加强服务和指导。比如刚才讲过了对西北地区协调科研机构、煤炭企业的专家,开展了防治水专家会诊。对灾害严重的矿井省份,我们组织30多位业内知名专家以及40多家科研机构,开展了科技进企业的活动,指导帮助各地和煤矿企业辨识、管控重大风险,排查治理重大隐患,提高煤矿灾害治理能力,这样也为能源保供提供一个安全、稳定的环境。第三,加强监督检查,确保安全生产。10月份,国家矿山安监局将对10个省(区)和新疆生产建设兵团开展矿山安全生产综合督查,同时组织两轮异地执法检查,紧盯刚才提到的停产整顿煤矿、长期停工停产煤矿、技改重组煤矿、即将关闭煤矿、大班次煤矿和保供煤矿六类煤矿开展执法检查,严厉打击违法违规行为。这6类煤矿,除了保供煤矿之外,其余的5类煤矿都是非正常生产煤矿。应该说,其安全风险很大,对职工生命安全威胁很大。增产保供煤矿由于生产组织发生变化,也带来一定的风险。这是我们关注的重点,也是严防漏管失控的重点。第四,进一步压实责任,这个责任分为两个方面。对于监管监察部门来说,就是要严格按照《关于进一步压实矿山安全监管监察责任切实消除监管盲区的通知》要求,将各类矿山都纳入监管监察范围,压实每一处矿山的安全监管责任,明确负责人员并向社会进行公布,消除监管盲区。对煤矿企业来说,就是要严格落实安全生产主体责任,落实领导干部的包保责任,同时要深入研判安全风险、制定管控措施、加强监督检查、加强现场管理,切实对发现的问题督促、研究并及时整改到位,确保煤矿安全平稳生产。这样为整个煤炭供应提供一个良好的安全生产环境,守护好安全生产的底线,守护好矿工生命安全。谢谢。寿小丽:大家对能源保供问题高度关注,还有不少记者举手。由于时间关系,我们提最后两个问题。南方都市报记者:近期,受我国经济持续恢复和国际大宗能源原材料价格上涨影响,我国煤炭消费超预期增长,供需偏紧。请问,国家能源局已经采取了哪些煤炭稳产增产措施?下一步还将采取哪些措施稳定煤炭生产?谢谢。余兵:谢谢你的提问。国家能源局认真贯彻落实党中央、国务院关于能源保供的决策部署,积极会同有关部门、重点产煤省区细化措施,全力以赴做好煤炭增产增供工作,近期主要开展了以下几个方面的工作。一是现场督导煤炭增产增供。我们到产煤地区现场了解煤矿的生产运行情况(有的下了井),督促在保障安全的前提下进一步挖掘增产潜力,优先保障发电、供暖等民生用煤。二是消除不合理的限产措施。刚才国家矿山安全监察局孙司长也说了,我们一道印发了相关通知,指导产煤地区和有关中央企业全力以赴做好煤炭生产供应,各类生产煤矿按照设计(核定)生产能力正常组织生产,实现增产增供。三是压紧压实煤炭增产增供责任。分省跟进督促,要求各产煤省区和煤炭企业提高政治站位、强化责任担当,把煤炭增产增供作为当前的重要任务盯紧抓实。四是国庆期间针对性开展督促和检查。坚持每天到岗值守,并且与产煤地区的有关部门保持联系,重点了解煤矿是否正常生产,帮助其协调解决突出问题,充分利用节假日用煤低谷,把煤电供暖企业煤炭库存提上来。五是强化煤炭产量调度。坚持全国产煤地区的煤炭产量日调度,增加重点煤炭企业产量旬调度,分析研判煤炭生产形势,及时帮助破解制约煤炭增产的瓶颈。六是研究进一步释放产能。我们和国家矿山安全监察局一道,正在梳理有增产增供潜力的煤矿名单,准备再释放一批产能。通过上述一些措施,应该说煤炭产量取得较为显著的增长。近日,煤炭日产量已经稳定在1120万吨以上,比国庆节前增加了80万吨,创造了今年2月份以来的新高。从重点的产煤地区来看,晋陕蒙日均产煤量已经超过800万吨,发挥了大省大矿作用。下一步,国家能源局将继续坚决贯彻落实好党中央、国务院关于能源保供的决策部署,统筹增产保供和安全环保,紧盯煤炭生产,积极协调增产增供过程中的突出问题,着力释放优质产能、有效产能,确保今冬明春煤炭产量在较高水平保持稳定。重点是盯好产煤大省(区)产能大矿,充分发挥其顶梁柱和主力军作用,对产能利用率高、已经达产的省区,督促其持续稳产,抓好安全生产,避免因为安全事故停产造成产量波动。对产能利用率偏低、仍有增产潜力的省(区),将及时督促指导,并帮助其解决实际困难,尽快把产量提上来,实现安全增产增供。此外,国家能源局将督促指导有关方面将国家已经出台的各项措施落实落地,推进建设煤矿尽快投产达产,加快产能核增、加快产能释放,有序有效增加煤炭供应。密切关注迎峰度冬煤炭保供形势,突出抓好东北等重点地区煤炭保供,优先保障发电供暖用煤,确保人民群众温暖过冬。谢谢。凤凰卫视记者:北方即将进入供暖季,目前天然气供应储备情况如何?近期国际天然气价格暴涨,冬季供暖用气需求是否能够保障?另外,据说西北、东北部分地区供暖计划时间比往年延后,请问这是否是由于资源供应方面的问题?谢谢。赵辰昕:谢谢凤凰卫视记者的提问。保障北方地区人民群众取暖用气需要,是冬季天然气保供的首要任务。这些年,我们一直在做天然气的冬季保供工作,积累了不少经验。今年以来,国家发展改革委会同各地区、有关部门和企业,坚持以人民为中心的发展思想,提前做了大量准备工作,持续大力推进天然气产供储销体系建设,这些工作为冬季天然气保供提供了重要基础。截至目前,我们已经落实供暖季保供资源量1744亿立方米,还在进一步组织企业挖掘增产增供潜力。从天然气储备情况看,供暖季全国可形成储气量270亿立方米以上。目前,各大地下储气库已基本完成注气,为冬季保供打下了坚实基础。针对近期国际气价大幅上涨的严峻形势,我们会加紧把相关的工作进一步落实落细,多措并举切实保障北方地区取暖用气需要,重点开展以下几项工作:第一,督促供需双方严格按照签订合同保障供用气。目前各地签订的合同量比去年实际消费量都有不小的增长,对北方地区取暖用气需要可以做到合同全覆盖。第二,督促各地和相关企业严格执行居民用气门站价格政策,保持取暖等民生用气价格基本稳定,将国际气价上涨的影响降低到可控范围。当前,国际市场lng现货到岸价格达到9元/立方米左右,而各地门站价普遍在2元/立方米以下,中央油气企业为保障民生用气价格稳定作出了巨大贡献。第三,高峰期组织“南气北上”,加大储气动用。我们进行了相关测算,国内的自产气、管道气和进口lng以及储气设施必要时的用气,我们已经储备了270亿立方米,能够满足高峰期的用气需要。第四,对可能出现资源偏紧的部分北方地区,及时加强资源调度,兜底保障取暖用气需要。我前面已经讲了,居民用气、取暖用气占比不是很大,我们有能力做好保障。第五,确定了每天3亿立方米的“压非保民”预案——这是预案,争取备而不用,但是一旦用,其一定是管用的。我们最近在组织培训,做好必要演练,必要时有序实施,保障民生用气需要,确保人民群众温暖过冬。总之,我们是有资源、有条件、有能力保障好今冬明春北方地区人民群众的取暖用气需要的。另外,您刚刚提到的有些地方供暖时间会不会有变化?各地开始供暖的时间大致相对固定,通常我们也会根据入冬时当地气温变化情况进行及时调整。近几年,为了更好保障人民群众取暖需要,不少地方取暖的时间都比计划时间提前一些,如果天气冷了、温度低了,会提前供暖。今年从9月下旬开始,随着西北、东北部分地区天气转冷,像新疆北部、黑龙江北部的一些县城,还有内蒙古北部等地区,已经陆续开始供暖。总之,保障人民群众取暖的能源供应是充足的,请全社会放心。谢谢。寿小丽:感谢各位发布人,也感谢各位记者朋友们的参与,今天的政策例行吹风会就到这里。"}

was that sort of the division ? grad f : right . professor b : so which week are we in ? grad f : well we have n't really started , but i thought we more we more or less did meeting recorder stuff last week , so i thought we could do , uh professor b : i thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week too . phd c : yeah . grad f : but i figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each . professor b : yeah . grad f : so . i seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted . here we go . so , uh , as most of you should know , i did send out the consent form thingies and , uh , so far no one has made any ach ! { comment } { comment } any comments on them . so , no on no one has bleeped out anything . professor b : um . yeah . grad f : so . i do n't expect anyone to . but . professor b : um . so , w what follows ? at some point y you go around and get people to sign something ? grad f : no . we had spoken w about this before professor b : yeah , but i 've forgotten . grad f : and we had decided that they have they only needed to sign once . and the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity . so as long as we do that , we 're covered . professor b : and how long of an opportunity did you tell them ? grad f : uh , july fifteenth . professor b : july fifteenth . oh , so they have a plenty of time , and y given that it 's that long , um , um why was that date chosen ? you just felt you wanted to ? grad f : jane told me july fifteenth . so , that 's what i set it . postdoc a : oh . i just meant that that was the release date that you had on the data . professor b : oh , ok . grad f : oh . i i did n't understand that there was something specific . postdoc a : i , uh i thought grad f : you y you had professor b : i do n't grad f : i had heard july fifteenth , so that 's what i put . postdoc a : mm - hmm . professor b : no , the only th the only mention i recall about that was just that july fifteenth or so is when this meeting starts . postdoc a : that 's right . that 's why . professor b : oh , i see . postdoc a : you said you wanted it to be available then . i did n't mean it to be the hard deadline . professor b : right . postdoc a : it 's fine with me if it is , or we cou but i thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that in case , uh you know , `` by the way this is your last `` professor b : right . postdoc a : uh . yeah . professor b : we probably should have talked about it , cuz i because if we wan na be able to give it to people july fifteenth , if somebody 's gon na come back and say `` ok , i do n't want this and this and this used `` , uh , clearly we need some time to respond to that . right ? grad f : yeah . as i said , we i just got one date professor b : yeah . phd h : damn ! grad f : and that 's the one i used . professor b : yeah . grad f : so . but i can send a follow - up . i mean , it 's almost all us . i mean the people who are in the meeti this meeting was , uh , these the meetings that in are in set one . phd c : was my was my response ok ? postdoc a : that 's right . phd c : i just wrote you replied to the email saying they 're all fine . grad f : right . i mean , that 's fine . phd c : ok , good . grad f : i we do n't my understanding of what we had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that , uh , we do n't actually need a reply . phd c : that makes it easy . grad f : we just need to tell them that they can do it if they want . professor b : ok . i just did n't remember , but grad f : and so no reply is no changes . postdoc a : and he 's got it so that the default thing you see when you look at the page is `` ok `` . so that 's very clear all the way down the page , `` ok `` . and they have two options they can change it to . one of them is `` censor `` , and the other one is `` incorrect `` . is it is your word is `` incorrect `` ? grad f : right . postdoc a : which means also we get feedback on if um , there 's something that they w that needs to be adjusted , because , i mean , these are very highly technical things . i mean , it 's an added , uh , level of checking on the accuracy of the transcription , as i see it . but in any case , people can agree to things that are wrong . grad f : well yeah . the reason i did that it was just so that people would not censor not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly , postdoc a : and the reason i liked it was because grad f : as opposed to , uh postdoc a : was because it , um it gives them the option of , uh , being able to correct it . grad f : right . postdoc a : approve it and correct it . and um . so , you have it nicely set up so they email you and , uh grad f : when they submit the form , it gets processed and emailed to me . postdoc a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . and i wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are robustness and meeting recorder . the german ones will be ready for next week . those are three three of those . a different set of people . and we can impose phd c : the german ones ? postdoc a : uh , well . phd h : yeah . those uh postdoc a : ok . i spoke loosely . the the german , french sorry , the german , dutch , and spanish ones . phd e : spanish . yeah . grad f : mm - hmm . phd c : oh , those are the nsa meetings ? phd e : the non - native phd h : those are postdoc a : yeah . uh - huh . professor b : german , dutch , swiss and spanish . phd c : oh , oh ! ok . phd e : the all non - native postdoc a : that 's that 's that 's r grad f : mm - hmm . phd h : uh - huh . phd c : ok . i 'd i d postdoc a : yeah . it 's the other group . professor b : i it was the network network services group . postdoc a : uh - huh . yeah , exactly . yeah . professor b : yeah . postdoc a : i did n't mean to isolate them . professor b : otherwise known as the german , dutch , and spanish . postdoc a : yeah . sorry . it was it was not the best characterization . grad f : mm - hmm . postdoc a : but what what i meant to say was that it 's the other group that 's not n no m no overlap with our present members . and then maybe it 'd be good to set an explicit deadline , something like a week before that , uh , j july fifteenth date , or two weeks before . professor b : i mean , i would suggest we discuss i mean , if we 're going to have a policy on it , that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people , grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : so that we have a uniform thing . so , tha that 's a month , which is fine . i mean , it seems phd c : twelve hours . grad f : well , the only thing i said in the email is that the data is going to be released on the fifteenth . i did n't give any other deadline . postdoc a : mm - hmm . grad f : so my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says , `` wow i suddenly found something `` , we 'll delete it from our record . we just wo n't delete it from whatever 's already been released . postdoc a : hmm . that 's a little bit difficult . grad f : what else can we do ? postdoc a : yeah . grad f : if someone says `` hey , look , i found something in this meeting and it 's libelous and i want it removed `` . what can we do ? postdoc a : well . that 's true . grad f : we have to remove it . postdoc a : i i agree with that part , but i think that it would it , uh we need to have , uh , a a a message to them very clearly that beyond this date , you ca n't make additional changes . professor b : i mean , um , i i i i think that somebody might request something even though we say that . but i think it 's good to at least start some place like that . postdoc a : mm - hmm . good . professor b : so if we agreed , ok , how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have if we say two weeks , or if we say a month , i think we should just say that say that , you know , i a as um , `` per the the the , uh , page you signed , you have the ability to look over this stuff `` and so forth `` and , uh , because we w `` these , uh i would i would imagine some sort of generic thing that would say `` because we , uh , will continually be making these things available to other researchers , uh , this ca n't be open - ended and so , uh , uh , please give us back your response within this am you know , within this amount of time `` , whatever time we agree upon . grad f : well , did you read the email and look at the pages i sent ? professor b : did i ? no , i have n't yet . no , just grad f : no . ok , well why do n't you do that and then make comments on what you want me to change ? professor b : no , no . i 'm not saying that you should change anything . i i 'm what i 'm what i 'm i 'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully among people who have read it so that that you can you can , uh , decide on something . postdoc a : mm - hmm . professor b : so i 'm not telling you what to decide . postdoc a : mm - hmm . professor b : i 'm just saying you should decide something , and then grad f : i already did decide something , and that 's what 's in the email . postdoc a : yeah , yeah . ok , so grad f : and if you disagree with it , why do n't you read it and give me comments on it ? postdoc a : yeah . well i i think that there 's one missing line . professor b : well , the one thing that i did read and that you just repeated to me was that you gave the specific date of july fifteenth . grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : and you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you . so what i 'm telling you is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough grad f : right . professor b : and you should use that rather than this date that you just got from somewhere . that 's all i 'm saying . postdoc a : i ha i have one question . this is in the summer period and presumably people may be out of town . but we can make the assumption , ca n't we ? that , um , they will be receiving email , uh , most of the month . right ? because if someone professor b : it well , it well , you 're right . sometimes somebody will be away and , uh , you know , there 's , uh for any length of time that you uh , choose there is some person sometime who will not end up reading it . that 's it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take . phd h : s so maybe when am i on , by the way ? grad f : i do n't know . you should be . phd h : oh . hello ? hello ? grad f : you should be channel b . phd h : oh , ok . alright . so . the , um maybe we should say in w you know , when the whole thing starts , when they sign the the agreement that you know , specify exactly uh , what , you know , how how they will be contacted and they can , you know they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address , or both . and , um , then postdoc a : we did that , i i believe . phd h : right . phd e : yeah . phd h : so . a and , then , you know , say very clearly that if they do n't if we do n't hear from them , you know , as morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain period after we contact them that is implicitly giving their agreement . grad f : well , they 've already signed a form . postdoc a : and the form says phd e : and nobody nobody really reads it anyway . phd h : right . grad f : so . and the s and the form was approved by human subjects , phd h : says that . right . postdoc a : uh , the f phd h : well , if that 's i tha if that 's already if grad f : so , eh , that 's gon na be a little hard to modify . postdoc a : well , the form well , the form does n't say , if uh , you know , `` if you do n't respond by x number of days or x number of weeks `` phd h : i see . uh oh , ok . so what does it say about the the the process of of , uh y the review process ? postdoc a : it does n't have a time limit . that you 'll be provided access to the transcripts and then , uh , allowed to remove things that you 'd like to remove , before it goes to the general uh , larger audience . phd h : oh , ok . hmm . right . grad f : here . postdoc a : there you go . grad f : you can read what you already signed . phd e : i guess when i read it , um i 'm not as diligent as chuck , but i had the feeling i should probably respond and tell adam , like , `` i got this and i will do it by this date , and if you do n't hear from me by then `` you know , in other words responding to your email once , right away , saying `` as soon as you get this could you please respond . `` grad f : right . phd e : and then if you if the person thinks they 'll need more time because they 're out of town or whatever , they can tell you at that point ? because grad f : oh , i just i did n't wan na do that , because i do n't wan na have a discussion with every person if i can avoid it . phd e : well , it 's grad f : so what i wanted to do was just send it out and say `` on the fifteenth , the data is released , postdoc a : mm - hmm . grad f : if you wan na do something about it , do something about it , but that 's it `` . postdoc a : i i kind of like this . phd e : well postdoc a : yeah . phd e : ok . so , we 're assuming that phd h : well , that 's that would be great if but you should probably have a legal person look at this and make sure it 's ok . because if you if you , uh , do this and you then there 's a dispute later and , uh , some you know , someone who understands these matters concludes that they did n't have , uh , you know , enough opportunity to actually exercise their their right phd e : or they they might never have gotten the email , because although they signed this , they do n't know by which date to expect your email . and so someone whose machine is down or whatever i mean , we have no professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : in internally we know that people are there , grad f : well , ok . l let me let me reverse this . phd e : but we have no confirmation that they got the mail . grad f : so let 's say someone i send this out , and someone does n't respond . do we delete every meeting that they were in ? phd e : well , then grad f : i do n't think so . phd e : it we 're hoping that does n't happen , but that 's why there 's such a thing as registered mail grad f : that will happen . phd e : or phd h : that will happen . phd e : right . grad f : that will absolutely happen . because people do n't read their email , or they 'll read and say `` i do n't care about that , i 'm not gon na delete anything `` and they don just wo n't reply to it . phd h : maybe uh , do we have mailing addresses for these people ? grad f : no . we have what they put on the speaker form , postdoc a : well { comment } most grad f : which was just generic contact information . postdoc a : but the ones that we 're dealing with now are all local , phd h : well , then postdoc a : except the ones who i mean , we we 're totally in contact with all the ones in those two groups . phd h : mmm . ok . postdoc a : so maybe , uh , i you know , that 's not that many people and if i if , uh i i there is an advantage to having them admit and if i can help with with processing that , i will . it 's it 's there is an advantage to having them be on record as having received the mail and indicating grad f : yeah . i mean i thought we had discussed this , like , a year ago . postdoc a : yes , we did . grad f : and so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again . postdoc a : you 're right . well , i you know . but sometimes professor b : well , we we have n't experienced it before . postdoc a : that 's right . professor b : right ? so phd e : you 'll either wonder at the beginning or you 'll wonder at the end . postdoc a : need to get it right . phd e : i mean , there 's no way to get around i it 's pretty much the same am amount of work except for an additional email just saying they got the email . postdoc a : yeah . phd e : and maybe it 's better legally to wonder before you know , a little bit earlier than grad f : well postdoc a : it 's much easier to explain this way . grad f : ok . well , why do n't you talk t postdoc a : t t to have it on record . grad f : morgan , can you talk to our lawyer about it , and find out what the status is on this ? cuz i do n't wan na do something that we do n't need to . postdoc a : yeah , but w mmm . grad f : because what i 'm telling you , people wo n't respond to the email . no matter what you do , you there 're gon na be people who you 're gon na have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with . postdoc a : well , then we make the effort . grad d : i mean , i it 's k grad f : and do we want to spend that effort ? postdoc a : we make the effort . grad d : it 's kind of like signing up for a mailing list . they have opt in and opt out . and there are two different ways . i mean , and either way works probably , i mean . postdoc a : except i really think in this case i i 'm agr i agree with liz , that we need to be in the clear and not have to after the fact say `` oh , but i assumed `` , and `` oh , i 'm sorry that your email address was just accumulating mail without notifying you `` , you know . professor b : if this is a purely administrative task , we can actually have administration do it . postdoc a : oh , excellent . professor b : but the thing is that , you know , i i i think , without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers , from my previous conversations with them , my my sense very much is that we would want something on record as indicating that they actually were aware of this . grad f : well , we had talked about this before professor b : mm - hmm . grad f : and i thought that we had even gone by the lawyers asking about that and they said you have to s they 've already signed away the f with that form that they 've already signed once . postdoc a : i do n't remember that this issue of the time period allowed for response was ever covered . grad f : yeah . professor b : yeah . we never really talked about that . phd e : or the date at which they would be receiving the email from you . postdoc a : or or how they would indicate professor b : yeah . phd e : they probably forgot all about it . professor b : we certainly did n't talk , uh , about with them at all about , uh , the manner of them being made the , uh , uh , materials available . phd e : yeah . phd h : we do it like with these professor b : that was something that was sort of just within our implementation . phd h : we can use it we can use a a ploy like they use to , um you know , that when they serve , like uh , uh , uh { comment } uh , you know , like dead - beat dads , they they they make it look like they won something in the lottery and then they open the envelope grad d : and they 're served . phd h : and that right ? because and then the the the the thing is served . so you just make it , you know , `` oh , you won you know , go to this web site and you 've , uh you 're `` phd e : that 's why you never open these things that come in the mail . postdoc a : that one . professor b : yeah . grad f : well , it 's just , we 've gone from one extreme to the other , where at one point , a few months ago , morgan was you were saying let 's not do anything , phd h : right . right . no , it i it might postdoc a : well , it does n't matter . phd h : i i it it might well be the case grad f : and now we 're we 're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature ? phd h : it might right . grad f : i mean , what are we gon na doing here ? phd h : it might well be the case that that this is perfectly you know , this is enough to give us a basis t to just , eh , assume their consent if they do n't reply . professor b : well . grad f : mm - hmm . phd h : but , i 'm not you know , me not being a lawyer , i would n't just wan na do that without having the the expert , uh , opinion on that . postdoc a : and how many people ? al - altogether we 've got twenty people . these people are people who read their email almost all the time . grad f : then i think we had better find out , so that we can find a phd h : yeah . professor b : let me look at this again . grad f : right . postdoc a : i i really do n't see that it 's a problem . i i think that it 's a common courtesy to ask them uh , to expect for them to , uh , be able to have @ @ { comment } us try to contact them , grad f : for for th postdoc a : u just in case they had n't gotten their email . i think they 'd appreciate it . professor b : yeah . my adam , my my view before was about the nature of what was of the presentation , grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : of of how my my the things that we 're questioning were along the lines of how easy uh , h how m how much implication would there be that it 's likely you 're going to be changing something , as opposed to grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : that was the kind of dispute i was making before . postdoc a : mm - hmm . i remember that . professor b : but , um , the attorneys , i uh , i can guarantee you , the attorneys will always come back with and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things , but they will always come back with saying that , um , you need to you want to have someth some paper trail or which includes electronic trail that they have , uh , in fact o k 'd it . grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : so , um , i think that if you f i if we send the email as you have and if there 's half the people , say , who do n't respond at all by , you know , some period of time , we can just make a list of these people and hand it to , uh you know , just give it to me and i 'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever , grad f : right . professor b : and they 'll just call them up and say , you know , `` have you is is this ok ? and would you please mail you know , mail adam that it is , if i if it , you know , is or not . `` so , you know , we can we can do that . phd e : the other thing that there 's a psychological effect that at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying `` yes , i will do it `` or `` yes , i got your email `` , they 're more likely to actually do it { comment } later than to just ignore it . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : and of course we do n't want them to bleep things out , but it it 's a little bit better if we 're getting the their , uh , final response , once they 've answered you once than if they never answer you 'd { comment } at al at all . that 's how these mailing houses work . so , i mean , it 's not completely lost work because it might benefit us in terms of getting responses . postdoc a : mm - hmm . phd e : you know , an official ok from somebody is better than no answer , even if they responded that they got your email . and they 're probably more likely to do that once they 've responded that they got the email . postdoc a : i also think they 'd just simply appreciate it . i think it 's a good a good way of of fostering goodwill among our subjects . well , our participants . professor b : i think the main thing is i mean , what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases . grad f : sending lots of spam . professor b : so they s so so tha - that 's what they 're paid to do . and so , it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something and they would n't actually hear from us , and then they find this thing is in there and we 've already distributed it to someone . so , what it says in there , in fact , is that they will be given an opportunity to blah - blah - blah , postdoc a : mm - hmm . professor b : but if in fact if we sent them something or we thought we sent them something but they did n't actually receive it for some reason , um , then we have n't given them that . grad f : well , so how far do we have to go ? do we need to get someone 's signature ? or , is email enough ? professor b : i i i em email is enough . grad f : do we have to have it notarized ? i mean ok . professor b : yeah . i mean , i 've been through this i mean , i 'm not a lawyer , but i 've been through these things a f things f like this a few times with lawyers now grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : so i i i i 'm pretty comfortable with that . phd c : do you track , um , when people log in to look at the ? grad f : uh . if they submit the form , i get it . phd c : uh - huh . grad f : if they do n't submit the form , it goes in the general web log . but that 's not sufficient . right ? cuz if someone just visits the web site that does n't imply anything in particular . phd c : except that you know they got the mail . postdoc a : mm - hmm . that 's right . grad f : right . postdoc a : i i could get you on the notify list if you want me to . grad f : i 'm already on it . postdoc a : for that directory ? ok , great . grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : so again , hopefully , um , this should n't be quite as odious a problem either way , uh , in any of the extremes we 've talked about because uh , we 're talking a pretty small number of people . grad f : w for this set , i 'm not worried , because we basically know everyone on it . professor b : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad f : you know , they 're all more or less here or it 's it 's eric and dan and so on . but for some of the others , you 're talking about visitors who are gone from icsi , whose email addresses may or may not work , professor b : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad f : and so what are we gon na do when we run into someone that we ca n't get in touch with ? postdoc a : i do n't think , uh they 're so recent , these visitors . grad f : mm - hmm . postdoc a : i and and i they 're also so professor b : mm - hmm . postdoc a : they 're prominent enough that they 're easy to find through i i mean , i i w i 'll be able to if you have any trouble finding them , i really think i could find them . grad f : other methods ? ok . professor b : yeah . cuz it what it what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission . um , and i think , you know , if you go into a room and close the door and and ask their permission and they 're not there , it does n't seem { comment } that that 's the intent of , uh , meaning here . so . grad f : well , the qu the question is just whether how active it has to be . i mean , because they they filled out a contact information and that 's where i 'm sending the information . professor b : right . grad f : and so far everyone has done email . there is n't anyone who did , uh , any other contact method . professor b : well , the way icsi goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc have forwards to other accounts and so on . grad f : yeah . professor b : so it 's unusual that that they , uh grad f : so my original impression was that that was sufficient , that if they give us contact information and that contact information is n't accurate that we fulfilled our burden . professor b : yeah . phd e : then they just come back . phd c : all my files were still here . phd e : same as us . postdoc a : i just professor b : so if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe i will call the attorney about it . phd c : yeah . professor b : but , you know , hopefully we wo n't need to . postdoc a : i d i just do n't think we will . for all the reasons that we 've discussed . grad f : alright . professor b : so we 'll we 'll see if we do or not . grad f : yep . and we 'll see how many people respond to that email . postdoc a : yeah . grad f : so far , two people have . professor b : yeah . i think very few people will and and and , you know , people people see long emails about things that they do n't think is gon na be high priority , they typically , uh , do n't do n't read it , or half read it . grad f : right . professor b : cuz people are swamped . postdoc a : and actually , professor b : but postdoc a : um , i i did n't anticipate this so i that 's why i did n't give this comment , and it i this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow - up email within the next couple of days saying `` by the way , you know , we wan na hear back from you by x date and please `` , and then add what liz said `` please , uh , respond to please indicate you received this mail . `` professor b : uh , or e well , maybe even additionally , uh , um , `` even if you 've decided you have no changes you 'd like to make , if you could tell us that `` . grad f : respond to the email . { comment } yep . postdoc a : mm - hmm . it is the first time through the cycle . professor b : yeah . phd e : right . that would that would definitely work on me . you know , it makes you feel m like , um , if you were gon na p if you 're predicting that you might not answer , you have a chance now to say that . whereas , i i mean , i would be much more likely myself , phd c : and the other th phd e : given all my email , t to respond at that point , saying `` you know what , i 'm probably not gon na get to it `` or whatever , rather than just having seen the email , thinking i might get to it , and never really , uh , pushing myself to actually do it until it 's too late . phd c : yeah . i was i was thinking that it also lets them know that they do n't have to go to the page to accept this . phd e : right . r right . that 's true . professor b : right . phd c : i mean , i i yeah . so that way they could they can see from that email that if they just write back and say `` i got it , no changes `` , they 're off the hook . professor b : yeah . phd c : they do n't have to go to the web page professor b : i mean , the other thing i 've learned from dealing with dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth , uh , is , um , if you say `` you 've got three months to do this review `` , um , people do it , you know , two and seven eighths months from now . phd c : and phd e : yeah . that 's true . professor b : if you say `` you 've got three weeks to do this review `` , they do do it , you know , two and seven eighths weeks from now they do the review . grad f : right . professor b : and , um so , if we make it a little less time , i do n't think it 'll be that much grad f : well , and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth , that means we better give them deadline of the first , if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time . professor b : there 's the responding part and there 's also what if , uh , i mean , i hope this does n't happen , what if there are a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes ? grad f : right . professor b : then we actually have to deal with that postdoc a : mm - hmm . some lead time . professor b : if we want it to grad f : ugh ! disk space , postdoc a : by the way , has has jeremy signed the form ? grad f : oh my god ! i had n't thought about that . that for every meeting any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of . phd c : just that channel . grad d : ca n't you just do that channel ? phd c : oh , no . we have to do grad f : no , of course not . phd e : yeah . you have to do all of them , grad f : you need all the channels . phd c : do you have to do the other close - talking ? phd e : as well as all of these . grad d : yeah . phd e : you have to do all you could just do it in that time period , though , grad f : yes . absolutely . there 's a lot of cross - talk . postdoc a : well phd e : but i guess it 's a pain . grad f : well , but you have to copy the whole file . phd e : yeah . grad f : right ? because we 're gon na be releasing the whole file . phd e : yeah . you 're right . postdoc a : well i you know , i think at a certain point , that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy . grad f : yeah . it 's just i hate deleting any data . so i i do n't want i really would rather make a copy of it , rather than bleep it out professor b : are you del are you bleeping it by adding ? grad f : and then overlapping . so , it 's it 's exactly a censor bleep . so what i really think is `` bleep `` professor b : i i i i understand , but is is it summing signals grad f : and then i want to professor b : or do you delete the old one and put the new one in ? grad f : i delete the old one , put the new one in . professor b : oh , ok . cuz grad f : there 's nothing left of the original signal . professor b : oh . cuz if you were summing , you could no . but anyway grad f : yeah . it would be qui quite easy to get it back again . postdoc a : but and then w i was gon na say also that the they do n't have to stay on the system , as you know , professor b : yeah . phd e : then someday we can sell the unedited versions . postdoc a : cuz cuz the the ones grad f : say again ? postdoc a : once it 's been successfully bleeped , ca n't you rely on the ? phd c : or we 'll tell people the frequency of the beep professor b : encrypt it . phd c : and then they could subtract the beep out . grad d : you can hide it . yeah . postdoc a : ca n't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version ? phd h : oh , yeah . grad d : it would n't be that hard to hide it . phd e : right . exactly . i see . grad f : yeah , that 's true . yeah . yep , that 's true . phd e : see , this is good . i wanted to create some side conversations in these meetings . professor b : yeah . you could encrypt it , you know , with a with a two hundred bit thousand bit , uh grad d : you can use spread spectrum . phd c : uh - huh . grad d : hide it . phd e : so phd c : here we go . phd e : yeah . yeah . grad d : yeah , there you go . phd e : cuz we do n't have enough asides . phd h : i have an idea . you reverse the signal , grad d : there you go . phd h : so it it lets people say what they said backwards . grad f : backwards . grad d : then you have , like , subliminal , uh , messages , grad f : but , ha you 've seen the this the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments . phd h : yeah . grad d : like . grad f : did you read that paper ? it would n't work . the speech recognizer still works . phd e : yeah . and if you do it backward then professor b : yeah . phd c : that 's cuz they use forward - backward . phd e : h - good old hmm . grad f : forward but backward . that 's right . phd e : no , it 's backward - forward . grad f : good point . a point . well , i 'm sorry if i sound a little peeved about this whole thing . it 's just we 've had meeting after meeting after meeting a on this and it seems like we 've never gotten it resolved . professor b : well , but we never also we 've also never done it . postdoc a : this is the first cycle . phd e : if it makes grad f : yeah . postdoc a : there 're bound to be some glitches the first time through . professor b : so . and , uh and i 'm sorry responding without , uh , having much knowledge , but the thing is , uh , i am , like , one of these people who gets a gazillion mails and and stuff comes in as grad f : well , and that 's exactly why i did it the way i did it , which is the default is if you do nothing we 're gon na release it . professor b : yeah . grad f : because , you know , i have my stack of emails of to d to be done , that , you know , fifty or sixty long , and the ones at the top i 'm never gon na get to . professor b : right . grad f : and , uh so so phd c : move them to the bottom . professor b : so so the only thing we 're missing is is some way to respond to easily to say , uh , `` ok , go ahead `` or something . grad f : yeah , right . so , i this is gon na mean phd c : just re - mail them to yourself and then they 're at the bottom . professor b : yeah . grad f : yeah . postdoc a : yeah . grad f : yeah . that 's actually definitely a good point . the m email does n't specify that you can just reply to the email , as op as opposed to going to the form postdoc a : mm - hmm . phd h : in postdoc a : and it also does n't give a a specific i did n't think of it . phd e : right . grad f : and postdoc a : s i think it 's a good idea an ex explicit time by which this will be considered definite . grad f : yeah , release . postdoc a : and and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint . professor b : yeah . it 's converging . postdoc a : yeah . that 's right . phd h : this um , i 've seen this recently . uh , i got email , and it i if i use a mime - capable mail reader , it actually says , you know , click on this button to confirm receipt of the of the mail . postdoc a : oh , that 's interesting . phd h : so grad f : you you can grad d : it 's like certified mail . grad f : a lot of mailers support return receipt . postdoc a : could do that . phd h : right . grad f : but it does n't confirm that they 've read it . phd h : no , no , no . this is different . this is not so , i i know , you can tell , you know , the , uh , mail delivery agent to to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox . grad f : right . phd h : but but , no . this was different . ins - in the mail , there was a grad f : oh , just a button . phd h : uh , th there was a button that when you clicked on it , it would send , uh , you know , a actual acknowledgement to the sender that you had actually looked at the mail . grad f : oh , yeah . yeah . unfor - yeah , we could do that . but i hate that . phd h : but it o but it only works for , you know , mime - capable you know , if you use netscape or something like that for your n grad f : yeah . professor b : and phd e : you might as well just respond to the mail . professor b : and we actually need a third thing . phd e : i mean phd h : right . professor b : it 's not that you 've looked at it , it 's that you 've looked at it and and and agree with one of the possible actions . phd h : no , no . you can do that . professor b : right ? phd h : you know , you can put this button anywhere you want , professor b : oh ? oh , i see . phd h : and you can put it the bottom of the message and say `` here , by you know , by clicking on this , i i agree uh , you know , i acknowledge `` professor b : that i i my first - born children are yours , and yeah . yeah . phd e : quick question . are , um grad f : well , i could put a url in there without any difficulty and even pretty simple mime readers can do that . so . postdoc a : but why should n't they just email back ? i do n't see there 's a problem . professor b : yeah . grad f : yeah . reply . phd h : right . postdoc a : it 's very nice . i i like the high - tech aspect of it , professor b : yeah . postdoc a : but i think phd h : no , no , no . i actually do n't . postdoc a : i appreciate it . phd h : i 'm just saying that grad f : well , i cuz i use a text mail reader . phd h : if ev but i 'm phd e : do n't you use vi for your mai ? phd h : yeah . professor b : wow . that 's that 's my guy . alright . grad f : you you read email in vi ? phd h : yeah . postdoc a : yeah . i like vi . phd h : so i i there 's these logos that you can put at the bottom of your web page , like `` powered by vi `` . grad d : yeah . i see . phd e : anyway , quick question . grad f : you could put wed bugs in the email . phd h : yeah . phd e : like , there were three meetings this time , or so or how many ? six ? but , no of different people . so i guess if you 're in both these types of meetings , you 'd have a lot . but how i mean , it also depends on how many like , if we release this time it 's a fairly small number of meetings , but what if we release , like , twenty - five meetings to people ? in th grad f : well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails every time a meeting has been checked and is ready . phd e : i do n't know . oh . oh , ok . so this time was just the first chunk . ok . grad f : so . tha - that was my intention . it 's just yeah that we just happened to have a bunch all at once . phd e : well , that 's a good idea . grad f : i mean , maybe is that the way it 's gon na be , you think , jane ? postdoc a : i agree with you . it 's we could do it , uh i i could i 'd be happy with either way , batch - wise what i was thinking uh , so this one that was exactly right , that we had a uh , uh i i had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready . do n't have it . but , uh , this was the biggest clump i could do by a time where i thought it was reasonable . professor b : mm - hmm . postdoc a : people would be able to check it and still have it ready by then . my , um i was thinking that with the nsa meetings , i 'd like there are three of them , and they 're uh , i i will have them done by monday . uh , unfortunately the time is later and i do n't know how that 's gon na work out , but i thought it 'd be good to have that released as a clump , too , because then , you know , they 're they they have a it it 's in a category , it 's not quite so distracting to them , is what i was thinking , and it 's all in one chu but after that , when we 're caught up a bit on this process , then , um , i could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available . i could do it either way . i mean , it 's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking . professor b : we heard anything from ibm ? at all ? phd c : uh . let 's see . we yeah , right . so we got the transcript back from that one meeting . everything seemed fine . adam had a script that will put everything back together and there was well , there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix . and then , um , we , uh i sent him a pointer to three more . and so he 's off and working on those . grad f : yeah . now we have n't actually had anyone go through that meeting , to see whether the transcript is correct and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff . postdoc a : that 's on my list . grad f : so at some point we need to do that . phd c : yeah . postdoc a : well , that 's on my list . phd c : yeah . it 's gon na have to go through our regular process . grad f : i mean , the one thing i noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels . there are a fair number of `` yeahs `` and `` uh - huhs `` that it 's just that are n't in there . so . professor b : but i think yeah . like you said , i mean , that 's that 's gon na be our standard proc that 's what the transcribers are gon na be spending most of their time doing , i would imagine , postdoc a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . professor b : once once we grad f : yes , absolutely . yeah . postdoc a : one question about the backchannels . professor b : it 's gon na postdoc a : do you suppose that was because they were n't caught by the pre - segmenter ? grad f : yes , absolutely . absolutely . postdoc a : oh , interesting . oh , interesting . ok . grad f : yeah . they 're they 're not in the segmented . it 's not that the ibm people did n't do it . just they did n't get marked . postdoc a : ok . so maybe when the detector for that gets better or something i w i there 's another issue which is this we 've been , uh , contacted by university of washington now , of course , to , um we sent them the transcripts that correspond to those six meetings and they 're downloading the audio files . so they 'll be doing that . chuck 's chuck 's , uh , put that in . phd c : mm - hmm . yeah , i pointed them to the set that andreas put , uh , on the web so th if they want to compare directly with his results they can . and , um , then once , uh , th we can also point them at the , um , uh , the original meetings and they can grab those , too , with scp . phd e : wait . so you put the reference files ? phd c : no , no . they d they wanted the audio . phd e : or the ? phd c : jane sent them the , uh , transcripts . phd e : no , i mean of the transcripts . um . well , we can talk about it off - line . phd c : mm - hmm . grad f : there 's another meeting in here , what , at four ? right ? yeah , so we have to finish by three forty - five . phd h : d d so , does washi - does does uw wan na u do this wan na use this data for recognition or for something else ? phd c : uh , for recognition . phd e : i think they 're doing w did n't they want to do language modeling on , you know , recognition - compatible transcripts phd h : oh . i see . postdoc a : this is to show you , uh , some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure . professor b : yeah . phd e : or ? postdoc a : um @ @ { comment } so , this is from one of the nsa meetings and , uh , i if you 're familiar with the diff format , the arrow to the left is what it was , and the arrow to the right is what it was changed to . so , um . and now the first one . `` ok . so , then we started a weekly meeting . the last time , uh `` and the transcriber thought `` little too much `` but , uh , really , um , it was `` we learned too much `` , which makes more sense syntactically as well . phd h : and these the parentheses were f from postdoc a : then oh , this that 's the convention for indicating uncertain . grad f : u uncertains . postdoc a : so the transcriber was right . you know , she was uncertain about that . so she 's right to be uncertain . and it 's also a g a good indication of the of that . phd h : oh . { comment } ok . postdoc a : the next one . this was about , uh , claudia and she 'd been really b busy with stuff , such as waivers . uh , ok . um , next one . um . this was an interesting one . so the original was `` so that 's not so claudia 's not the bad master here `` , and then he laughs , but it really `` web master `` . grad f : web master . grad d : oh . { comment } uh - oh . postdoc a : and then you see another type of uncertainty which is , you know , they just did n't know what to make out of that . so instead of `` split upon unknown `` , { comment } it 's `` split in principle `` . grad d : jane , these are from ibm ? grad f : spit upon ? grad d : the top lines ? postdoc a : no , no . these are these are our local transcriptions of the nsa meetings . grad f : no , these are ours . postdoc a : the transcribers transcriber 's version ver versus the checked version . grad d : oh . oh , i see . postdoc a : my my checked version , after i go through it . um , then you get down here . um . sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms . that 's the next example , the next one . the , uh , version beyond this is so instead of saying `` or `` , especially those words , `` also `` and `` oder `` and some other ones . those sneak in . um , the next one grad f : that 's cool . phd h : discourse markers . discourse markers . postdoc a : sorry , what ? discourse markers ? sure . sure , sure , sure . phd h : discourse markers . postdoc a : and it 's and it makes sense phd h : yeah . yeah . postdoc a : cuz it 's , like , below this it 's a little subliminal there . phd h : yeah . yeah , yeah . postdoc a : um . ok , the next one , uh , this is a term . the problem with terminology . description with th the transcriber has `` x as an advance `` . but really it 's `` qs in advance `` . i mean , i i 've benefited from some of these , uh , cross - group meetings . ok , then you got , um , uh , instead of `` from something - or - other cards `` , { comment } it 's `` for multicast `` . and instead of `` ann system related `` , it 's `` end system related `` . this was changed to an acronym initially and it should should n't have been . and then , you can see here `` gps `` was misinterpreted . it 's just totally understanda this is this is a lot of jargon . um , and the final one , the transcriber had th `` in the core network itself or the exit unknown , not the internet unknown `` . and it it comes through as `` in the core network itself of the access provider , not the internet backbone core `` . now this is a lot of terminology . and they 're generally extremely good , but , you know in this this area it really does pay to , um to double check and i 'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you 'll see s substantial improvements in performance cuz the you know , there 're a lot of these in there . phd h : yeah . so how often ? grad f : yeah , but i bet i bet they 're acoustically challenging parts anyway , though . postdoc a : no , actually no . huh - uh . grad f : oh , really ? uh , it 's oh , so it 's just jargon . postdoc a : it 's jargon . yeah . i mean this is cuz , you know you do n't realize in daily life how much you have top - down influences in what you 're hearing . phd h : well , but postdoc a : and it 's jar it 's jargon coupled with a foreign accent . phd h : but but but we do n't i mean , our language model right now does n't know about these words anyhow . so , professor b : yeah . phd h : you know , un until you actually get a decent language model , @ @ { comment } adam 's right . grad f : it probably wo n't do any better . phd h : you probably wo n't notice a difference . but it 's i mean , it 's definitely good that these are fixed . i mean , obviously . postdoc a : well , also from the standpoint of getting people 's approval , professor b : yeah . postdoc a : cuz if someone sees a page full of uh , um , barely decipherable w you know , sentences , and then is asked to approve of it or not , it 's , uh , uh grad f : did i say that ? professor b : yeah . yeah . that would be a shame if people said `` well , i do n't approve it because the it 's not what i said `` . grad f : well , that 's exactly why i put the extra option in , professor b : yeah . postdoc a : exactly . that 's why we discussed that . professor b : yeah . grad f : is that i was afraid people would say , `` let 's censor that because it 's wrong `` , professor b : yeah . grad f : and i do n't want them to do that . postdoc a : and then i also the final thing i have for transcription is that i made a purchase of some other headphones because of the problem of low gain in the originals . and and they very much appro they mu much prefer the new ones , and actually i i mean , i i think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the the choice . we 'd originally chosen , uh , very expensive head headsets grad f : yeah . ugh ! postdoc a : but , um , they 're just not as good as these , um , in this with this respect to this particular task . phd h : well , return the old ones . grad f : it 's probably impedance matching problems . postdoc a : i do n't know exactly , grad f : but postdoc a : but we chose them because that 's what 's been used here by prominent projects in transcription . professor b : could be . postdoc a : so it i we had every reason to think they would work . grad f : mm - hmm . phd h : so you have spare headsets ? postdoc a : sorry , what ? phd h : you have spare headsets ? grad f : they 're just earphones . they 're not headsets . they 're not microphones . phd e : right . phd h : no , no . i mean , just earphones ? um , because i , uh , i could use one on my workstation , just to t because sometimes i have to listen to audio files and i do n't have to b go borrow it from someone and postdoc a : we have actua actually i have w well , the thing is , that if we have four people come to work for a day , i was i was hanging on to the others for , eh for spares , phd h : oh , ok . postdoc a : but i can tell you what i recommend . professor b : no , but you 'd if you yeah , w we should get it . phd h : sure . no problem . grad f : but if you need it , just get it . phd h : i just grad f : come on . phd h : right . professor b : yeah . if you need it . phd h : yeah . professor b : yeah . postdoc a : it 'd just have to be a s a separate order an added order . grad d : yeah , i still i still need to get a pair , too . professor b : they 're they 're they 're they 're pretty inexpensive . phd e : yeah , that we should order a cou uh , t two or three or four , actually . professor b : yeah . grad d : i 'm using one of these . yeah . phd e : we have phd h : i think i have a pair that i brought from home , but it 's f just for music listening professor b : no . just just just just buy them . phd e : sh - just get the model number phd h : and it 's not nnn . yeah . professor b : just buy them . phd e : and where do you buy these from ? phd h : yeah . postdoc a : cambridge soundworks , just down the street . phd e : like ? you just b go and b postdoc a : yeah . they always have them in stock . professor b : yeah . phd e : that 'd be a good idea . phd h : anyway . professor b : yeah . grad f : w uh , could you email out the brand ? postdoc a : oh , sure . yeah . ok . grad f : cuz i think sounds like people are interested . grad d : yeah . professor b : yeah . grad d : definitely . postdoc a : it 's made a difference in in how easy . yeah . professor b : i realized something i should talk about . so what 's the other thing on the agenda actually ? grad f : uh , the only one was don wanted to , uh , talk about disk space yet again . grad d : yeah . u it 's short . i mean , if you wan na go , we can just throw it in at the end . professor b : no , no . why do n't you why do n't you go ahead since it 's short . grad d : um , well , uh . grad f : oh , i thought you meant the disk space . yeah , we know disk space is short . phd h : the disk space was short . yeah . that 's what i thought too . phd e : that 's a great ambiguity . professor b : yeah . phd e : it 's one of these it 's it 's social professor b : it 's i i i it i phd e : and , uh , discourse level grad d : yeah . phd e : and professor b : yeah , it 's great . yeah , phd e : sorry . professor b : double double grad f : yeah , it was really goo phd e : see , if i had that little scratch - pad , i would have made an x there . grad d : thank you , thank you . grad f : uh , well , we 'll give you one then . professor b : yeah . grad d : um . so , um , without thinking about it , when i offered up my hard drive last week grad f : oh , no . grad d : um , this is always a suspect phrase . phd e : it was while i was out of town . grad d : but , um , no . i , uh i realized that we 're going to be doing a lot of experiments , um , o for this , uh , paper we 're writing , so we 're probably gon na need a lot more we 're probably gon na need that disk space that we had on that eighteen gig hard drive . but , um , we also have someone else coming in that 's gon na help us out with some stuff . professor b : we 've just ordered a hundred gigabytes . grad d : so ok . we just need to phd e : i think we need , like , another eighteen gig disk to be safe . professor b : well , we 're getting three thirty thirty - sixes . right ? that are going into the main f file server . phd c : markham 's ordering and they should be coming in soon . grad d : w well . so so grad f : soon ? grad d : yeah . i mean , i guess the thing is is , all i need is to hang it off , like , the person who 's coming in , sonali 's , computer . phd h : oh , so so , you mean the d the internal the disks on the machines that we just got ? grad d : whew . or we can move them . phd c : these are gon na go onto abbott . grad f : ne - new disks . phd h : or extra disk ? professor b : onto abbott , the file server . grad d : so are we gon na move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in ? grad f : on phd h : oh , oh . ok . grad f : yeah . phd e : uh , i grad f : once they come in . sure . grad d : ok . that 's fine . phd e : do when when is this planned for roughly ? phd c : they should be i i imagine next week or something . phd e : ok . so grad f : if you 're if you 're desperate , i have some space on my drive . grad d : i think if i 'm grad f : but i i vacillate between no space free and a few gig free . grad d : yeah . i think i can find something if i 'm desperate phd e : yeah . grad d : and , um , in the meantime i 'll just hold out . that was the only thing i wanted to bring up . phd c : it should be soon . we we should professor b : so there 's another hundred gig . so . grad d : alright . great . phd h : mm - hmm . professor b : ok . it 's great to be able to do it , grad d : that 's it . professor b : just say `` oh yeah , a hundred gig , phd e : good . professor b : no big deal `` . grad d : yeah . grad f : yeah . a hundred gig here , a hundred gig there . phd e : well , each meeting is like a gig or something , grad f : it 's eventually real disk space . professor b : yeah . phd e : so it 's really professor b : yeah . um . yeah . i was just going to comment that i i 'm going to , uh , be on the phone with mari tomorrow , late afternoon . grad f : oh , yeah . professor b : we 're supposed to get together and talk about , uh , where we are on things . uh , there 's this meeting coming up , uh , and there 's also an annual report . now , i never actually i i was asking about this . i do n't really quite understand this . she was re she was referring to it as i think this actually did n't just come from her , but this is what , uh , darpa had asked for . um , she 's referring to it as the an annual report for the fiscal year . but of course the fiscal year starts in october , so i do n't quite understand w w why we do an annual report that we 're writing in july . phd c : she 's either really late or really early . grad f : huh . or she 's getting a good early start . professor b : uh , i think basically it it 's none of those . it 's that the meeting is in july so they so darpa just said do an annual report . so . so . so anyway , i 'll be putting together stuff . i 'll do it , uh , you know , as much as i can without bothering people , just by looking at at papers and status reports . i mean , the status reports you do are very helpful . uh , so i can grab stuff there . and if , uh if i have some questions i 'll grad f : when we remember to fill them out . professor b : yeah . if people could do it as soon as as you can , if you have n't done one si recently . uh . uh , but , you know , i 'm i 'm sure before it 's all done , i 'll end up bugging people for for more clarification about stuff . um . but , um , i do n't know , i guess i guess i know pretty much what people have been doing . we have these meetings and and there 's the status reports . uh . but , um . um . yeah . so that was n't a long one . just to tell you that . and if something has n't , uh i 'll be talking to her late tomorrow afternoon , and if something has n't been in a status report and you think it 's important thing to mention on this kind of thing , uh , uh , just pop me a one - liner and and and i 'll i 'll have it in front of me for the phone conversation . uh . i guess , uh , you you 're still pecking away at the demos and all that , probably . grad f : yep . and don is gon na be helping out with that . professor b : oh , that 's right . grad f : did you wan na talk about that this afternoon ? not here , but later today ? grad d : we should probably talk off - line about when we 're gon na talk off - line . grad f : ok . ok . professor b : ok . yeah , i might want to get updated about it in about a week cuz , um , i 'm actually gon na have a a few days off the following week , a after the after the picnic . so . grad f : oh , ok . professor b : that 's all i had . grad f : so we were gon na do sort of status of speech transcription automatic transcription , but we 're kind of running late . so . phd e : how long does it take you to save the data ? grad f : fifteen minutes . phd e : yeah . grad f : so . if you wan na do a quick phd e : yeah . grad f : ten minute phd e : guess we should stop , like , twenty of at the latest . professor b : uh phd e : we we have another meeting coming in that they wan na record . professor b : and there 's the digits to do . so maybe may maybe maybe grad f : yeah . well , we can skip the digits . professor b : we could . fi - five minute report or something . phd e : it 's up to you . i do n't professor b : yeah , yeah . grad f : whatever you want . professor b : well , i would love to hear about it , grad f : what do you have to say ? professor b : especially since grad f : i 'm interested , so professor b : yeah . well , i 'm gon na be on the phone tomorrow , so this is just a good example of the sort of thing i 'd like to hear about . phd e : wait . why is everybody looking at me ? phd c : i do n't know . grad f : sorry . professor b : cuz he looked at you phd h : what ? professor b : and says you 're sketching . phd e : uh . i 'm not sure what you were referring to . phd h : i i i i 'm not actually , i 'm not sure what ? are we supposed to have done something ? grad f : no . we were just talking before about alternating the subject of the meeting . phd e : uh - huh . grad f : and this week we were gon na try to do t automatic transcription status . phd h : alternating . phd e : i was n't here last week . sorry . grad f : but we sort of failed . phd h : we did that last week . right ? professor b : i thought we did . grad f : did we ? ok . phd h : yeah . we did . grad f : ok . so now now we have the schedule . so next week we 'll do automatic transcription status , plus anything that 's real timely . phd e : oh . ok . professor b : ok . whew ! phd c : good update . grad f : whew ! professor b : that was grad f : dodged that bullet . professor b : yeah . nicely done , liz . postdoc a : a woman of few words . professor b : but but lots of prosody . ok . ok . phd h : uh , i mean , we we really have n't done anything . grad f : excuse me ? phd h : sorry . postdoc a : well , since last week . phd e : yeah , we 're phd h : i mean , the the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the , um the automatic alignments because , uh , i got some i i i learned from thilo what data we can use as a benchmark to see how well we 're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech or , of the foreground speech with background speech . grad f : yeah . phd e : and then , uh , i guess , the new data that don will start to process phd h : but , we have n't actually phd e : the , um when he can get these you know , before we were working with these segments that were all synchronous and that caused a lot of problems because you have timed sp at on either side . grad f : oh . right , right . mm - hmm . phd e : and so that 's sort of a stage - two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries with them is really the next step . grad f : right . postdoc a : i 'll be interested . phd e : we did get our , um i guess , good news . we got our abstract accepted for this conference , um workshop , isca workshop , in , um , uh , new jersey . and we sent in a very poor abstract , but they very poor , very quick . um , but we 're hoping to have a paper for that as well , which should be an interesting grad f : when 's it due ? phd e : the t paper is n't due until august . the abstracts were already due . so it 's that kind of workshop . grad f : mm - hmm . phd e : but , i mean , the good news is that that will have sort of the european experts in prosody sort of a different crowd , and i think we 're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far , so that should be interesting . postdoc a : what 's the name of the meeting ? phd e : uh , it 's isca workshop on prosody in speech recognition and understanding , or something like that phd h : it 's called prosody to grad f : mm - hmm . postdoc a : good . phd e : some generic uh , so it 's focused on using prosody in automatic systems and there 's a um , a web page for it . professor b : y you going to , uh , eurospeech ? yeah . grad f : i do n't have a paper phd h : yeah . grad f : but i 'd kinda like to go , if i could . is that alright ? professor b : we 'll discuss it . grad f : ok . i guess that 's `` no `` . professor b : my my my car my car needs a good wash , by the way . grad f : ok . well , that th hey , if that 's what it takes , that 's fine with me . i 'll pick up your dry - cleaning , too . should we do digits ? professor b : yeah . phd h : can i go next ? because i have to leave , actually . grad f : yep . go for it . hmm ! thanks . thank you  . \n\n[Requirement] The summary must be {word_count_type} {word_count} words long.", "raw_data": "phd c : adam , what is the mike that , uh , jeremy 's wearing ? grad f : it 's the ear - plug mike . postdoc a : ear - plug . phd e : that 's good . phd c : is that a wireless , or ? oh . grad g : it 's wired . postdoc a : is that does that mean you ca n't hear anything during the meeting ? grad d : it 's old - school . grad f : huh ? what ? huh ? professor b : should we , uh , close the door , maybe ? grad f : it it 's a fairly good mike , actually . professor b : so it 's yeah . huh . grad f : well , i should n't say it 's a good mike . all i really know is that the signal level is ok . i do n't know if it 's a the quality . professor b : well , that 's a grad f : ugh ! so i did n't send out agenda items because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item and now we have two . so . and , uh . professor b : ok . so , just to repeat the thing bef that we said last week , it was there 's this suggestion of alternating weeks on more , uh , automatic speech recognition related or not ? was that sort of the division ? grad f : right . professor b : so which week are we in ? grad f : well we have n't really started , but i thought we more we more or less did meeting recorder stuff last week , so i thought we could do , uh professor b : i thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week too . phd c : yeah . grad f : but i figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each . professor b : yeah . grad f : so . i seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted . here we go . so , uh , as most of you should know , i did send out the consent form thingies and , uh , so far no one has made any ach ! { comment } { comment } any comments on them . so , no on no one has bleeped out anything . professor b : um . yeah . grad f : so . i do n't expect anyone to . but . professor b : um . so , w what follows ? at some point y you go around and get people to sign something ? grad f : no . we had spoken w about this before professor b : yeah , but i 've forgotten . grad f : and we had decided that they have they only needed to sign once . and the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity . so as long as we do that , we 're covered . professor b : and how long of an opportunity did you tell them ? grad f : uh , july fifteenth . professor b : july fifteenth . oh , so they have a plenty of time , and y given that it 's that long , um , um why was that date chosen ? you just felt you wanted to ? grad f : jane told me july fifteenth . so , that 's what i set it . postdoc a : oh . i just meant that that was the release date that you had on the data . professor b : oh , ok . grad f : oh . i i did n't understand that there was something specific . postdoc a : i , uh i thought grad f : you y you had professor b : i do n't grad f : i had heard july fifteenth , so that 's what i put . postdoc a : mm - hmm . professor b : no , the only th the only mention i recall about that was just that july fifteenth or so is when this meeting starts . postdoc a : that 's right . that 's why . professor b : oh , i see . postdoc a : you said you wanted it to be available then . i did n't mean it to be the hard deadline . professor b : right . postdoc a : it 's fine with me if it is , or we cou but i thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that in case , uh you know , `` by the way this is your last `` professor b : right . postdoc a : uh . yeah . professor b : we probably should have talked about it , cuz i because if we wan na be able to give it to people july fifteenth , if somebody 's gon na come back and say `` ok , i do n't want this and this and this used `` , uh , clearly we need some time to respond to that . right ? grad f : yeah . as i said , we i just got one date professor b : yeah . phd h : damn ! grad f : and that 's the one i used . professor b : yeah . grad f : so . but i can send a follow - up . i mean , it 's almost all us . i mean the people who are in the meeti this meeting was , uh , these the meetings that in are in set one . phd c : was my was my response ok ? postdoc a : that 's right . phd c : i just wrote you replied to the email saying they 're all fine . grad f : right . i mean , that 's fine . phd c : ok , good . grad f : i we do n't my understanding of what we had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that , uh , we do n't actually need a reply . phd c : that makes it easy . grad f : we just need to tell them that they can do it if they want . professor b : ok . i just did n't remember , but grad f : and so no reply is no changes . postdoc a : and he 's got it so that the default thing you see when you look at the page is `` ok `` . so that 's very clear all the way down the page , `` ok `` . and they have two options they can change it to . one of them is `` censor `` , and the other one is `` incorrect `` . is it is your word is `` incorrect `` ? grad f : right . postdoc a : which means also we get feedback on if um , there 's something that they w that needs to be adjusted , because , i mean , these are very highly technical things . i mean , it 's an added , uh , level of checking on the accuracy of the transcription , as i see it . but in any case , people can agree to things that are wrong . grad f : well yeah . the reason i did that it was just so that people would not censor not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly , postdoc a : and the reason i liked it was because grad f : as opposed to , uh postdoc a : was because it , um it gives them the option of , uh , being able to correct it . grad f : right . postdoc a : approve it and correct it . and um . so , you have it nicely set up so they email you and , uh grad f : when they submit the form , it gets processed and emailed to me . postdoc a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . and i wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are robustness and meeting recorder . the german ones will be ready for next week . those are three three of those . a different set of people . and we can impose phd c : the german ones ? postdoc a : uh , well . phd h : yeah . those uh postdoc a : ok . i spoke loosely . the the german , french sorry , the german , dutch , and spanish ones . phd e : spanish . yeah . grad f : mm - hmm . phd c : oh , those are the nsa meetings ? phd e : the non - native phd h : those are postdoc a : yeah . uh - huh . professor b : german , dutch , swiss and spanish . phd c : oh , oh ! ok . phd e : the all non - native postdoc a : that 's that 's that 's r grad f : mm - hmm . phd h : uh - huh . phd c : ok . i 'd i d postdoc a : yeah . it 's the other group . professor b : i it was the network network services group . postdoc a : uh - huh . yeah , exactly . yeah . professor b : yeah . postdoc a : i did n't mean to isolate them . professor b : otherwise known as the german , dutch , and spanish . postdoc a : yeah . sorry . it was it was not the best characterization . grad f : mm - hmm . postdoc a : but what what i meant to say was that it 's the other group that 's not n no m no overlap with our present members . and then maybe it 'd be good to set an explicit deadline , something like a week before that , uh , j july fifteenth date , or two weeks before . professor b : i mean , i would suggest we discuss i mean , if we 're going to have a policy on it , that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people , grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : so that we have a uniform thing . so , tha that 's a month , which is fine . i mean , it seems phd c : twelve hours . grad f : well , the only thing i said in the email is that the data is going to be released on the fifteenth . i did n't give any other deadline . postdoc a : mm - hmm . grad f : so my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says , `` wow i suddenly found something `` , we 'll delete it from our record . we just wo n't delete it from whatever 's already been released . postdoc a : hmm . that 's a little bit difficult . grad f : what else can we do ? postdoc a : yeah . grad f : if someone says `` hey , look , i found something in this meeting and it 's libelous and i want it removed `` . what can we do ? postdoc a : well . that 's true . grad f : we have to remove it . postdoc a : i i agree with that part , but i think that it would it , uh we need to have , uh , a a a message to them very clearly that beyond this date , you ca n't make additional changes . professor b : i mean , um , i i i i think that somebody might request something even though we say that . but i think it 's good to at least start some place like that . postdoc a : mm - hmm . good . professor b : so if we agreed , ok , how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have if we say two weeks , or if we say a month , i think we should just say that say that , you know , i a as um , `` per the the the , uh , page you signed , you have the ability to look over this stuff `` and so forth `` and , uh , because we w `` these , uh i would i would imagine some sort of generic thing that would say `` because we , uh , will continually be making these things available to other researchers , uh , this ca n't be open - ended and so , uh , uh , please give us back your response within this am you know , within this amount of time `` , whatever time we agree upon . grad f : well , did you read the email and look at the pages i sent ? professor b : did i ? no , i have n't yet . no , just grad f : no . ok , well why do n't you do that and then make comments on what you want me to change ? professor b : no , no . i 'm not saying that you should change anything . i i 'm what i 'm what i 'm i 'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully among people who have read it so that that you can you can , uh , decide on something . postdoc a : mm - hmm . professor b : so i 'm not telling you what to decide . postdoc a : mm - hmm . professor b : i 'm just saying you should decide something , and then grad f : i already did decide something , and that 's what 's in the email . postdoc a : yeah , yeah . ok , so grad f : and if you disagree with it , why do n't you read it and give me comments on it ? postdoc a : yeah . well i i think that there 's one missing line . professor b : well , the one thing that i did read and that you just repeated to me was that you gave the specific date of july fifteenth . grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : and you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you . so what i 'm telling you is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough grad f : right . professor b : and you should use that rather than this date that you just got from somewhere . that 's all i 'm saying . postdoc a : i ha i have one question . this is in the summer period and presumably people may be out of town . but we can make the assumption , ca n't we ? that , um , they will be receiving email , uh , most of the month . right ? because if someone professor b : it well , it well , you 're right . sometimes somebody will be away and , uh , you know , there 's , uh for any length of time that you uh , choose there is some person sometime who will not end up reading it . that 's it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take . phd h : s so maybe when am i on , by the way ? grad f : i do n't know . you should be . phd h : oh . hello ? hello ? grad f : you should be channel b . phd h : oh , ok . alright . so . the , um maybe we should say in w you know , when the whole thing starts , when they sign the the agreement that you know , specify exactly uh , what , you know , how how they will be contacted and they can , you know they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address , or both . and , um , then postdoc a : we did that , i i believe . phd h : right . phd e : yeah . phd h : so . a and , then , you know , say very clearly that if they do n't if we do n't hear from them , you know , as morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain period after we contact them that is implicitly giving their agreement . grad f : well , they 've already signed a form . postdoc a : and the form says phd e : and nobody nobody really reads it anyway . phd h : right . grad f : so . and the s and the form was approved by human subjects , phd h : says that . right . postdoc a : uh , the f phd h : well , if that 's i tha if that 's already if grad f : so , eh , that 's gon na be a little hard to modify . postdoc a : well , the form well , the form does n't say , if uh , you know , `` if you do n't respond by x number of days or x number of weeks `` phd h : i see . uh oh , ok . so what does it say about the the the process of of , uh y the review process ? postdoc a : it does n't have a time limit . that you 'll be provided access to the transcripts and then , uh , allowed to remove things that you 'd like to remove , before it goes to the general uh , larger audience . phd h : oh , ok . hmm . right . grad f : here . postdoc a : there you go . grad f : you can read what you already signed . phd e : i guess when i read it , um i 'm not as diligent as chuck , but i had the feeling i should probably respond and tell adam , like , `` i got this and i will do it by this date , and if you do n't hear from me by then `` you know , in other words responding to your email once , right away , saying `` as soon as you get this could you please respond . `` grad f : right . phd e : and then if you if the person thinks they 'll need more time because they 're out of town or whatever , they can tell you at that point ? because grad f : oh , i just i did n't wan na do that , because i do n't wan na have a discussion with every person if i can avoid it . phd e : well , it 's grad f : so what i wanted to do was just send it out and say `` on the fifteenth , the data is released , postdoc a : mm - hmm . grad f : if you wan na do something about it , do something about it , but that 's it `` . postdoc a : i i kind of like this . phd e : well postdoc a : yeah . phd e : ok . so , we 're assuming that phd h : well , that 's that would be great if but you should probably have a legal person look at this and make sure it 's ok . because if you if you , uh , do this and you then there 's a dispute later and , uh , some you know , someone who understands these matters concludes that they did n't have , uh , you know , enough opportunity to actually exercise their their right phd e : or they they might never have gotten the email , because although they signed this , they do n't know by which date to expect your email . and so someone whose machine is down or whatever i mean , we have no professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : in internally we know that people are there , grad f : well , ok . l let me let me reverse this . phd e : but we have no confirmation that they got the mail . grad f : so let 's say someone i send this out , and someone does n't respond . do we delete every meeting that they were in ? phd e : well , then grad f : i do n't think so . phd e : it we 're hoping that does n't happen , but that 's why there 's such a thing as registered mail grad f : that will happen . phd e : or phd h : that will happen . phd e : right . grad f : that will absolutely happen . because people do n't read their email , or they 'll read and say `` i do n't care about that , i 'm not gon na delete anything `` and they don just wo n't reply to it . phd h : maybe uh , do we have mailing addresses for these people ? grad f : no . we have what they put on the speaker form , postdoc a : well { comment } most grad f : which was just generic contact information . postdoc a : but the ones that we 're dealing with now are all local , phd h : well , then postdoc a : except the ones who i mean , we we 're totally in contact with all the ones in those two groups . phd h : mmm . ok . postdoc a : so maybe , uh , i you know , that 's not that many people and if i if , uh i i there is an advantage to having them admit and if i can help with with processing that , i will . it 's it 's there is an advantage to having them be on record as having received the mail and indicating grad f : yeah . i mean i thought we had discussed this , like , a year ago . postdoc a : yes , we did . grad f : and so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again . postdoc a : you 're right . well , i you know . but sometimes professor b : well , we we have n't experienced it before . postdoc a : that 's right . professor b : right ? so phd e : you 'll either wonder at the beginning or you 'll wonder at the end . postdoc a : need to get it right . phd e : i mean , there 's no way to get around i it 's pretty much the same am amount of work except for an additional email just saying they got the email . postdoc a : yeah . phd e : and maybe it 's better legally to wonder before you know , a little bit earlier than grad f : well postdoc a : it 's much easier to explain this way . grad f : ok . well , why do n't you talk t postdoc a : t t to have it on record . grad f : morgan , can you talk to our lawyer about it , and find out what the status is on this ? cuz i do n't wan na do something that we do n't need to . postdoc a : yeah , but w mmm . grad f : because what i 'm telling you , people wo n't respond to the email . no matter what you do , you there 're gon na be people who you 're gon na have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with . postdoc a : well , then we make the effort . grad d : i mean , i it 's k grad f : and do we want to spend that effort ? postdoc a : we make the effort . grad d : it 's kind of like signing up for a mailing list . they have opt in and opt out . and there are two different ways . i mean , and either way works probably , i mean . postdoc a : except i really think in this case i i 'm agr i agree with liz , that we need to be in the clear and not have to after the fact say `` oh , but i assumed `` , and `` oh , i 'm sorry that your email address was just accumulating mail without notifying you `` , you know . professor b : if this is a purely administrative task , we can actually have administration do it . postdoc a : oh , excellent . professor b : but the thing is that , you know , i i i think , without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers , from my previous conversations with them , my my sense very much is that we would want something on record as indicating that they actually were aware of this . grad f : well , we had talked about this before professor b : mm - hmm . grad f : and i thought that we had even gone by the lawyers asking about that and they said you have to s they 've already signed away the f with that form that they 've already signed once . postdoc a : i do n't remember that this issue of the time period allowed for response was ever covered . grad f : yeah . professor b : yeah . we never really talked about that . phd e : or the date at which they would be receiving the email from you . postdoc a : or or how they would indicate professor b : yeah . phd e : they probably forgot all about it . professor b : we certainly did n't talk , uh , about with them at all about , uh , the manner of them being made the , uh , uh , materials available . phd e : yeah . phd h : we do it like with these professor b : that was something that was sort of just within our implementation . phd h : we can use it we can use a a ploy like they use to , um you know , that when they serve , like uh , uh , uh { comment } uh , you know , like dead - beat dads , they they they make it look like they won something in the lottery and then they open the envelope grad d : and they 're served . phd h : and that right ? because and then the the the the thing is served . so you just make it , you know , `` oh , you won you know , go to this web site and you 've , uh you 're `` phd e : that 's why you never open these things that come in the mail . postdoc a : that one . professor b : yeah . grad f : well , it 's just , we 've gone from one extreme to the other , where at one point , a few months ago , morgan was you were saying let 's not do anything , phd h : right . right . no , it i it might postdoc a : well , it does n't matter . phd h : i i it it might well be the case grad f : and now we 're we 're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature ? phd h : it might right . grad f : i mean , what are we gon na doing here ? phd h : it might well be the case that that this is perfectly you know , this is enough to give us a basis t to just , eh , assume their consent if they do n't reply . professor b : well . grad f : mm - hmm . phd h : but , i 'm not you know , me not being a lawyer , i would n't just wan na do that without having the the expert , uh , opinion on that . postdoc a : and how many people ? al - altogether we 've got twenty people . these people are people who read their email almost all the time . grad f : then i think we had better find out , so that we can find a phd h : yeah . professor b : let me look at this again . grad f : right . postdoc a : i i really do n't see that it 's a problem . i i think that it 's a common courtesy to ask them uh , to expect for them to , uh , be able to have @ @ { comment } us try to contact them , grad f : for for th postdoc a : u just in case they had n't gotten their email . i think they 'd appreciate it . professor b : yeah . my adam , my my view before was about the nature of what was of the presentation , grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : of of how my my the things that we 're questioning were along the lines of how easy uh , h how m how much implication would there be that it 's likely you 're going to be changing something , as opposed to grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : that was the kind of dispute i was making before . postdoc a : mm - hmm . i remember that . professor b : but , um , the attorneys , i uh , i can guarantee you , the attorneys will always come back with and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things , but they will always come back with saying that , um , you need to you want to have someth some paper trail or which includes electronic trail that they have , uh , in fact o k 'd it . grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : so , um , i think that if you f i if we send the email as you have and if there 's half the people , say , who do n't respond at all by , you know , some period of time , we can just make a list of these people and hand it to , uh you know , just give it to me and i 'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever , grad f : right . professor b : and they 'll just call them up and say , you know , `` have you is is this ok ? and would you please mail you know , mail adam that it is , if i if it , you know , is or not . `` so , you know , we can we can do that . phd e : the other thing that there 's a psychological effect that at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying `` yes , i will do it `` or `` yes , i got your email `` , they 're more likely to actually do it { comment } later than to just ignore it . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : and of course we do n't want them to bleep things out , but it it 's a little bit better if we 're getting the their , uh , final response , once they 've answered you once than if they never answer you 'd { comment } at al at all . that 's how these mailing houses work . so , i mean , it 's not completely lost work because it might benefit us in terms of getting responses . postdoc a : mm - hmm . phd e : you know , an official ok from somebody is better than no answer , even if they responded that they got your email . and they 're probably more likely to do that once they 've responded that they got the email . postdoc a : i also think they 'd just simply appreciate it . i think it 's a good a good way of of fostering goodwill among our subjects . well , our participants . professor b : i think the main thing is i mean , what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases . grad f : sending lots of spam . professor b : so they s so so tha - that 's what they 're paid to do . and so , it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something and they would n't actually hear from us , and then they find this thing is in there and we 've already distributed it to someone . so , what it says in there , in fact , is that they will be given an opportunity to blah - blah - blah , postdoc a : mm - hmm . professor b : but if in fact if we sent them something or we thought we sent them something but they did n't actually receive it for some reason , um , then we have n't given them that . grad f : well , so how far do we have to go ? do we need to get someone 's signature ? or , is email enough ? professor b : i i i em email is enough . grad f : do we have to have it notarized ? i mean ok . professor b : yeah . i mean , i 've been through this i mean , i 'm not a lawyer , but i 've been through these things a f things f like this a few times with lawyers now grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : so i i i i 'm pretty comfortable with that . phd c : do you track , um , when people log in to look at the ? grad f : uh . if they submit the form , i get it . phd c : uh - huh . grad f : if they do n't submit the form , it goes in the general web log . but that 's not sufficient . right ? cuz if someone just visits the web site that does n't imply anything in particular . phd c : except that you know they got the mail . postdoc a : mm - hmm . that 's right . grad f : right . postdoc a : i i could get you on the notify list if you want me to . grad f : i 'm already on it . postdoc a : for that directory ? ok , great . grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : so again , hopefully , um , this should n't be quite as odious a problem either way , uh , in any of the extremes we 've talked about because uh , we 're talking a pretty small number of people . grad f : w for this set , i 'm not worried , because we basically know everyone on it . professor b : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad f : you know , they 're all more or less here or it 's it 's eric and dan and so on . but for some of the others , you 're talking about visitors who are gone from icsi , whose email addresses may or may not work , professor b : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad f : and so what are we gon na do when we run into someone that we ca n't get in touch with ? postdoc a : i do n't think , uh they 're so recent , these visitors . grad f : mm - hmm . postdoc a : i and and i they 're also so professor b : mm - hmm . postdoc a : they 're prominent enough that they 're easy to find through i i mean , i i w i 'll be able to if you have any trouble finding them , i really think i could find them . grad f : other methods ? ok . professor b : yeah . cuz it what it what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission . um , and i think , you know , if you go into a room and close the door and and ask their permission and they 're not there , it does n't seem { comment } that that 's the intent of , uh , meaning here . so . grad f : well , the qu the question is just whether how active it has to be . i mean , because they they filled out a contact information and that 's where i 'm sending the information . professor b : right . grad f : and so far everyone has done email . there is n't anyone who did , uh , any other contact method . professor b : well , the way icsi goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc have forwards to other accounts and so on . grad f : yeah . professor b : so it 's unusual that that they , uh grad f : so my original impression was that that was sufficient , that if they give us contact information and that contact information is n't accurate that we fulfilled our burden . professor b : yeah . phd e : then they just come back . phd c : all my files were still here . phd e : same as us . postdoc a : i just professor b : so if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe i will call the attorney about it . phd c : yeah . professor b : but , you know , hopefully we wo n't need to . postdoc a : i d i just do n't think we will . for all the reasons that we 've discussed . grad f : alright . professor b : so we 'll we 'll see if we do or not . grad f : yep . and we 'll see how many people respond to that email . postdoc a : yeah . grad f : so far , two people have . professor b : yeah . i think very few people will and and and , you know , people people see long emails about things that they do n't think is gon na be high priority , they typically , uh , do n't do n't read it , or half read it . grad f : right . professor b : cuz people are swamped . postdoc a : and actually , professor b : but postdoc a : um , i i did n't anticipate this so i that 's why i did n't give this comment , and it i this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow - up email within the next couple of days saying `` by the way , you know , we wan na hear back from you by x date and please `` , and then add what liz said `` please , uh , respond to please indicate you received this mail . `` professor b : uh , or e well , maybe even additionally , uh , um , `` even if you 've decided you have no changes you 'd like to make , if you could tell us that `` . grad f : respond to the email . { comment } yep . postdoc a : mm - hmm . it is the first time through the cycle . professor b : yeah . phd e : right . that would that would definitely work on me . you know , it makes you feel m like , um , if you were gon na p if you 're predicting that you might not answer , you have a chance now to say that . whereas , i i mean , i would be much more likely myself , phd c : and the other th phd e : given all my email , t to respond at that point , saying `` you know what , i 'm probably not gon na get to it `` or whatever , rather than just having seen the email , thinking i might get to it , and never really , uh , pushing myself to actually do it until it 's too late . phd c : yeah . i was i was thinking that it also lets them know that they do n't have to go to the page to accept this . phd e : right . r right . that 's true . professor b : right . phd c : i mean , i i yeah . so that way they could they can see from that email that if they just write back and say `` i got it , no changes `` , they 're off the hook . professor b : yeah . phd c : they do n't have to go to the web page professor b : i mean , the other thing i 've learned from dealing with dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth , uh , is , um , if you say `` you 've got three months to do this review `` , um , people do it , you know , two and seven eighths months from now . phd c : and phd e : yeah . that 's true . professor b : if you say `` you 've got three weeks to do this review `` , they do do it , you know , two and seven eighths weeks from now they do the review . grad f : right . professor b : and , um so , if we make it a little less time , i do n't think it 'll be that much grad f : well , and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth , that means we better give them deadline of the first , if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time . professor b : there 's the responding part and there 's also what if , uh , i mean , i hope this does n't happen , what if there are a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes ? grad f : right . professor b : then we actually have to deal with that postdoc a : mm - hmm . some lead time . professor b : if we want it to grad f : ugh ! disk space , postdoc a : by the way , has has jeremy signed the form ? grad f : oh my god ! i had n't thought about that . that for every meeting any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of . phd c : just that channel . grad d : ca n't you just do that channel ? phd c : oh , no . we have to do grad f : no , of course not . phd e : yeah . you have to do all of them , grad f : you need all the channels . phd c : do you have to do the other close - talking ? phd e : as well as all of these . grad d : yeah . phd e : you have to do all you could just do it in that time period , though , grad f : yes . absolutely . there 's a lot of cross - talk . postdoc a : well phd e : but i guess it 's a pain . grad f : well , but you have to copy the whole file . phd e : yeah . grad f : right ? because we 're gon na be releasing the whole file . phd e : yeah . you 're right . postdoc a : well i you know , i think at a certain point , that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy . grad f : yeah . it 's just i hate deleting any data . so i i do n't want i really would rather make a copy of it , rather than bleep it out professor b : are you del are you bleeping it by adding ? grad f : and then overlapping . so , it 's it 's exactly a censor bleep . so what i really think is `` bleep `` professor b : i i i i understand , but is is it summing signals grad f : and then i want to professor b : or do you delete the old one and put the new one in ? grad f : i delete the old one , put the new one in . professor b : oh , ok . cuz grad f : there 's nothing left of the original signal . professor b : oh . cuz if you were summing , you could no . but anyway grad f : yeah . it would be qui quite easy to get it back again . postdoc a : but and then w i was gon na say also that the they do n't have to stay on the system , as you know , professor b : yeah . phd e : then someday we can sell the unedited versions . postdoc a : cuz cuz the the ones grad f : say again ? postdoc a : once it 's been successfully bleeped , ca n't you rely on the ? phd c : or we 'll tell people the frequency of the beep professor b : encrypt it . phd c : and then they could subtract the beep out . grad d : you can hide it . yeah . postdoc a : ca n't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version ? phd h : oh , yeah . grad d : it would n't be that hard to hide it . phd e : right . exactly . i see . grad f : yeah , that 's true . yeah . yep , that 's true . phd e : see , this is good . i wanted to create some side conversations in these meetings . professor b : yeah . you could encrypt it , you know , with a with a two hundred bit thousand bit , uh grad d : you can use spread spectrum . phd c : uh - huh . grad d : hide it . phd e : so phd c : here we go . phd e : yeah . yeah . grad d : yeah , there you go . phd e : cuz we do n't have enough asides . phd h : i have an idea . you reverse the signal , grad d : there you go . phd h : so it it lets people say what they said backwards . grad f : backwards . grad d : then you have , like , subliminal , uh , messages , grad f : but , ha you 've seen the this the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments . phd h : yeah . grad d : like . grad f : did you read that paper ? it would n't work . the speech recognizer still works . phd e : yeah . and if you do it backward then professor b : yeah . phd c : that 's cuz they use forward - backward . phd e : h - good old hmm . grad f : forward but backward . that 's right . phd e : no , it 's backward - forward . grad f : good point . a point . well , i 'm sorry if i sound a little peeved about this whole thing . it 's just we 've had meeting after meeting after meeting a on this and it seems like we 've never gotten it resolved . professor b : well , but we never also we 've also never done it . postdoc a : this is the first cycle . phd e : if it makes grad f : yeah . postdoc a : there 're bound to be some glitches the first time through . professor b : so . and , uh and i 'm sorry responding without , uh , having much knowledge , but the thing is , uh , i am , like , one of these people who gets a gazillion mails and and stuff comes in as grad f : well , and that 's exactly why i did it the way i did it , which is the default is if you do nothing we 're gon na release it . professor b : yeah . grad f : because , you know , i have my stack of emails of to d to be done , that , you know , fifty or sixty long , and the ones at the top i 'm never gon na get to . professor b : right . grad f : and , uh so so phd c : move them to the bottom . professor b : so so the only thing we 're missing is is some way to respond to easily to say , uh , `` ok , go ahead `` or something . grad f : yeah , right . so , i this is gon na mean phd c : just re - mail them to yourself and then they 're at the bottom . professor b : yeah . grad f : yeah . postdoc a : yeah . grad f : yeah . that 's actually definitely a good point . the m email does n't specify that you can just reply to the email , as op as opposed to going to the form postdoc a : mm - hmm . phd h : in postdoc a : and it also does n't give a a specific i did n't think of it . phd e : right . grad f : and postdoc a : s i think it 's a good idea an ex explicit time by which this will be considered definite . grad f : yeah , release . postdoc a : and and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint . professor b : yeah . it 's converging . postdoc a : yeah . that 's right . phd h : this um , i 've seen this recently . uh , i got email , and it i if i use a mime - capable mail reader , it actually says , you know , click on this button to confirm receipt of the of the mail . postdoc a : oh , that 's interesting . phd h : so grad f : you you can grad d : it 's like certified mail . grad f : a lot of mailers support return receipt . postdoc a : could do that . phd h : right . grad f : but it does n't confirm that they 've read it . phd h : no , no , no . this is different . this is not so , i i know , you can tell , you know , the , uh , mail delivery agent to to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox . grad f : right . phd h : but but , no . this was different . ins - in the mail , there was a grad f : oh , just a button . phd h : uh , th there was a button that when you clicked on it , it would send , uh , you know , a actual acknowledgement to the sender that you had actually looked at the mail . grad f : oh , yeah . yeah . unfor - yeah , we could do that . but i hate that . phd h : but it o but it only works for , you know , mime - capable you know , if you use netscape or something like that for your n grad f : yeah . professor b : and phd e : you might as well just respond to the mail . professor b : and we actually need a third thing . phd e : i mean phd h : right . professor b : it 's not that you 've looked at it , it 's that you 've looked at it and and and agree with one of the possible actions . phd h : no , no . you can do that . professor b : right ? phd h : you know , you can put this button anywhere you want , professor b : oh ? oh , i see . phd h : and you can put it the bottom of the message and say `` here , by you know , by clicking on this , i i agree uh , you know , i acknowledge `` professor b : that i i my first - born children are yours , and yeah . yeah . phd e : quick question . are , um grad f : well , i could put a url in there without any difficulty and even pretty simple mime readers can do that . so . postdoc a : but why should n't they just email back ? i do n't see there 's a problem . professor b : yeah . grad f : yeah . reply . phd h : right . postdoc a : it 's very nice . i i like the high - tech aspect of it , professor b : yeah . postdoc a : but i think phd h : no , no , no . i actually do n't . postdoc a : i appreciate it . phd h : i 'm just saying that grad f : well , i cuz i use a text mail reader . phd h : if ev but i 'm phd e : do n't you use vi for your mai ? phd h : yeah . professor b : wow . that 's that 's my guy . alright . grad f : you you read email in vi ? phd h : yeah . postdoc a : yeah . i like vi . phd h : so i i there 's these logos that you can put at the bottom of your web page , like `` powered by vi `` . grad d : yeah . i see . phd e : anyway , quick question . grad f : you could put wed bugs in the email . phd h : yeah . phd e : like , there were three meetings this time , or so or how many ? six ? but , no of different people . so i guess if you 're in both these types of meetings , you 'd have a lot . but how i mean , it also depends on how many like , if we release this time it 's a fairly small number of meetings , but what if we release , like , twenty - five meetings to people ? in th grad f : well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails every time a meeting has been checked and is ready . phd e : i do n't know . oh . oh , ok . so this time was just the first chunk . ok . grad f : so . tha - that was my intention . it 's just yeah that we just happened to have a bunch all at once . phd e : well , that 's a good idea . grad f : i mean , maybe is that the way it 's gon na be , you think , jane ? postdoc a : i agree with you . it 's we could do it , uh i i could i 'd be happy with either way , batch - wise what i was thinking uh , so this one that was exactly right , that we had a uh , uh i i had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready . do n't have it . but , uh , this was the biggest clump i could do by a time where i thought it was reasonable . professor b : mm - hmm . postdoc a : people would be able to check it and still have it ready by then . my , um i was thinking that with the nsa meetings , i 'd like there are three of them , and they 're uh , i i will have them done by monday . uh , unfortunately the time is later and i do n't know how that 's gon na work out , but i thought it 'd be good to have that released as a clump , too , because then , you know , they 're they they have a it it 's in a category , it 's not quite so distracting to them , is what i was thinking , and it 's all in one chu but after that , when we 're caught up a bit on this process , then , um , i could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available . i could do it either way . i mean , it 's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking . professor b : we heard anything from ibm ? at all ? phd c : uh . let 's see . we yeah , right . so we got the transcript back from that one meeting . everything seemed fine . adam had a script that will put everything back together and there was well , there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix . and then , um , we , uh i sent him a pointer to three more . and so he 's off and working on those . grad f : yeah . now we have n't actually had anyone go through that meeting , to see whether the transcript is correct and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff . postdoc a : that 's on my list . grad f : so at some point we need to do that . phd c : yeah . postdoc a : well , that 's on my list . phd c : yeah . it 's gon na have to go through our regular process . grad f : i mean , the one thing i noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels . there are a fair number of `` yeahs `` and `` uh - huhs `` that it 's just that are n't in there . so . professor b : but i think yeah . like you said , i mean , that 's that 's gon na be our standard proc that 's what the transcribers are gon na be spending most of their time doing , i would imagine , postdoc a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . professor b : once once we grad f : yes , absolutely . yeah . postdoc a : one question about the backchannels . professor b : it 's gon na postdoc a : do you suppose that was because they were n't caught by the pre - segmenter ? grad f : yes , absolutely . absolutely . postdoc a : oh , interesting . oh , interesting . ok . grad f : yeah . they 're they 're not in the segmented . it 's not that the ibm people did n't do it . just they did n't get marked . postdoc a : ok . so maybe when the detector for that gets better or something i w i there 's another issue which is this we 've been , uh , contacted by university of washington now , of course , to , um we sent them the transcripts that correspond to those six meetings and they 're downloading the audio files . so they 'll be doing that . chuck 's chuck 's , uh , put that in . phd c : mm - hmm . yeah , i pointed them to the set that andreas put , uh , on the web so th if they want to compare directly with his results they can . and , um , then once , uh , th we can also point them at the , um , uh , the original meetings and they can grab those , too , with scp . phd e : wait . so you put the reference files ? phd c : no , no . they d they wanted the audio . phd e : or the ? phd c : jane sent them the , uh , transcripts . phd e : no , i mean of the transcripts . um . well , we can talk about it off - line . phd c : mm - hmm . grad f : there 's another meeting in here , what , at four ? right ? yeah , so we have to finish by three forty - five . phd h : d d so , does washi - does does uw wan na u do this wan na use this data for recognition or for something else ? phd c : uh , for recognition . phd e : i think they 're doing w did n't they want to do language modeling on , you know , recognition - compatible transcripts phd h : oh . i see . postdoc a : this is to show you , uh , some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure . professor b : yeah . phd e : or ? postdoc a : um @ @ { comment } so , this is from one of the nsa meetings and , uh , i if you 're familiar with the diff format , the arrow to the left is what it was , and the arrow to the right is what it was changed to . so , um . and now the first one . `` ok . so , then we started a weekly meeting . the last time , uh `` and the transcriber thought `` little too much `` but , uh , really , um , it was `` we learned too much `` , which makes more sense syntactically as well . phd h : and these the parentheses were f from postdoc a : then oh , this that 's the convention for indicating uncertain . grad f : u uncertains . postdoc a : so the transcriber was right . you know , she was uncertain about that . so she 's right to be uncertain . and it 's also a g a good indication of the of that . phd h : oh . { comment } ok . postdoc a : the next one . this was about , uh , claudia and she 'd been really b busy with stuff , such as waivers . uh , ok . um , next one . um . this was an interesting one . so the original was `` so that 's not so claudia 's not the bad master here `` , and then he laughs , but it really `` web master `` . grad f : web master . grad d : oh . { comment } uh - oh . postdoc a : and then you see another type of uncertainty which is , you know , they just did n't know what to make out of that . so instead of `` split upon unknown `` , { comment } it 's `` split in principle `` . grad d : jane , these are from ibm ? grad f : spit upon ? grad d : the top lines ? postdoc a : no , no . these are these are our local transcriptions of the nsa meetings . grad f : no , these are ours . postdoc a : the transcribers transcriber 's version ver versus the checked version . grad d : oh . oh , i see . postdoc a : my my checked version , after i go through it . um , then you get down here . um . sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms . that 's the next example , the next one . the , uh , version beyond this is so instead of saying `` or `` , especially those words , `` also `` and `` oder `` and some other ones . those sneak in . um , the next one grad f : that 's cool . phd h : discourse markers . discourse markers . postdoc a : sorry , what ? discourse markers ? sure . sure , sure , sure . phd h : discourse markers . postdoc a : and it 's and it makes sense phd h : yeah . yeah . postdoc a : cuz it 's , like , below this it 's a little subliminal there . phd h : yeah . yeah , yeah . postdoc a : um . ok , the next one , uh , this is a term . the problem with terminology . description with th the transcriber has `` x as an advance `` . but really it 's `` qs in advance `` . i mean , i i 've benefited from some of these , uh , cross - group meetings . ok , then you got , um , uh , instead of `` from something - or - other cards `` , { comment } it 's `` for multicast `` . and instead of `` ann system related `` , it 's `` end system related `` . this was changed to an acronym initially and it should should n't have been . and then , you can see here `` gps `` was misinterpreted . it 's just totally understanda this is this is a lot of jargon . um , and the final one , the transcriber had th `` in the core network itself or the exit unknown , not the internet unknown `` . and it it comes through as `` in the core network itself of the access provider , not the internet backbone core `` . now this is a lot of terminology . and they 're generally extremely good , but , you know in this this area it really does pay to , um to double check and i 'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you 'll see s substantial improvements in performance cuz the you know , there 're a lot of these in there . phd h : yeah . so how often ? grad f : yeah , but i bet i bet they 're acoustically challenging parts anyway , though . postdoc a : no , actually no . huh - uh . grad f : oh , really ? uh , it 's oh , so it 's just jargon . postdoc a : it 's jargon . yeah . i mean this is cuz , you know you do n't realize in daily life how much you have top - down influences in what you 're hearing . phd h : well , but postdoc a : and it 's jar it 's jargon coupled with a foreign accent . phd h : but but but we do n't i mean , our language model right now does n't know about these words anyhow . so , professor b : yeah . phd h : you know , un until you actually get a decent language model , @ @ { comment } adam 's right . grad f : it probably wo n't do any better . phd h : you probably wo n't notice a difference . but it 's i mean , it 's definitely good that these are fixed . i mean , obviously . postdoc a : well , also from the standpoint of getting people 's approval , professor b : yeah . postdoc a : cuz if someone sees a page full of uh , um , barely decipherable w you know , sentences , and then is asked to approve of it or not , it 's , uh , uh grad f : did i say that ? professor b : yeah . yeah . that would be a shame if people said `` well , i do n't approve it because the it 's not what i said `` . grad f : well , that 's exactly why i put the extra option in , professor b : yeah . postdoc a : exactly . that 's why we discussed that . professor b : yeah . grad f : is that i was afraid people would say , `` let 's censor that because it 's wrong `` , professor b : yeah . grad f : and i do n't want them to do that . postdoc a : and then i also the final thing i have for transcription is that i made a purchase of some other headphones because of the problem of low gain in the originals . and and they very much appro they mu much prefer the new ones , and actually i i mean , i i think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the the choice . we 'd originally chosen , uh , very expensive head headsets grad f : yeah . ugh ! postdoc a : but , um , they 're just not as good as these , um , in this with this respect to this particular task . phd h : well , return the old ones . grad f : it 's probably impedance matching problems . postdoc a : i do n't know exactly , grad f : but postdoc a : but we chose them because that 's what 's been used here by prominent projects in transcription . professor b : could be . postdoc a : so it i we had every reason to think they would work . grad f : mm - hmm . phd h : so you have spare headsets ? postdoc a : sorry , what ? phd h : you have spare headsets ? grad f : they 're just earphones . they 're not headsets . they 're not microphones . phd e : right . phd h : no , no . i mean , just earphones ? um , because i , uh , i could use one on my workstation , just to t because sometimes i have to listen to audio files and i do n't have to b go borrow it from someone and postdoc a : we have actua actually i have w well , the thing is , that if we have four people come to work for a day , i was i was hanging on to the others for , eh for spares , phd h : oh , ok . postdoc a : but i can tell you what i recommend . professor b : no , but you 'd if you yeah , w we should get it . phd h : sure . no problem . grad f : but if you need it , just get it . phd h : i just grad f : come on . phd h : right . professor b : yeah . if you need it . phd h : yeah . professor b : yeah . postdoc a : it 'd just have to be a s a separate order an added order . grad d : yeah , i still i still need to get a pair , too . professor b : they 're they 're they 're they 're pretty inexpensive . phd e : yeah , that we should order a cou uh , t two or three or four , actually . professor b : yeah . grad d : i 'm using one of these . yeah . phd e : we have phd h : i think i have a pair that i brought from home , but it 's f just for music listening professor b : no . just just just just buy them . phd e : sh - just get the model number phd h : and it 's not nnn . yeah . professor b : just buy them . phd e : and where do you buy these from ? phd h : yeah . postdoc a : cambridge soundworks , just down the street . phd e : like ? you just b go and b postdoc a : yeah . they always have them in stock . professor b : yeah . phd e : that 'd be a good idea . phd h : anyway . professor b : yeah . grad f : w uh , could you email out the brand ? postdoc a : oh , sure . yeah . ok . grad f : cuz i think sounds like people are interested . grad d : yeah . professor b : yeah . grad d : definitely . postdoc a : it 's made a difference in in how easy . yeah . professor b : i realized something i should talk about . so what 's the other thing on the agenda actually ? grad f : uh , the only one was don wanted to , uh , talk about disk space yet again . grad d : yeah . u it 's short . i mean , if you wan na go , we can just throw it in at the end . professor b : no , no . why do n't you why do n't you go ahead since it 's short . grad d : um , well , uh . grad f : oh , i thought you meant the disk space . yeah , we know disk space is short . phd h : the disk space was short . yeah . that 's what i thought too . phd e : that 's a great ambiguity . professor b : yeah . phd e : it 's one of these it 's it 's social professor b : it 's i i i it i phd e : and , uh , discourse level grad d : yeah . phd e : and professor b : yeah , it 's great . yeah , phd e : sorry . professor b : double double grad f : yeah , it was really goo phd e : see , if i had that little scratch - pad , i would have made an x there . grad d : thank you , thank you . grad f : uh , well , we 'll give you one then . professor b : yeah . grad d : um . so , um , without thinking about it , when i offered up my hard drive last week grad f : oh , no . grad d : um , this is always a suspect phrase . phd e : it was while i was out of town . grad d : but , um , no . i , uh i realized that we 're going to be doing a lot of experiments , um , o for this , uh , paper we 're writing , so we 're probably gon na need a lot more we 're probably gon na need that disk space that we had on that eighteen gig hard drive . but , um , we also have someone else coming in that 's gon na help us out with some stuff . professor b : we 've just ordered a hundred gigabytes . grad d : so ok . we just need to phd e : i think we need , like , another eighteen gig disk to be safe . professor b : well , we 're getting three thirty thirty - sixes . right ? that are going into the main f file server . phd c : markham 's ordering and they should be coming in soon . grad d : w well . so so grad f : soon ? grad d : yeah . i mean , i guess the thing is is , all i need is to hang it off , like , the person who 's coming in , sonali 's , computer . phd h : oh , so so , you mean the d the internal the disks on the machines that we just got ? grad d : whew . or we can move them . phd c : these are gon na go onto abbott . grad f : ne - new disks . phd h : or extra disk ? professor b : onto abbott , the file server . grad d : so are we gon na move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in ? grad f : on phd h : oh , oh . ok . grad f : yeah . phd e : uh , i grad f : once they come in . sure . grad d : ok . that 's fine . phd e : do when when is this planned for roughly ? phd c : they should be i i imagine next week or something . phd e : ok . so grad f : if you 're if you 're desperate , i have some space on my drive . grad d : i think if i 'm grad f : but i i vacillate between no space free and a few gig free . grad d : yeah . i think i can find something if i 'm desperate phd e : yeah . grad d : and , um , in the meantime i 'll just hold out . that was the only thing i wanted to bring up . phd c : it should be soon . we we should professor b : so there 's another hundred gig . so . grad d : alright . great . phd h : mm - hmm . professor b : ok . it 's great to be able to do it , grad d : that 's it . professor b : just say `` oh yeah , a hundred gig , phd e : good . professor b : no big deal `` . grad d : yeah . grad f : yeah . a hundred gig here , a hundred gig there . phd e : well , each meeting is like a gig or something , grad f : it 's eventually real disk space . professor b : yeah . phd e : so it 's really professor b : yeah . um . yeah . i was just going to comment that i i 'm going to , uh , be on the phone with mari tomorrow , late afternoon . grad f : oh , yeah . professor b : we 're supposed to get together and talk about , uh , where we are on things . uh , there 's this meeting coming up , uh , and there 's also an annual report . now , i never actually i i was asking about this . i do n't really quite understand this . she was re she was referring to it as i think this actually did n't just come from her , but this is what , uh , darpa had asked for . um , she 's referring to it as the an annual report for the fiscal year . but of course the fiscal year starts in october , so i do n't quite understand w w why we do an annual report that we 're writing in july . phd c : she 's either really late or really early . grad f : huh . or she 's getting a good early start . professor b : uh , i think basically it it 's none of those . it 's that the meeting is in july so they so darpa just said do an annual report . so . so . so anyway , i 'll be putting together stuff . i 'll do it , uh , you know , as much as i can without bothering people , just by looking at at papers and status reports . i mean , the status reports you do are very helpful . uh , so i can grab stuff there . and if , uh if i have some questions i 'll grad f : when we remember to fill them out . professor b : yeah . if people could do it as soon as as you can , if you have n't done one si recently . uh . uh , but , you know , i 'm i 'm sure before it 's all done , i 'll end up bugging people for for more clarification about stuff . um . but , um , i do n't know , i guess i guess i know pretty much what people have been doing . we have these meetings and and there 's the status reports . uh . but , um . um . yeah . so that was n't a long one . just to tell you that . and if something has n't , uh i 'll be talking to her late tomorrow afternoon , and if something has n't been in a status report and you think it 's important thing to mention on this kind of thing , uh , uh , just pop me a one - liner and and and i 'll i 'll have it in front of me for the phone conversation . uh . i guess , uh , you you 're still pecking away at the demos and all that , probably . grad f : yep . and don is gon na be helping out with that . professor b : oh , that 's right . grad f : did you wan na talk about that this afternoon ? not here , but later today ? grad d : we should probably talk off - line about when we 're gon na talk off - line . grad f : ok . ok . professor b : ok . yeah , i might want to get updated about it in about a week cuz , um , i 'm actually gon na have a a few days off the following week , a after the after the picnic . so . grad f : oh , ok . professor b : that 's all i had . grad f : so we were gon na do sort of status of speech transcription automatic transcription , but we 're kind of running late . so . phd e : how long does it take you to save the data ? grad f : fifteen minutes . phd e : yeah . grad f : so . if you wan na do a quick phd e : yeah . grad f : ten minute phd e : guess we should stop , like , twenty of at the latest . professor b : uh phd e : we we have another meeting coming in that they wan na record . professor b : and there 's the digits to do . so maybe may maybe maybe grad f : yeah . well , we can skip the digits . professor b : we could . fi - five minute report or something . phd e : it 's up to you . i do n't professor b : yeah , yeah . grad f : whatever you want . professor b : well , i would love to hear about it , grad f : what do you have to say ? professor b : especially since grad f : i 'm interested , so professor b : yeah . well , i 'm gon na be on the phone tomorrow , so this is just a good example of the sort of thing i 'd like to hear about . phd e : wait . why is everybody looking at me ? phd c : i do n't know . grad f : sorry . professor b : cuz he looked at you phd h : what ? professor b : and says you 're sketching . phd e : uh . i 'm not sure what you were referring to . phd h : i i i i 'm not actually , i 'm not sure what ? are we supposed to have done something ? grad f : no . we were just talking before about alternating the subject of the meeting . phd e : uh - huh . grad f : and this week we were gon na try to do t automatic transcription status . phd h : alternating . phd e : i was n't here last week . sorry . grad f : but we sort of failed . phd h : we did that last week . right ? professor b : i thought we did . grad f : did we ? ok . phd h : yeah . we did . grad f : ok . so now now we have the schedule . so next week we 'll do automatic transcription status , plus anything that 's real timely . phd e : oh . ok . professor b : ok . whew ! phd c : good update . grad f : whew ! professor b : that was grad f : dodged that bullet . professor b : yeah . nicely done , liz . postdoc a : a woman of few words . professor b : but but lots of prosody . ok . ok . phd h : uh , i mean , we we really have n't done anything . grad f : excuse me ? phd h : sorry . postdoc a : well , since last week . phd e : yeah , we 're phd h : i mean , the the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the , um the automatic alignments because , uh , i got some i i i learned from thilo what data we can use as a benchmark to see how well we 're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech or , of the foreground speech with background speech . grad f : yeah . phd e : and then , uh , i guess , the new data that don will start to process phd h : but , we have n't actually phd e : the , um when he can get these you know , before we were working with these segments that were all synchronous and that caused a lot of problems because you have timed sp at on either side . grad f : oh . right , right . mm - hmm . phd e : and so that 's sort of a stage - two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries with them is really the next step . grad f : right . postdoc a : i 'll be interested . phd e : we did get our , um i guess , good news . we got our abstract accepted for this conference , um workshop , isca workshop , in , um , uh , new jersey . and we sent in a very poor abstract , but they very poor , very quick . um , but we 're hoping to have a paper for that as well , which should be an interesting grad f : when 's it due ? phd e : the t paper is n't due until august . the abstracts were already due . so it 's that kind of workshop . grad f : mm - hmm . phd e : but , i mean , the good news is that that will have sort of the european experts in prosody sort of a different crowd , and i think we 're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far , so that should be interesting . postdoc a : what 's the name of the meeting ? phd e : uh , it 's isca workshop on prosody in speech recognition and understanding , or something like that phd h : it 's called prosody to grad f : mm - hmm . postdoc a : good . phd e : some generic uh , so it 's focused on using prosody in automatic systems and there 's a um , a web page for it . professor b : y you going to , uh , eurospeech ? yeah . grad f : i do n't have a paper phd h : yeah . grad f : but i 'd kinda like to go , if i could . is that alright ? professor b : we 'll discuss it . grad f : ok . i guess that 's `` no `` . professor b : my my my car my car needs a good wash , by the way . grad f : ok . well , that th hey , if that 's what it takes , that 's fine with me . i 'll pick up your dry - cleaning , too . should we do digits ? professor b : yeah . phd h : can i go next ? because i have to leave , actually . grad f : yep . go for it . hmm ! thanks . thank you ."}
{"id": 323, "category": "summarization", "type": "Report", "lang": "en", "task": "[Instruction] Summarize this government report: \n  \nAdoption of Military Animals, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2583\nThis statute provides, in part: \"The Secretary of the military department concerned may make a military animal of such military department available for adoption ... under circumstances as follows: (1) At the end of the animal's useful life. (2) Before the end of the animal's useful life, if such Secretary ... determines that unusual or extraordinary circumstances justify [it]. (3) When the animal is otherwise excess to the needs of such military department.\" The statute defines \"military animal\" as \"[a] military working dog\" or \"[a] horse owned by the Department of Defense.\" When this statute was first enacted in 2000, it applied only to military working dogs; prior to then, under Department of Defense policy, such dogs were caged, sometimes for as long as a year, and then euthanized. See 146 Cong. Rec. H 9599 (daily ed. October 10, 2000). The statute was amended to cover horses in 2006.\nAfrican Elephant Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4201-4245\nThis statute establishes an African Elephant Conservation Fund, from which the Secretary of the Interior may provide financial assistance \"for approved projects for research, conservation, management, or protection of African elephants.\" It requires the Secretary to establish a moratorium on the importation of raw and worked ivory from an ivory producing country that does not meet specified criteria, including being a party to CITES and adhering to the CITES Ivory Control System. (\"CITES\" is the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.)\nThe act imposes civil and criminal penalties on any person who, among other things, imports raw ivory from any country other than an ivory producing country, or from a country for which a moratorium is in effect, or who exports raw ivory from the United States. A person who furnishes information that leads to a civil penalty or a criminal conviction under the act may be rewarded up to one-half of any criminal or civil penalty or fine, or $25,000, whichever is less.\nAgriculture Appropriations Act, 2006, P.L. 109-97 (2005), and subsequent appropriations acts\nSection 794 of P.L. 109-97 (2005) provides:\nEffective 120 days after the date of enactment of this act, none of the funds made available by this act may be used to pay the salaries or expenses of personnel to inspect horses under section 3 of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 603) or under guidelines issued under section 903 [of] the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 1901 note; P.L. 104-127 ).\nBecause the Federal Meat Inspection Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 603, requires horses (and specified other mammals) to be inspected before they may be slaughtered for human consumption, \u00a7 794 of P.L. 109-97 , by precluding appropriated funds from being used to pay inspectors' salaries and expenses to inspect horses, would have effectively prohibited the slaughter of horses for human consumption from March 10, 2006, until September 30, 2006. The Department of Agriculture, however, on February 8, 2006, issued a regulation allowing slaughter plants to pay for inspections by the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service so that horses could continue to be slaughtered for human consumption. 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 352.19.\nThe 110 th Congress prevented the Department of Agriculture from continuing to charge slaughter plants for inspections, and it thereby effectively prohibited the slaughter of horses for human consumption. It accomplished this by prohibiting appropriated funds from being used not only, as in P.L. 109-97 , to pay salaries and expenses under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, but also from being used to implement or enforce 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 352.19, under which the Department of Agriculture allowed slaughter plants to pay for inspections. P.L. 110-161 , \u00a7 741, 121 Stat. 1881 (2007); P.L. 110-329 , Div. A, \u00a7 101, 122 Stat. 3574-3575 (2008) (incorporating provisions of P.L. 110-161 ).\nAirborne Hunting Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 742j-1\nThis statute makes it a crime (1) while in an aircraft, to shoot any bird, fish, or other animal, or (2) to use an aircraft to harass any bird, fish, or other animal. These prohibitions do not apply to persons employed by or licensed by a state or the federal government to administer or protect \"land, water, wildlife, domesticated animals, human life, or crops.\"\nAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act\nSections 1313-1314 of this act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3201-3202, authorize the Secretary of the Interior to designate zones within national preserves in Alaska \"where and when no hunting, fishing, trapping, or entry may be permitted,\" and prohibits \"the taking of fish and wildlife\" in national parks or national park system monuments in Alaska, except as specified in the act.\nSection 1005 of the act, as amended in 1990, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145, provides that the Secretary of the Interior\nshall work closely with the State of Alaska and Native Village and Regional Corporations in evaluating the impact of oil and gas exploration, development, production, and transportation and other human activities on the wildlife resources of these lands, including impacts on the Arctic and Porcupine caribou herds, polar bears, muskox, grizzly bear, wolf, wolverine, seabirds, shorebirds, and migratory waterfowl.\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213\nThis statute (together with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0791-794) prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, public services, and public accommodations. Discrimination includes refusing to make reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, and a reasonable accommodation generally includes permitting the use of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.302(c). See also, \" Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604 ,\" discussed below.\nAnadromous Fish Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 757a-757f\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to take various actions for the protection of fishery resources.\nAnimal Damage Control Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 426-426c\nThis statute directs the Secretary of Agriculture:\nto conduct investigations, experiments, and tests as he may deem necessary in order to determine, demonstrate, and promulgate the best methods of eradication, suppression, or bringing under control on national forests and other areas of the public domain as well as on State, Territory, or privately owned lands of mountain lions, wolves, bobcats, prairie dogs, gophers, ground squirrels, jack rabbits, brown tree snakes, and other animals injurious to agriculture, horticulture, forestry, animal husbandry, wild game animals, fur-bearing animals, and birds.\nThis statute was enacted in 1931 (though \"brown tree snakes\" were added in 1991). The functions of the Secretary of Agriculture under it were transferred to the Secretary of Interior in 1939, and back to Agriculture in 1985. In 1987, P.L. 100 - 202 , 101 Stat. 1329-331, added the following provision to the act:\nThe Secretary of Agriculture is authorized, except for urban rodent control, to conduct activities and enter into agreements with States, local jurisdictions, individuals, and public and private agencies, organizations, and institutions in the control of nuisance mammals and birds and those mammal and bird species that are reservoirs for zoonotic diseases, and to deposit any money collected under any such agreement into the appropriation accounts that incur the costs to be available immediately and to remain available until expended for Animal Damage Control activities.\nAnimal Disease Risk Assessment, Prevention, and Control Act of 2001, P.L. 107-9 (2001)\nThis statute requires the Department of Agriculture to submit to the House and Senate agriculture committees a preliminary report by June 23, 2001, and a final report by October 20, 2001, concerning foot-and-mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases.\nAnimal Enterprise Terrorism Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 43\nThis statute, which replaced the Animal Enterprise Protection Act of 1992, makes it a crime to \"travel[ ] in interstate or foreign commerce, or use[ ] ... the mail or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce\u2014(1) for the purpose of damaging or interfering with the operations of an animal enterprise; and (2) in connection with such purpose\u2014(A) intentionally damag[ing] or caus[ing] the loss of any real or personal property ... [or] (B) intentionally plac[ing] a person in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to that person, a member of the immediate family ... of that person, or a spouse or intimate partner of that person. ...\" The statute defines \"animal enterprise\" as:\n(A) a commercial or academic enterprise that uses or sells animals or animal products for profit, food or fiber production, agriculture, education, research, or testing;\n(B) a zoo, aquarium, animal shelter, pet store, breeder, furrier, circus, rodeo, or other lawful competitive animal event; or\n(C) any fair or similar event intended to advance agricultural arts and sciences.\nAnimal Health Protection Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8301-8321\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, if he determines it to be necessary to prevent the introduction into or dissemination with the United States of any pest or disease of livestock, to prohibit or restrict, among other things, the importation or exportation of any animal into or from the United States, the movement in interstate commerce of any animal, or the use of any means of conveyance in connection with the importation or entry of livestock. The statute also authorizes the Secretary, if it is necessary for the above purpose, to order the destruction or removal from the United States of any animal, or to seize, quarantine, or dispose of any animal.\nAnimal Welfare Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2131-2159\nThe AWA authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to \"promulgate standards to govern the humane handling, care, treatment, and transportation of animals by dealers, research facilities, and exhibitors.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2143(a)(1). Such standards must include requirements \"for animal care, treatment, and practices in experimental procedures to ensure that animal pain and distress are minimized. ...\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02143(a)(3)(A). The act also requires the Secretary to \"promulgate standards to govern the transportation in commerce, and the handling, care, and treatment in connection therewith, by intermediate handlers, air carriers, or other carriers, of animals consigned by any ... person ... for transportation in commerce.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02143(a)(4).\nThe AWA's definition of \"animal\" makes the act applicable to any warmblooded animal used \"for research, testing, experimentation, or exhibition purposes, or as a pet; but such term excludes (1) birds, rats of the genus Rattus, and mice of the genus Mus, bred for use in research, (2) horses not used for research purposes, and (3) other farm animals. ...\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02132(g). Prior to this provision's amendment by P.L. 107 - 171 (2002), \u00a7\u00a010301, it did not exclude birds, rats, or mice. Nevertheless, the Secretary had promulgated regulations that excluded birds, and rats and mice bred for use in research, from coverage under the act. A federal court found this exclusion to violate the act, but the decision was overturned on appeal on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit. Subsequently, in a case unrelated to the birds, rats, and mice question, the en banc D.C. Circuit held that a plaintiff who \"suffered [injuries] to his aesthetic interest in observing animals living under humane conditions\" had standing to sue the Secretary of Agriculture to enforce the act.\nSubsequently, another suit was brought to challenge the exclusion of birds, rats, and mice, and a federal district court, citing the D.C. Circuit case, denied the Department of Agriculture's motion to dismiss for lack of standing. As a result, the Department of Agriculture settled the case by agreeing to revise its regulations to include birds, rats, and mice. Then Congress intervened, and, in the Department of Agriculture appropriations for FY2001 ( P.L. 106 - 387 , \u00a7\u00a0772), prohibited FY2001 funds from being used to \"modify the definition of 'animal' in existing regulations pursuant to the Animal Welfare Act.\" The FY2002 appropriations contained the same prohibition ( P.L. 107 - 76 , \u00a7\u00a0732), and then P.L. 107 - 171 , \u00a7\u00a010301, amended the statute to exclude birds, rats, and mice bred for research. Section 10304 of the statute, however, directs the National Research Council, by May 13, 2003, to submit to the House and Senate Agriculture Committees \"a report on the implications of including rats, mice, and birds within the definition of animal under the regulations promulgated under the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq.).\" No report appears to have been written.\nThe AWA requires every research facility to establish an Institutional Animal Committee of at least three members, at least one of whom shall not be affiliated in any way with the facility and who is intended to represent \"general community interests in the proper care and treatment of animals.\" The Committee's responsibilities include to review practices involving pain to animals and to file a report with the Secretary. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2143(b).\nThe AWA also provides for the licensing of dealers and exhibitors (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02133) and prohibits research facilities from purchasing dogs or cats from unlicensed dealers or exhibitors (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02137). The act defines \"dealer\" in part as a person who, for compensation, transports, buys, or sells any animal \"for research, teaching, exhibition, or use as a pet,\" but it excludes from the definition a retail pet store that does not sell \"animals to a research facility, an exhibitor, or a dealer\" (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2132(f)). The act defines \"exhibitor\" to include carnivals, circuses, and zoos, but to exclude retail pet stores, state and country fairs, livestock shows, rodeos, and purebred dog and cat shows (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2132(h)).\nThe AWA also prohibits dealers and exhibitors from selling or otherwise disposing of any dog or cat within five business days after they acquire it, except that this requirement does not apply to operators of auction sales. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2135. A 1990 amendment requires public and private pounds and shelters, and research facilities licensed by the Department of Agriculture, to \"hold and care for\" any dog or cat they acquire \"for a period of not less than five days to enable such dog or cat to be recovered by its original owner or adopted by other individuals before such entity sells such dog or cat to a dealer.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2158(a). Does this provision prohibit a pound, shelter, or research facility from euthanizing a dog or cat before five days? Perhaps not on its face, but that appears to be its intent, as to read it otherwise would seem to defeat its purpose.\nAnother 1990 amendment authorized the Attorney General to seek, and federal courts to issue, injunctions against dealing in stolen animals or placing the health of an animal in serious danger in violation of the act. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2159.\nP.L. 110 - 234 , \u00a7 14210 (2008) added a new section to the AWA (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02148) that prohibits any person from importing a dog into the United States for purposes of resale unless the Secretary determines that the dog is in good health, has received all necessary vaccinations, and is at least six months old. This section does not apply, however, if a dog is imported for research purposes or veterinary treatment, or if it is imported into Hawaii from the British Isles, Australia, Guam, or New Zealand, if the dog is not transported out of Hawaii for purposes of resale at less than six months of age. P.L. 110 - 234 , \u00a7 14214, also amended the AWA (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02149(b)) to increase, from $2,500 to $10,000, the civil penalty that the Secretary of Agriculture may assess for any violation of any provision of the act, or of any rule, regulation, or standard promulgated by the Secretary.\nAnimal Fighting, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2156, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 49\nThe Animal Welfare Act, as amended, most recently by P.L. 110 - 234 , \u00a7 14207 (2008) prohibits any person \"to knowingly sponsor or exhibit an animal in an animal fighting venture,\" or \"to knowingly sell, buy, possess, train, transport, deliver, or receive any animal for the purposes of having the animal participate in an animal fighting venture.\" However,\n[w]ith respect to fighting ventures involving live birds in a State where it would not be a violation of the law, it shall be unlawful under this subsection for a person to sponsor or exhibit a bird in a fighting venture only if the person knew that any bird in the fighting venture was knowingly bought, sold, delivered, transported, or received in interstate commerce for the purpose of participation in the fighting venture.\nOn August 15, 2008, a Louisiana statute (14:102.23) took effect that made it the 50 th state (plus the District of Columbia) to outlaw cockfighting, thereby essentially rendering moot this exception in the AWA.\nP.L. 110 - 22 (2007) made it \"unlawful for any person to knowingly sell, buy, transport, or deliver in interstate or foreign commerce a knife, a gaff, or any other sharp instrument attached, or designed or intended to be attached, to the leg of a bird for use in an animal fighting venture.\" P.L. 110 - 22 also increased the penalty for violations of the animal fighting ventures section from a misdemeanor to a felony, with a maximum penalty of a fine and three years' imprisonment per violation. P.L. 110-234 , \u00a7 14207(b) (2008) then increased the maximum penalty to a fine and five years' imprisonment per violation.\nThe animal fighting section of the AWA also prohibits knowingly using the mail or any instrumentality of interstate commerce to advertise an animal, or a sharp instrument, for use in an animal fighting venture, or to promote or further an animal fighting venture, except that this prohibition applies \"to fighting ventures involving live birds only if the fight is to take place in a State where it would be in violation of the laws thereof.\"\nAntarctic Conservation Act of 1978, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401-2412\nThis statute makes it unlawful for any United States citizen, unless authorized by the Director of the National Science Foundation, to engage in commerce in any native animal or native bird taken in Antarctica.\nAntarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act of 1984, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2431-2444\nThis statute implements the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, and makes it unlawful to harvest, or knowingly to engage in commerce in any Antarctic marine living resource harvested in violation of the Convention.\nAsian Elephant Conservation Act of 1997, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4261-4266\nThis statute establishes the Asian Elephant Conservation Fund and directs the Secretary of the Interior to use amounts in the Fund for projects for the conservation of Asian elephants.\nAtlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5101-5108\nThe statute requires the Secretary of Commerce, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, to develop and implement a program to support the interstate fishery management efforts of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.\nAtlantic Salmon Convention Act of 1982, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3601-3608\nThis statute limits salmon fishing pursuant to the Convention for the Conservation of Salmon in the North Atlantic Ocean.\nAtlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5151-5158\nThis statute directs the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior to jointly declare a moratorium on fishing for Atlantic striped bass within the coastal waters of any state that does not comply with the plan for managing Atlantic striped bass that is adopted by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.\nAtlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 971-971k\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to promulgate regulations to \"limit the size of the fish and the quantity of the catch which may be taken from each area ... [and] limit or prohibit the incidental catch of a regulated species. ...\"\nBald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 668-668d\nThis statute makes it a crime to possess, buy, sell, or transport any bald or golden eagle, alive or dead, or any part, nest, or egg thereof. The Secretary of the Interior may issue regulations authorizing exceptions \"for the scientific or exhibition purposes of public museums, scientific societies, and zoological parks, or for the religious purposes of Indian tribes, or ... for the protection of wildlife or of agricultural or other interests in any particular locality. ...\"\nCaptive Wildlife Safety Act: See Lacey Act Amendments of 1981\nChimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance, and Protection Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 287a-3a\nThe CHIMP Act, P.L. 106 - 551 (2000), as amended by P.L. 110 - 170 (2007), added \u00a7 481C to the Public Health Service Act. It requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to \"provide for the establishment and operation ... of a [sanctuary] system to provide for the lifetime care of chimpanzees that have been used, or were bred or purchased for use, in research conducted or supported by the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, or other agencies of the Federal Government,\" when such \"surplus chimpanzees\" are not needed for such research. Non-federal chimpanzees may also be accepted into the system. Chimpanzees in the system may not be used in research except as specified in the statute, and must be cared for in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act.\nThe sanctuary system shall be operated by a nonprofit private entity under a contract awarded by the Secretary of HHS. The nonprofit private entity shall have a board of directors composed of not more than 13 voting members, who shall include individuals with expertise and experience in various fields, including primate veterinary care, animal protection, behavioral primatology, management of nonprofit organizations, laboratory animal medicine, and biohazards.\nCommercial Transportation of Equine for Slaughter, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 note\nThis statute, enacted as part of P.L. 104-127 , 110 Stat. 1184 (1996), provides that \"the Secretary of Agriculture may issue guidelines for the regulation of the commercial transportation of equine for slaughter by persons regularly engaged in that activity within the United States.\" Specifically, \"the Secretary of Agriculture shall review the food, water, and rest provided to equine for slaughter in transit, the segregation of stallions from other equine during transit, and such other issues as the Secretary considers appropriate.\" The Secretary's regulations implementing this statute were issued in 2001 and are published at 9 C.F.R. Part 88.\nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Acts\nP.L. 101 - 511 , \u00a7 8019 (1990) provides:\nNone of the funds appropriated by this Act or hereafter shall be used to purchase dogs or cats or otherwise fund the use of dogs or cats for the purpose of training Department of Defense students or other personnel in surgical or other medical treatment of wounds produced by any type of weapon: Provided , That the standards of such training with respect to the treatment of animals shall adhere to the Federal Animal Welfare Law and to those prevailing in the civilian medical community.\nThis provision, without the words \"or hereafter,\" had been included in Department of Defense appropriations statutes since P.L. 98 - 212 , \u00a7 791 (1984). However, because of the words \"or hereafter\" in the language quoted above, this prohibition on the use of funds continues to operate unless it is repealed.\nOther Department of Defense appropriations statutes use the phrase \"this Act or any other Act\" instead of \"this Act or hereafter.\" The Comptroller General has \"held that the words 'or any other act' do not indicate futurity, but merely extend the effect of the provisions to other appropriations available in that fiscal year.\" 65 Comp. Gen. 588, 589 (1986). The following example of the use of this phrase in connection with the use of animals in research appeared in P.L. 103 - 139 , \u00a7\u00a08044 (1993), and P.L. 104 - 61 , \u00a7 8034 (1995):\nNone of the funds provided in this Act or any other Act shall be available to conduct bone trauma research at any Army Research Laboratory until the Secretary of the Army certifies that the synthetic compound to be used in the experiments is of such a type that its use will result in a significant medical finding, the research has military application, the research will be conducted in accordance with the standards set by an animal care and use committee, and the research does not duplicate research already conducted by a manufacturer or any other research organization.\nFinally, some limitations on the use of Department of Defense funds for animal research have applied only to a particular appropriations statute. For example, P.L. 103 - 139 \u00a7 8043 (1993), and P.L. 104 - 61 , \u00a7 8032 (1995), provide:\nNone of the funds appropriated by this Act shall be available for payments under the Department of Defense contract with the Louisiana State University Medical Center involving the use of cats for Brain Missile Wound Research. ...\nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for the Fiscal Year Ending September 30, 1993\nP.L. 102 - 394 , \u00a7 213 (1992) provides:\nNo funds appropriated under this Act or subsequent Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts shall be used by the National Institutes of Health, or any other Federal agency, or recipient of Federal funds on any project that entails the capture or procurement of chimpanzees obtained from the wild. For purposes of this section, the term \"recipient of Federal funds\" includes private citizens, corporations, or other research institutions located outside the United States that are recipients of Federal funds.\nThis provision had previously appeared, without the reference to subsequent acts, in P.L. 101 - 166 , \u00a7 214 (1989), P.L. 101 - 517 , \u00a7 211 (1990), and P.L. 102 - 170 , \u00a7 213 (1991).\nDepictions of Animal Cruelty, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 48\nThis statute, enacted as P.L. 106 - 152 (1999), makes it a crime knowingly to create, sell, or possess any visual or audio \"depiction of animal cruelty with the intention of placing that depiction in interstate or foreign commerce for commercial gain.\" It provides an exception for \"any depiction that has serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.\" The statute was aimed at outlawing \"crush video\" films, in which small animals are crushed to death. A federal court of appeals has held that the statute violates the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech, and the Supreme Court has agreed to review the case. United States v. Stevens , 533 F.3d 218 (3d Cir. 2008) (en banc), cert. granted , No. 08-769 (Apr. 20, 2009).\nDingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 777-777l\nThis statute is also known as the \"Federal Aid in Fish Restoration Act\" and the \"Fish Restoration and Management Projects Act.\" It directs the Secretary of the Interior \"to cooperate with the States through their respective State fish and game departments in fish restoration and management projects.\" It includes the New England Fishery Resources Restoration Act of 1990, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 777e-1. This statute was amended by the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000, discussed below.\nDisposition of Unfit Horses And Mules, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 1308\nThis statute provides, in full:\nSubject to applicable regulations under this subtitle and title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.), horses and mules belonging to the Federal Government that have become unfit for service may be destroyed or put out to pasture, either on pastures belonging to the Government or those belonging to financially sound and reputable humane organizations whose facilities permit them to care for the horses and mules during the remainder of their natural lives, at no cost to the Government.\nDog and Cat Protection Act of 2000, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1308\nThis statute, P.L. 106 - 476 , \u00a7\u00a7 1441-1443 (2000), makes it unlawful to import into, or export from, the United States any dog or cat fur product; or to engage in interstate commerce in any dog or cat fur product.\nDolphin Protection Consumer Information Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1385\nThis statute, as amended by \u00a7 5 of the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act, P.L. 105 - 42 (1997), makes it a violation of \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45,\nfor any producer, importer, exporter, distributor, or seller of any tuna product that is exported from or offered for sale in the United States to include on the label of that product the term \"dolphin safe\" or any other term or symbol that falsely claims or suggests that the tuna contained in the product were harvested using a method of fishing that is not harmful to dolphins if the product contains tuna harvested\u2014\n(A) on the high seas by a vessel engaged in driftnet fishing; or\n(B) outside the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by a vessel using purse seine nets ...\n(C) in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by a vessel using a purse seine net unless the tuna meet the requirements for being considered dolphin safe under paragraph (2). ...\nViolators are subject to a civil penalty of up to $100,000.\nDriftnet Impact Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act of 1987, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1822 note\nThis statute finds that \"the use of long plastic driftnets is a fishing technique that may result in the entanglement and death of enormous numbers of target and nontarget marine resources in the waters of the North Pacific Ocean, including the Bering Sea.\" It therefore provides that the Secretary of Commerce, through the Secretary of State, shall negotiate with foreign governments to monitor driftnet fishing, and shall evaluate the feasibility of various methods of reducing the number of driftnets discarded or lost at sea.\nThe Driftnet Act Amendments of 1990, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826, incorporate and expand upon provisions of the Driftnet Impact Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act of 1987.\nEastern Pacific Tuna Licensing Act of 1984, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 972-972h\nThis statute makes it unlawful to fish for designated species of tuna within the \"Area Agreement\" specified in the act without a license, or in contravention of regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Commerce.\nEndangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1531-1544\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary of Commerce in the case of marine mammals) to promulgate lists of species which are endangered or threatened (defined as \"likely to become ... endangered\") and to designate critical habitats of such species. Among other things, the act prohibits any person or private or governmental entity from importing, exporting, taking, possessing, selling, or transporting any endangered species. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1538. It prohibits federal agencies, unless granted an exemption, from taking action \"likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of [critical] habitat of such species.\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536(a)(2). (No similar prohibition applies to entities other than federal agencies.) The act also requires the Secretary to develop and implement recovery plans for the conservation and survival of endangered and threatened species. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01533(f).\nIn 1988, P.L. 100 - 478 amended the act to require the Secretary to develop and implement recovery plans for the conservation and survival of endangered species and threatened species, and to implement a system in cooperation with the states to monitor the status of recovered species. It also directed the Secretary of Commerce to contract for an independent review, by the National Academy of Sciences, of scientific information pertaining to the conservation of sea turtles.\nFair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604\nThis statute, as interpreted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), requires that all public and private housing (except as exempted in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3603(b) and \u00a7 3607) allow seeing eye dogs, even if they otherwise have a \"no pets\" policy. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.204. The act prohibits discrimination \"in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection\" with such a dwelling, because of a race, color, religion, sex, familial status (living with children), national origin, or handicap. One form of discrimination based on handicap is \"a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may to necessary to afford [a handicapped] person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\" HUD has determined that allowing seeing eye dogs is a reasonable accommodation.\nFederal Hazardous Substances Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1261-1275\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission, which administers this statute, adopted a policy statement on animal testing \"intended to minimize the number of animals tested and to reduce the pain associated with such tests.\" The statement notes \"that neither the FHSA nor the Commission's regulations require any firm to perform animal tests,\" although it adds that \"animal testing may be necessary in some cases.\" 49 Fed. Reg. 22522 (May 30, 1984).\nFederal Law Enforcement Animal Protection Act of 2000, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1368\nThis statute makes it a crime \"willfully and maliciously\" to harm a dog or horse used by a federal agency in law enforcement.\nFish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2901-2912\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to approve state conservation plans for \"nongame fish and wildlife,\" which are defined as \"wild vertebrate animals that are in an unconfined state and that\u2014(A) are not ordinarily taken for sport, fur, or food ...; (B) are not listed as endangered species or threatened species ... and (C) are not marine mammals. ...\" A 1988 amendment (adding 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 2912) requires the Secretary to undertake research and conservation activities concerning population trends of, and the effects of environmental changes and human activities on, \"migratory nongame birds.\"\nFish And Wildlife Coordination Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 661-667d\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of the Interior:\nto provide assistance to, and cooperate with, Federal, State, and public or private agencies and organizations in the development, protection, rearing, and stocking of all species of wildlife, resources thereof, and their habitat, and in controlling losses of the same from disease or other causes, in minimizing damages from overabundant species, in providing public shooting and fishing areas. ...\nFishery Conservation Amendments of 1990, P.L. 101-627\nIn addition to containing numerous amendments of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975, this statute includes the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act, which this report summarizes separately.\nFood, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 5801(a)(5)\nThis statute funds \"research designed to increase our knowledge concerning agricultural production systems that\" serve six specified purposes, one of which is to \"promote the well being of animals.\"\nFur Seal Act of 1966, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151-1175\nThis statute prohibits the \"taking\" (defined as to \"harass, hunt, capture, or kill\") of fur seals in the North Pacific Ocean or on any lands or waters under the jurisdiction of the United States, or to engage in commerce in fur seals' skins taken contrary to the act or the Interim Convention on the Conservation of North Pacific Fur Seals.\nThe act contains an exception allowing taking by \"Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos who dwell on the coasts of the North Pacific Ocean,\" and authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to permit taking for \"educational, scientific, or exhibition purposes.\" The act also directs the Secretary to administer the fur seal rookeries on the Pribilof Islands to \"ensure that activities on such Islands are consistent with the purposes of conserving, managing, and protecting the North Pacific fur seals and other wildlife. ...\" The 1983 amendments to the act repealed the Protection of Sea Otters on the High Seas Act, formerly 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1171-1172, as unnecessary because of the enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.\nGreat Ape Conservation Act of 2000, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6301-6305\nThis statute \"established in the Multinational Species Conservation Fund a separate account to be known as the 'Great Ape Conservation Fund.'\" The Secretary of the Interior shall use the fund for projects that he approves for the conservation of great apes.\nHigh Seas Fishing Compliance Act of 1995, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5501-5509\nThe purpose of this statute is \"(1) to implement the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas ... , and (2) to establish a system of permitting, reporting, and regulation for vessels of the United States fishing on the high seas.\"\nHorse Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821-1831\nThis statute makes it a crime to exhibit, or transport for the purpose of exhibition, any \"sore\" horse, which is a horse whose feet have been injured in order to alter the horse's gait.

Such waivers may be granted only \"if the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, determines that no horse in that consignment is being exported for purposes of slaughter.\"\nHumane Slaughter Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901-1906\nThe central provision of the Humane Slaughter Act (HSA) reads:\nNo method of slaughter or handling in connection with slaughtering shall be deemed to comply with the public policy of the United States unless it is humane. Either of the following two methods of slaughtering and handling are hereby found to be humane:\n(a) in the case of cattle, calves, horses, mules, sheep, swine, and other livestock, all animals are rendered insensible to pain by a single blow or gunshot or an electrical, chemical or other means that is rapid and effective, before being shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut; or\n(b) by slaughtering in accordance with the ritual requirements of the Jewish faith or any other religious faith that prescribes a method of slaughter whereby the animal suffers loss of consciousness by anemia of the brain caused by the simultaneous and instantaneous severance of the carotid arteries with a sharp instrument and handling in connection with such slaughtering.\nThe Humane Slaughter Act is enforced by the Secretary of Agriculture under provisions of the Federal Meat Inspection Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 603(b), 610(b), 620(a).

It also authorized the Secretary, based on the findings of the report, to promulgate regulations to provide for the humane treatment of such animals.\nICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 285l - 285l-6\nThis statute provides that the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) shall, among other things, \"[r]eview and evaluate new or revised or alternative test methods,\" and \"[f]acilitate appropriate interagency and international harmonization of acute or chronic toxicological test protocols that encourage the reduction, refinement, or replacement of animal test methods.\"\nThe ICCVAM was established by the Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences pursuant to section 463A(b) of the Public Health Services Act (NIEHS), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0285 l -1(b). The ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000 requires the Director of the NIEHS to designate the ICCVAM \"as a permanent interagency coordinating committee of the Institute [the NIEHS] under the National Toxicology Program Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods.\" The new act also provides that the ICCVAM shall be composed of the heads (or their designees) of 15 named federal agencies plus \"[a]ny other agency that develops, or employs tests or test data using animals, or regulates on the basis of the use of animals in toxicity testing.\"\nInternational Dolphin Conservation Act of 1992, P.L. 102-523\nThis statute amended the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950, and the South Pacific Tuna Act of 1988, all of which are discussed in this report.\nInternational Dolphin Conservation Program Act, P.L. 105-42 (1997)\nThis statute amended the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act, and the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950, all of which are discussed in this report.\nLacey Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 41-48 (see also Animal Enterprise Protection Act of 1992, and Depictions of Animal Cruelty)20\nThis statute makes it a crime to (1) willfully disturb or kill any bird, fish, or wild animal, or take or destroy the eggs or nest of any bird or fish, on any lands or waters set apart or reserved under federal law as sanctuaries, refuges, or breeding grounds for such birds, fish, or animals (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 41); (2) import species of wild animals, wild birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), amphibians, reptiles, or the offspring or eggs or any of the foregoing which the Secretary of the Interior prescribes by regulation to be injurious to human beings or to the interests of agriculture, horticulture, forestry, or wildlife, except that the Secretary may permit importation for zoological, education, medical, or scientific purposes (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a042); or (3) use an aircraft or a motor vehicle to hunt, or to pollute a watering hole of, any wild unbranded horse, mare, colt, or burro running at large on any public land or ranges (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 47). P.L. 110-161 , \u00a7 109, 121 Stat. 2119 (2007), contains an exception to this last provision. It permits the Secretary of the Interior to use \"helicopters or motor vehicles on the Sheldon and Hart National Wildlife Refuge for the purpose of capturing and transporting horses and burros,\" but \"[s]uch use shall be in accordance with humane procedures prescribed by the Secretary.\"\nLacey Act Amendments of 1981, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3371-3378\nThis statute, as amended in 1988, makes it unlawful to engage in commerce in any fish or wildlife or plant taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any treaty, or any federal or state law or regulation, or any Indian tribal law. This statute was amended by the Captive Wildlife Safety Act, P.L. 108 - 191 (2003), to cover \"prohibited wildlife species,\" which it defines as \"any live species of lion, tiger, leopard, cheetah, jaguar, or cougar or any hybrid of such species.\" The Captive Wildlife Safety Act, however, \"does not apply to any licensed, registered, and federally inspected exhibitor (zoos, circuses, etc.) or research facility. It also exempts sanctuaries, humane societies, animal shelters, or societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals that meet specified criteria.\"\nMagnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801-1891d\nThis statute, which was amended by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006, P.L. 109 - 479 , provides that, except with respect to highly migratory species of fish, \"the United States claims, and will exercise in the manner provided for in this act, sovereign rights and exclusive fishery management authority over all fish, and all Continental Shelf fishery resources. ...\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1811(a). See also, \"Shark Finning Prohibition Act.\"\nMarine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1361-1423h\nThis statute imposes a moratorium on the taking (\"take\" means \"harass, hunt, capture, or kill\") and importation of all marine mammals or their products, except that the Secretary of Commerce or Interior (depending on the type of animal) may grant permits to allow taking and importation (1) for scientific research and public display, (2) incidentally, in the course of commercial fishing, and (3) \"in accord with sound principles of resource protection and conservation.\" The act also makes it unlawful, except pursuant to a permit for scientific research, to import a marine mammal that is (1) pregnant, (2) nursing or less than eight months old, (3) taken from a species or population stock designated by the Secretary as depleted, or (4) taken in a manner deemed inhumane by the Secretary.\nThe act also establishes a Marine Mammal Commission whose duties include undertaking studies and making recommendations as to the protection and conservation of marine mammals. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401-1402.\nAn exception to the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to \"authorize the taking of not more than 25 marine mammals [not a member of an endangered or threatened species] each year for national defense purposes. Any such authorization may be made only with the concurrence of the Secretary of Commerce after consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission. ...\" 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7524.\nIn 1988, P.L. 100 - 711 added \"a number of provisions to the act for the specific purpose of reducing the morality [sic] of porpoise in the course of fishing for yellowfin tuna in the ETP [Eastern Tropical Pacific].\"\nIn 1992, Congress added two new laws to the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. P.L. 102 - 523 added the International Dolphin Conservation Act of 1992, \"to prohibit certain tuna harvesting practices.\" P.L. 102 - 587 , Title III, added the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Act, which directed the establishment of the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program, the purpose of which is to collect data on marine mammal health and to coordinate effective responses to unusual mortality events by establishing a process in the Department of Commerce.\nThe Marine Mammal Protection Act Amendments of 1994, P.L. 103 - 238 , was intended \"to improve the program to reduce the incidental taking of marine mammals during the course of commercial fishing operations, and for other purposes. ...\" S.Rept. 103-220, 103 rd Cong., 2 nd sess. (1994). The 1994 statute, among other things, amended 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1374 to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to issue permits \"for the importation of polar bear parts (other than internal organs) taken in sport hunts in Canada,\" but required the Secretary to \"undertake a scientific review of the impact of [such] permits ... on the polar bear population stocks in Canada within 2 years. ...\" 108 Stat. 539 (1994).\nThe 1994 statute also amended 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1374 to provide that the Secretary of Commerce may issue permits \"to take or import a marine mammal for the purpose of public display only to a person which the Secretary determines ... is registered or holds a license issued under\" the Animal Welfare Act. The effect of this provision apparently is that the Department of Agriculture rather than the National Marine Fisheries Service is authorized to regulate such marine mammals once they are held in captivity. 108 Stat. 537 (1994).\nIn 1997, the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act, P.L. 105 - 42 , amended various provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. In 2007, title IX of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006, P.L. 109 - 479 , added the United States-Russia Polar Bear Conservation and Management Act of 2006 to the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.\nMarine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987, P.L. 100-220, Title II\nThis statute amended the act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01901-1915, to, among other things, direct the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, to study \"improper disposal practices and associated specific plastic articles that occur in the environment with sufficient frequency to cause death or injury to fish or wildlife.\"\nMarine Protection, Research, And Sanctuaries Act of 1972, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1431-1445b\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to designate national marine sanctuaries.\nMarine Turtle Conservation Act of 2004, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6601-6607\nThis statute states that its purpose \"is to assist in the conservation of marine turtles and the nesting habitats of marine turtles in foreign countries by supporting and providing financial resources for projects to converse the nesting habitats, conserve marine turtles in those habitats, and address other threats to the survival of marine turtles.\"\nMigratory Bird Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 715-715s\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to purchase or rent such areas as have been approved for purchase or rental by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission \"which he determines to be suitable for use as an inviolate sanctuary, or for any other management purpose, for migratory birds.\"\nMultinational Species Conservation Fund, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246\nThis fund was created in 1998 to carry out the African Elephant Conservation Act, the Asian Elephant Conservation Act, and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act. Separate accounts in the fund were established as the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account, and the Great Ape Conservation Fund.\nNational Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3191-3202\nThis statute is designed to promote \"the improved health and productivity of domestic livestock, poultry, aquatic animals, and other income-producing animals that are essential to food supply of the United States and the welfare of producers and consumers of animal products.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 3191, as amended by P.L. 104 - 127 (1996), \u00a7 810. It was amended in 1990 to require the Secretary of Agriculture to commission the National Academy of Sciences \"to conduct a study of the delivery system utilized to provide farmers ... and ranchers with animal care and veterinary medical services, including animal drugs.\" The study shall assess opportunities to, among other things, \"advance the well-being and treatment of farm animals.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 3193.\nP.L. 104 - 127 (1996), \u00a7 812, amended 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 3196(c) to provide:\nIn order to establish a rational allocation of funds appropriated under this section, the Secretary shall establish annual priority lists of animal health and disease, food safety, and animal well-being problems of national or regional significance. ... In establishing such priorities, the Secretary, the Joint Council, the Advisory Board, and the Board shall consider the following factors: ... (3) issues of animal well-being related to production methods that will improve the housing and management of animals to improve the well-being of livestock production species.\nNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3701-3710\nThis statute created the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation as a nonprofit corporation to, among other things, \"encourage, accept and administer private gifts of property for the benefit of, or in connection with, the activities and services of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. ...\"\nNational Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701r-1\nA 1983 amendment to this statute prohibits owners or managers of federally assisted rental housing for the elderly or handicapped to (1) as a condition of tenancy or otherwise, prohibit, or prevent tenants from keeping \"common household pets,\" or (2) restrict or discriminate against any person in connection with admission to, or continued occupancy of, such housing by reason of the presence of such pets. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Secretary of Agriculture are authorized to issue regulations establishing guidelines under which housing owners or managers may prescribe reasonable rules for the keeping of pets, including restricting pet size and types of pets. Owners or managers may require the removal of pets \"duly determined\" to constitute a nuisance or a threat to health or safety.\nP.L. 105 - 276 , \u00a7 526 (1998), added a new \u00a7 31 to the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437z-3, which extended the right to keep common household pets to residents of all public housing, not only to residents of public housing designated for the elderly or handicapped. (The right to keep pets in federally assisted rental housing for the elderly or handicapped remains under the National Housing Act.) The new provision took effect August 9, 2000. 24 C.F.R. Part 960.\nNational Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 668dd-668ee\nThis statute established the National Wildlife Refuge System, which is administered by the Secretary of the Interior through the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The purpose of the System is to \"consolidat[e] the authorities relating to the various categories of areas that are administered by the Secretary of the Interior for the conservation of fish and wildlife. ...\"\nNeotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6101-6109\nThis statute \"established in the Multinational Species Conservation Fund of the Treasury a separate account to be known as the 'Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account.'\" The fund is to be used for a program, established by the Secretary of the Interior, \"to provide financial assistance for projects to promote the conservation of neotropical migratory birds.\"\nNonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4701-4751\nThis statute is intended \"to prevent unintentional introduction and dispersal of nonindigenous species into waters of the United States through ballast water management and other requirements.\" The statute finds that nonindigenous species, such as the zebra mussel, if left uncontrolled, would disrupt the economy and \"the diversity and abundance of native fish.\"\nNorth Pacific Anadromous Stocks Act of 1992, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5001-5012\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to enforce the Convention for the Conservation of Anadromous Stocks in the North Pacific Ocean.\nNorthern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 773-773k\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to enforce the Convention between the United States of America and Canada for the preservation of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea.\nNorthwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention Act of 1995, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5601-5612\nThis statute implements the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention.\nPacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3631-3645\nThis statute implements a treaty between the United States and Canada, the purposes of which were to \"prevent overfishing and provide for optimum production\" and to \"provide for each Party to receive benefits equivalent to the production of salmon originating in its waters.\" The act repealed the Sockeye Salmon or Pink Salmon Fishing Act of 1947, formerly 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 776-776f.\nPacific Whiting Act of 2006, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7001-7010\nThis statute requires the Secretary of Commerce to\nestablish the United States catch level for Pacific whiting according to the standards and procedures of the Agreement [between the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada on Pacific Hake/Whiting] and this [statute] ... rather than under the standards and procedures of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), except to the extent necessary to address the rebuilding needs of other species.\nPartnerships for Wildlife Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3741-3744\n\"The purposes of this title are to establish a partnership among the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, designated State agencies, and private organizations and individuals\u2014(1) to carry out wildlife conservation and appreciation projects. ...\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.\nPets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5170b(a)(3)(J), 5196(e)(4), 5196(j)(2), 5196b(g)\nThis statute ( P.L. 109 - 308 ) amended the Robert T. Stafford Disaster and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize federal disaster assistance in the \"rescue, care, shelter, and essential needs\" of \"household pets and service animals\"; to authorize the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop \"plans that take into account the needs of individuals with pets and service animals prior to, during, and following a major disaster or emergency\"; to authorize the Director of FEMA to \"make financial contributions ... to the States and local authorities for animal emergency preparedness purposes, including the procurement, construction, leasing, or renovating of emergency shelter facilities ...\"; and to require the Director of FEMA, \"[i]n approving standards for State and local emergency preparedness operational plans ... , [to] ensure that such plans take into account the needs of individuals with household pets and service animals prior to, during, and following a major disaster or emergency.\"\nPittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 669-669k\nAlso known as the \"Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act,\" this statute authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to cooperate with the states, through their respective fish and game departments, in wildlife restoration projects, which are defined as the \"selection, restoration, rehabilitation, and improvement of areas of land or water adaptable as feeding, resting, or breeding places for wildlife.\" This statute was amended by the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000, discussed below.\nPublic Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 283e, 289d\nSection 404C of this statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 283e, directs the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), by October 1, 1993, to prepare a plan for the NIH to conduct or support research into methods of biomedical research and experimentation that do not require the use of animals, that reduce the number of animals used, that produce less pain and distress in animals used, and that involve the use of marine life other than marine mammals.\nSection 495 of this statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 289d, directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the NIH, to establish guidelines for research facilities as to the proper care and treatment of animals, including the appropriate use of tranquilizers, analgesics, and the like; but such guidelines may not prescribe methods of research. Entities that conduct biomedical and behavioral research with NIH funds must establish animal care committees which must conduct reviews at least semi-annually and report to the Director of NIH at least annually. If the Director determines that an entity has not been following the guidelines, he must give it an opportunity to take corrective action, and, if it does not, suspend or revoke its grant or contract.\nRecreational Hunting Safety and Preservation Act of 1994, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5201-5207\nThis statute makes it a violation, subject to a civil penalty of up to $10,000, \"intentionally to engage in any physical conduct that significantly hinders a lawful hunt ... on Federal lands.\" The conference report states that, to be a violation, \"the conduct must be intentional, and must be done with the intention of significantly hindering a lawful hunt.\" The statute also authorizes injunctive relief against violations.\nThe conference report gives examples of violations of the statute, including \"using visual, aural, olfactory, or physical stimuli to affect wildlife behavior.\" Ibid. This suggests the possibility that a court could construe mere words addressed to a hunter as \"physical conduct,\" if such words affected wildlife behavior (or a hunter's concentration) so as significantly to hinder a hunt. This apparently would not violate the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech, provided that the statute's civil penalty were imposed on the speaker for the effect of the sound of his words and not for their content. The statute states that \"[t]he term 'conduct' does not include speech protected by the first article of amendment to the Constitution\" (the statute does not otherwise define \"conduct\" or \"physical conduct\"), but this of course would go without saying, as Congress cannot punish speech that is protected by the First Amendment.\nRehabilitation Act of 1973: See Americans with Disabilities Act\nRhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5301-5306\nThis statute created the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Fund \"to provide financial assistance for projects for the conservation of rhinoceros and tigers.\"\nSalmon and Steelhead Conservation and Enhancement Act of 1980, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3345\nThis statute authorizes the establishment of a cooperative program involving the United States, the States of Washington and Oregon, and Indian Tribes, to \"encourage stability in and promote the economic well being\" of commercial fishing through \"coordinated research, enhancement, and management of salmon and steelhead resources and habitat.\"\nShark Finning Prohibition Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1822 note\nThis statute amended the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act by adding 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857(1)(P) to make it unlawful \"to remove any of the fins of a shark (including the tail) and discard the carcass of the shark at sea.\" It also requires the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Secretary of State, to, among other things, \"initiate discussions as soon as possible for the purpose of developing bilateral or multilateral agreements with other nations for the prohibition of shark-finning.\"\nSikes Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 670a-670o\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of Defense\nto carry out a program of planning for, and the development, maintenance and coordination of, wildlife, fish, and game conservation and rehabilitation in each military reservation in accordance with a cooperative plan mutually agreed upon by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Interior, and the appropriate State agency designated by the State in which the reservation is located.\nSouth Pacific Tuna Act of 1988, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 973-973r\nThis statute implements the Treaty on Fisheries Between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States, signed April 2, 1987.\nTariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1527\nThis section of the Tariff Act of 1930 (also known as the \"Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act\" and the \"Smoot-Hawley Act\") prohibits the importation into the United States of any wild mammal or bird, alive or dead, or any part of product of any wild mammal or bird, if the laws or regulations of the country where the wild mammal or bird lives restrict its \"taking, killing, possession, or exportation to the United States,\" unless the wild mammal or bird is accompanied by a certification of the U.S. consul that it \"has not been acquired or exported in violation of the laws of regulations of such country. ...\"\nAny mammal or bird, alive or dead, or any part of product thereof, imported into the U.S. in violation of the above shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture under the customs laws. The Tariff Act of 1930 does not apply in the case of (1) articles the importation of which is prohibited by any other law, including 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a042(a) (the Lacey Act), (2) articles imported for scientific or educational purposes, or are migratory, or (3) certain migratory game birds.\nTuna Conventions Act of 1950, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 951-962\nThis statute prohibits fishing in violation of any regulation adopted by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to the Convention for the Establishment of an Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, and prohibits commerce in fish taken in violation of such regulations.\nTwenty-Eight Hour Law, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 80502\nPrior versions of this law were enacted in 1873 (Ch. 252, 42d Cong., 17 Stat. 584, R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4386-4389) and 1906 (Ch. 3594, 59 th Cong., 34 Stat. 607). The 1906 law was repealed and reenacted in amended form (but \"without substantive change\" ) in 1994 by P.L. 103 - 272 . (It was previously codified at 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a071-74.) It is also known as the \"Cruelty to Animals Act,\" the \"Live Stock Transportation Act,\" and the \"Food and Rest Law.\" As amended in 1994, it provides that \"a rail carrier, express carrier, or common carrier (except by air or water), a receiver, trustee, or lessee of one of those carriers, or an owner or master of a vessel transporting animals\" across state lines, \"may not confine animals in a vehicle or vessel for more than 28 consecutive hours without unloading the animals for feeding, water, and rest.\"\nIt also provides that \"[a]nimals being transported shall be unloaded in a humane way into pens equipped for feeding, water, and rest for at least 5 consecutive hours.\" The statute \"does not apply when animals are transported in a vehicle or vessel in which the animals have food, water, space, and an opportunity for rest.\"\nThe 28-hour period is subject to the following exceptions:\nSheep may be confined for an additional 8 consecutive hours without being unloaded when the 28-hour period of confinement ends at night. Animals may be confined for\u2014(A) more than 28 hours when the animals cannot be unloaded because of accidental or unavoidable causes that could not have been anticipated or avoided when being careful; and (B) 36 consecutive hours when the owner or person having custody of animals being transported requests, in writing and separate from a bill of lading or other rail form, that the 28-hour period be extended to 36 hours.\nThe Twenty-Eight Hour Law is enforced by the Attorney General, who, \"[o]n learning of a violation ... shall bring a civil action\" to collect a penalty of at least $100 but not more than $500 for each violation. The statute does not provide for criminal penalties. The statute does not mention any federal agency or official besides the Attorney General, but its 1906 version provided, \"It shall be the duty of all U.S. Attorneys to prosecute all violations of this Act reported by the Secretary of Agriculture,\" and, as noted above, the 1994 amendment was intended to be \"without substantive change\" to the 1906 version. In addition, in 1963, the USDA issued regulations under the act that remain in effect. 9 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 89.1-89.5. Therefore, it appears that the USDA continues to play a role in enforcing the act.\nIn 2006, noting \"that the plain meaning of the statutory term 'vehicle' in the Twenty-Eight Hour Law includes 'trucks' which operate as express carriers or common carriers,\" the USDA decided for the first time to interpret the act to include the transportation of animals by trucks. In the same document in which it announced this decision, the USDA noted: \"The Twenty-Eight Hour Law was never construed as being applicable to poultry, and ... USDA does not intend to change this longstanding interpretation of the statute.\"\nUnited States Housing Act of 1937: See National Housing Act\nUnited States-Russia Polar Bear Conservation and Management Act of 2006, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1423-1423h\nThis statute, which is part of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, makes it unlawful \"to take any polar bear in violation of the Agreement [Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation on the Conservation and Management of the Alaska-Chukotka Polar Bear Population].\" It also makes it unlawful \"to import, export, possess, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase, exchange, [or] barter ... any polar bear, or any part or product of a polar bear, that is taken in violation of\" the agreement or other restriction that is adopted by the commission established under the agreement. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to enforce the act.\nWendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41721\nThis statute, enacted April 5, 2000, requires air carriers that provide scheduled passenger air transportation to submit monthly reports to the Secretary of Transportation on any incidents involving the loss, injury, or death of an animal. The statute requires the Secretary to publish this data in a manner comparable to other consumer complaint and incident data.\nWestern and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention Implementation Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6901-6910\nThis statute provides for the representation of the United States on the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean.\nWhale Conservation And Protection Study Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 917-917d\nThis statute directs the Secretary of Commerce to \"undertake comprehensive studies of all whales found in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\"\nWhaling Convention Act of 1949, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 916-916l\nThis statute prohibits whaling and commerce in whale products in violation of the International Whaling Convention for the Regulation of Whaling or in violation of any regulation of the International Whaling Commission or the Secretary of Commerce.\nWild Bird Conservation Act of 1992, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4901-4916\nThe purpose of this act is to promote the conservation of exotic birds by assisting wild bird conservation and management programs in the countries of origin of wild birds, and limiting the importation of exotic birds.\nWild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331-1340\nThis statute makes it a crime, with respect to any wild free-roaming horse or burro, to (1) remove it from the public lands without authority from the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture (depending on the public land), (2) convert it to private use, without authority from the Secretary, (3) maliciously cause its death or harassment, (4) process its remains into commercial products, or (5) sell it if it is maintained on private or leased land.\nWildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 669-669k\nThis statute amends the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act to authorize firearm and bow hunter education and safety program grants, and to establish a multistate conservation grant program. Grants under the latter may not be used \"for an activity, project, or program that promotes or encourages opposition to the regulated hunting or trapping of wildlife\" (\u00a7 113).\nThis statute also amends the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act to establish a multistate conservation grant program, grants under which may not be used \"for an activity, project, or program that promotes or encourages opposition to the regulated taking of fish\" (\u00a7 122).\nYukon River Salmon Act of 1995, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5701-5709\nThis statute implements \"the interim agreement for the conservation of salmon stocks originating from the Yukon River in Canada. ...\" \n\n[Requirement] Your summary must be {word_count_type} {word_count} words long.", "raw_data": " \nAdoption of Military Animals, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2583\nThis statute provides, in part: \"The Secretary of the military department concerned may make a military animal of such military department available for adoption ... under circumstances as follows: (1) At the end of the animal's useful life. (2) Before the end of the animal's useful life, if such Secretary ... determines that unusual or extraordinary circumstances justify [it]. (3) When the animal is otherwise excess to the needs of such military department.\" The statute defines \"military animal\" as \"[a] military working dog\" or \"[a] horse owned by the Department of Defense.\" When this statute was first enacted in 2000, it applied only to military working dogs; prior to then, under Department of Defense policy, such dogs were caged, sometimes for as long as a year, and then euthanized. See 146 Cong. Rec. H 9599 (daily ed. October 10, 2000). The statute was amended to cover horses in 2006.\nAfrican Elephant Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4201-4245\nThis statute establishes an African Elephant Conservation Fund, from which the Secretary of the Interior may provide financial assistance \"for approved projects for research, conservation, management, or protection of African elephants.\" It requires the Secretary to establish a moratorium on the importation of raw and worked ivory from an ivory producing country that does not meet specified criteria, including being a party to CITES and adhering to the CITES Ivory Control System. (\"CITES\" is the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.)\nThe act imposes civil and criminal penalties on any person who, among other things, imports raw ivory from any country other than an ivory producing country, or from a country for which a moratorium is in effect, or who exports raw ivory from the United States. A person who furnishes information that leads to a civil penalty or a criminal conviction under the act may be rewarded up to one-half of any criminal or civil penalty or fine, or $25,000, whichever is less.\nAgriculture Appropriations Act, 2006, P.L. 109-97 (2005), and subsequent appropriations acts\nSection 794 of P.L. 109-97 (2005) provides:\nEffective 120 days after the date of enactment of this act, none of the funds made available by this act may be used to pay the salaries or expenses of personnel to inspect horses under section 3 of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 603) or under guidelines issued under section 903 [of] the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 1901 note; P.L. 104-127 ).\nBecause the Federal Meat Inspection Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 603, requires horses (and specified other mammals) to be inspected before they may be slaughtered for human consumption, \u00a7 794 of P.L. 109-97 , by precluding appropriated funds from being used to pay inspectors' salaries and expenses to inspect horses, would have effectively prohibited the slaughter of horses for human consumption from March 10, 2006, until September 30, 2006. The Department of Agriculture, however, on February 8, 2006, issued a regulation allowing slaughter plants to pay for inspections by the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service so that horses could continue to be slaughtered for human consumption. 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 352.19.\nThe 110 th Congress prevented the Department of Agriculture from continuing to charge slaughter plants for inspections, and it thereby effectively prohibited the slaughter of horses for human consumption. It accomplished this by prohibiting appropriated funds from being used not only, as in P.L. 109-97 , to pay salaries and expenses under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, but also from being used to implement or enforce 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 352.19, under which the Department of Agriculture allowed slaughter plants to pay for inspections. P.L. 110-161 , \u00a7 741, 121 Stat. 1881 (2007); P.L. 110-329 , Div. A, \u00a7 101, 122 Stat. 3574-3575 (2008) (incorporating provisions of P.L. 110-161 ).\nAirborne Hunting Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 742j-1\nThis statute makes it a crime (1) while in an aircraft, to shoot any bird, fish, or other animal, or (2) to use an aircraft to harass any bird, fish, or other animal. These prohibitions do not apply to persons employed by or licensed by a state or the federal government to administer or protect \"land, water, wildlife, domesticated animals, human life, or crops.\"\nAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act\nSections 1313-1314 of this act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3201-3202, authorize the Secretary of the Interior to designate zones within national preserves in Alaska \"where and when no hunting, fishing, trapping, or entry may be permitted,\" and prohibits \"the taking of fish and wildlife\" in national parks or national park system monuments in Alaska, except as specified in the act.\nSection 1005 of the act, as amended in 1990, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145, provides that the Secretary of the Interior\nshall work closely with the State of Alaska and Native Village and Regional Corporations in evaluating the impact of oil and gas exploration, development, production, and transportation and other human activities on the wildlife resources of these lands, including impacts on the Arctic and Porcupine caribou herds, polar bears, muskox, grizzly bear, wolf, wolverine, seabirds, shorebirds, and migratory waterfowl.\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213\nThis statute (together with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0791-794) prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, public services, and public accommodations. Discrimination includes refusing to make reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, and a reasonable accommodation generally includes permitting the use of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.302(c). See also, \" Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604 ,\" discussed below.\nAnadromous Fish Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 757a-757f\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to take various actions for the protection of fishery resources.\nAnimal Damage Control Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 426-426c\nThis statute directs the Secretary of Agriculture:\nto conduct investigations, experiments, and tests as he may deem necessary in order to determine, demonstrate, and promulgate the best methods of eradication, suppression, or bringing under control on national forests and other areas of the public domain as well as on State, Territory, or privately owned lands of mountain lions, wolves, bobcats, prairie dogs, gophers, ground squirrels, jack rabbits, brown tree snakes, and other animals injurious to agriculture, horticulture, forestry, animal husbandry, wild game animals, fur-bearing animals, and birds.\nThis statute was enacted in 1931 (though \"brown tree snakes\" were added in 1991). The functions of the Secretary of Agriculture under it were transferred to the Secretary of Interior in 1939, and back to Agriculture in 1985. In 1987, P.L. 100 - 202 , 101 Stat. 1329-331, added the following provision to the act:\nThe Secretary of Agriculture is authorized, except for urban rodent control, to conduct activities and enter into agreements with States, local jurisdictions, individuals, and public and private agencies, organizations, and institutions in the control of nuisance mammals and birds and those mammal and bird species that are reservoirs for zoonotic diseases, and to deposit any money collected under any such agreement into the appropriation accounts that incur the costs to be available immediately and to remain available until expended for Animal Damage Control activities.\nAnimal Disease Risk Assessment, Prevention, and Control Act of 2001, P.L. 107-9 (2001)\nThis statute requires the Department of Agriculture to submit to the House and Senate agriculture committees a preliminary report by June 23, 2001, and a final report by October 20, 2001, concerning foot-and-mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases.\nAnimal Enterprise Terrorism Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 43\nThis statute, which replaced the Animal Enterprise Protection Act of 1992, makes it a crime to \"travel[ ] in interstate or foreign commerce, or use[ ] ... the mail or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce\u2014(1) for the purpose of damaging or interfering with the operations of an animal enterprise; and (2) in connection with such purpose\u2014(A) intentionally damag[ing] or caus[ing] the loss of any real or personal property ... [or] (B) intentionally plac[ing] a person in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to that person, a member of the immediate family ... of that person, or a spouse or intimate partner of that person. ...\" The statute defines \"animal enterprise\" as:\n(A) a commercial or academic enterprise that uses or sells animals or animal products for profit, food or fiber production, agriculture, education, research, or testing;\n(B) a zoo, aquarium, animal shelter, pet store, breeder, furrier, circus, rodeo, or other lawful competitive animal event; or\n(C) any fair or similar event intended to advance agricultural arts and sciences.\nAnimal Health Protection Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8301-8321\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, if he determines it to be necessary to prevent the introduction into or dissemination with the United States of any pest or disease of livestock, to prohibit or restrict, among other things, the importation or exportation of any animal into or from the United States, the movement in interstate commerce of any animal, or the use of any means of conveyance in connection with the importation or entry of livestock. The statute also authorizes the Secretary, if it is necessary for the above purpose, to order the destruction or removal from the United States of any animal, or to seize, quarantine, or dispose of any animal.\nAnimal Welfare Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2131-2159\nThe AWA authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to \"promulgate standards to govern the humane handling, care, treatment, and transportation of animals by dealers, research facilities, and exhibitors.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2143(a)(1). Such standards must include requirements \"for animal care, treatment, and practices in experimental procedures to ensure that animal pain and distress are minimized. ...\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02143(a)(3)(A). The act also requires the Secretary to \"promulgate standards to govern the transportation in commerce, and the handling, care, and treatment in connection therewith, by intermediate handlers, air carriers, or other carriers, of animals consigned by any ... person ... for transportation in commerce.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02143(a)(4).\nThe AWA's definition of \"animal\" makes the act applicable to any warmblooded animal used \"for research, testing, experimentation, or exhibition purposes, or as a pet; but such term excludes (1) birds, rats of the genus Rattus, and mice of the genus Mus, bred for use in research, (2) horses not used for research purposes, and (3) other farm animals. ...\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02132(g). Prior to this provision's amendment by P.L. 107 - 171 (2002), \u00a7\u00a010301, it did not exclude birds, rats, or mice. Nevertheless, the Secretary had promulgated regulations that excluded birds, and rats and mice bred for use in research, from coverage under the act. A federal court found this exclusion to violate the act, but the decision was overturned on appeal on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit. Subsequently, in a case unrelated to the birds, rats, and mice question, the en banc D.C. Circuit held that a plaintiff who \"suffered [injuries] to his aesthetic interest in observing animals living under humane conditions\" had standing to sue the Secretary of Agriculture to enforce the act.\nSubsequently, another suit was brought to challenge the exclusion of birds, rats, and mice, and a federal district court, citing the D.C. Circuit case, denied the Department of Agriculture's motion to dismiss for lack of standing. As a result, the Department of Agriculture settled the case by agreeing to revise its regulations to include birds, rats, and mice. Then Congress intervened, and, in the Department of Agriculture appropriations for FY2001 ( P.L. 106 - 387 , \u00a7\u00a0772), prohibited FY2001 funds from being used to \"modify the definition of 'animal' in existing regulations pursuant to the Animal Welfare Act.\" The FY2002 appropriations contained the same prohibition ( P.L. 107 - 76 , \u00a7\u00a0732), and then P.L. 107 - 171 , \u00a7\u00a010301, amended the statute to exclude birds, rats, and mice bred for research. Section 10304 of the statute, however, directs the National Research Council, by May 13, 2003, to submit to the House and Senate Agriculture Committees \"a report on the implications of including rats, mice, and birds within the definition of animal under the regulations promulgated under the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq.).\" No report appears to have been written.\nThe AWA requires every research facility to establish an Institutional Animal Committee of at least three members, at least one of whom shall not be affiliated in any way with the facility and who is intended to represent \"general community interests in the proper care and treatment of animals.\" The Committee's responsibilities include to review practices involving pain to animals and to file a report with the Secretary. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2143(b).\nThe AWA also provides for the licensing of dealers and exhibitors (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02133) and prohibits research facilities from purchasing dogs or cats from unlicensed dealers or exhibitors (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02137). The act defines \"dealer\" in part as a person who, for compensation, transports, buys, or sells any animal \"for research, teaching, exhibition, or use as a pet,\" but it excludes from the definition a retail pet store that does not sell \"animals to a research facility, an exhibitor, or a dealer\" (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2132(f)). The act defines \"exhibitor\" to include carnivals, circuses, and zoos, but to exclude retail pet stores, state and country fairs, livestock shows, rodeos, and purebred dog and cat shows (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2132(h)).\nThe AWA also prohibits dealers and exhibitors from selling or otherwise disposing of any dog or cat within five business days after they acquire it, except that this requirement does not apply to operators of auction sales. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2135. A 1990 amendment requires public and private pounds and shelters, and research facilities licensed by the Department of Agriculture, to \"hold and care for\" any dog or cat they acquire \"for a period of not less than five days to enable such dog or cat to be recovered by its original owner or adopted by other individuals before such entity sells such dog or cat to a dealer.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2158(a). Does this provision prohibit a pound, shelter, or research facility from euthanizing a dog or cat before five days? Perhaps not on its face, but that appears to be its intent, as to read it otherwise would seem to defeat its purpose.\nAnother 1990 amendment authorized the Attorney General to seek, and federal courts to issue, injunctions against dealing in stolen animals or placing the health of an animal in serious danger in violation of the act. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2159.\nP.L. 110 - 234 , \u00a7 14210 (2008) added a new section to the AWA (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02148) that prohibits any person from importing a dog into the United States for purposes of resale unless the Secretary determines that the dog is in good health, has received all necessary vaccinations, and is at least six months old. This section does not apply, however, if a dog is imported for research purposes or veterinary treatment, or if it is imported into Hawaii from the British Isles, Australia, Guam, or New Zealand, if the dog is not transported out of Hawaii for purposes of resale at less than six months of age. P.L. 110 - 234 , \u00a7 14214, also amended the AWA (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02149(b)) to increase, from $2,500 to $10,000, the civil penalty that the Secretary of Agriculture may assess for any violation of any provision of the act, or of any rule, regulation, or standard promulgated by the Secretary.\nAnimal Fighting, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2156, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 49\nThe Animal Welfare Act, as amended, most recently by P.L. 110 - 234 , \u00a7 14207 (2008) prohibits any person \"to knowingly sponsor or exhibit an animal in an animal fighting venture,\" or \"to knowingly sell, buy, possess, train, transport, deliver, or receive any animal for the purposes of having the animal participate in an animal fighting venture.\" However,\n[w]ith respect to fighting ventures involving live birds in a State where it would not be a violation of the law, it shall be unlawful under this subsection for a person to sponsor or exhibit a bird in a fighting venture only if the person knew that any bird in the fighting venture was knowingly bought, sold, delivered, transported, or received in interstate commerce for the purpose of participation in the fighting venture.\nOn August 15, 2008, a Louisiana statute (14:102.23) took effect that made it the 50 th state (plus the District of Columbia) to outlaw cockfighting, thereby essentially rendering moot this exception in the AWA.\nP.L. 110 - 22 (2007) made it \"unlawful for any person to knowingly sell, buy, transport, or deliver in interstate or foreign commerce a knife, a gaff, or any other sharp instrument attached, or designed or intended to be attached, to the leg of a bird for use in an animal fighting venture.\" P.L. 110 - 22 also increased the penalty for violations of the animal fighting ventures section from a misdemeanor to a felony, with a maximum penalty of a fine and three years' imprisonment per violation. P.L. 110-234 , \u00a7 14207(b) (2008) then increased the maximum penalty to a fine and five years' imprisonment per violation.\nThe animal fighting section of the AWA also prohibits knowingly using the mail or any instrumentality of interstate commerce to advertise an animal, or a sharp instrument, for use in an animal fighting venture, or to promote or further an animal fighting venture, except that this prohibition applies \"to fighting ventures involving live birds only if the fight is to take place in a State where it would be in violation of the laws thereof.\"\nAntarctic Conservation Act of 1978, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401-2412\nThis statute makes it unlawful for any United States citizen, unless authorized by the Director of the National Science Foundation, to engage in commerce in any native animal or native bird taken in Antarctica.\nAntarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act of 1984, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2431-2444\nThis statute implements the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, and makes it unlawful to harvest, or knowingly to engage in commerce in any Antarctic marine living resource harvested in violation of the Convention.\nAsian Elephant Conservation Act of 1997, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4261-4266\nThis statute establishes the Asian Elephant Conservation Fund and directs the Secretary of the Interior to use amounts in the Fund for projects for the conservation of Asian elephants.\nAtlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5101-5108\nThe statute requires the Secretary of Commerce, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, to develop and implement a program to support the interstate fishery management efforts of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.\nAtlantic Salmon Convention Act of 1982, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3601-3608\nThis statute limits salmon fishing pursuant to the Convention for the Conservation of Salmon in the North Atlantic Ocean.\nAtlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5151-5158\nThis statute directs the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior to jointly declare a moratorium on fishing for Atlantic striped bass within the coastal waters of any state that does not comply with the plan for managing Atlantic striped bass that is adopted by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.\nAtlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 971-971k\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to promulgate regulations to \"limit the size of the fish and the quantity of the catch which may be taken from each area ... [and] limit or prohibit the incidental catch of a regulated species. ...\"\nBald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 668-668d\nThis statute makes it a crime to possess, buy, sell, or transport any bald or golden eagle, alive or dead, or any part, nest, or egg thereof. The Secretary of the Interior may issue regulations authorizing exceptions \"for the scientific or exhibition purposes of public museums, scientific societies, and zoological parks, or for the religious purposes of Indian tribes, or ... for the protection of wildlife or of agricultural or other interests in any particular locality. ...\"\nCaptive Wildlife Safety Act: See Lacey Act Amendments of 1981\nChimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance, and Protection Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 287a-3a\nThe CHIMP Act, P.L. 106 - 551 (2000), as amended by P.L. 110 - 170 (2007), added \u00a7 481C to the Public Health Service Act. It requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to \"provide for the establishment and operation ... of a [sanctuary] system to provide for the lifetime care of chimpanzees that have been used, or were bred or purchased for use, in research conducted or supported by the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, or other agencies of the Federal Government,\" when such \"surplus chimpanzees\" are not needed for such research. Non-federal chimpanzees may also be accepted into the system. Chimpanzees in the system may not be used in research except as specified in the statute, and must be cared for in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act.\nThe sanctuary system shall be operated by a nonprofit private entity under a contract awarded by the Secretary of HHS. The nonprofit private entity shall have a board of directors composed of not more than 13 voting members, who shall include individuals with expertise and experience in various fields, including primate veterinary care, animal protection, behavioral primatology, management of nonprofit organizations, laboratory animal medicine, and biohazards.\nCommercial Transportation of Equine for Slaughter, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 note\nThis statute, enacted as part of P.L. 104-127 , 110 Stat. 1184 (1996), provides that \"the Secretary of Agriculture may issue guidelines for the regulation of the commercial transportation of equine for slaughter by persons regularly engaged in that activity within the United States.\" Specifically, \"the Secretary of Agriculture shall review the food, water, and rest provided to equine for slaughter in transit, the segregation of stallions from other equine during transit, and such other issues as the Secretary considers appropriate.\" The Secretary's regulations implementing this statute were issued in 2001 and are published at 9 C.F.R. Part 88.\nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Acts\nP.L. 101 - 511 , \u00a7 8019 (1990) provides:\nNone of the funds appropriated by this Act or hereafter shall be used to purchase dogs or cats or otherwise fund the use of dogs or cats for the purpose of training Department of Defense students or other personnel in surgical or other medical treatment of wounds produced by any type of weapon: Provided , That the standards of such training with respect to the treatment of animals shall adhere to the Federal Animal Welfare Law and to those prevailing in the civilian medical community.\nThis provision, without the words \"or hereafter,\" had been included in Department of Defense appropriations statutes since P.L. 98 - 212 , \u00a7 791 (1984). However, because of the words \"or hereafter\" in the language quoted above, this prohibition on the use of funds continues to operate unless it is repealed.\nOther Department of Defense appropriations statutes use the phrase \"this Act or any other Act\" instead of \"this Act or hereafter.\" The Comptroller General has \"held that the words 'or any other act' do not indicate futurity, but merely extend the effect of the provisions to other appropriations available in that fiscal year.\" 65 Comp. Gen. 588, 589 (1986). The following example of the use of this phrase in connection with the use of animals in research appeared in P.L. 103 - 139 , \u00a7\u00a08044 (1993), and P.L. 104 - 61 , \u00a7 8034 (1995):\nNone of the funds provided in this Act or any other Act shall be available to conduct bone trauma research at any Army Research Laboratory until the Secretary of the Army certifies that the synthetic compound to be used in the experiments is of such a type that its use will result in a significant medical finding, the research has military application, the research will be conducted in accordance with the standards set by an animal care and use committee, and the research does not duplicate research already conducted by a manufacturer or any other research organization.\nFinally, some limitations on the use of Department of Defense funds for animal research have applied only to a particular appropriations statute. For example, P.L. 103 - 139 \u00a7 8043 (1993), and P.L. 104 - 61 , \u00a7 8032 (1995), provide:\nNone of the funds appropriated by this Act shall be available for payments under the Department of Defense contract with the Louisiana State University Medical Center involving the use of cats for Brain Missile Wound Research. ...\nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for the Fiscal Year Ending September 30, 1993\nP.L. 102 - 394 , \u00a7 213 (1992) provides:\nNo funds appropriated under this Act or subsequent Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts shall be used by the National Institutes of Health, or any other Federal agency, or recipient of Federal funds on any project that entails the capture or procurement of chimpanzees obtained from the wild.

The purpose of the System is to \"consolidat[e] the authorities relating to the various categories of areas that are administered by the Secretary of the Interior for the conservation of fish and wildlife. ...\"\nNeotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6101-6109\nThis statute \"established in the Multinational Species Conservation Fund of the Treasury a separate account to be known as the 'Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account.'\" The fund is to be used for a program, established by the Secretary of the Interior, \"to provide financial assistance for projects to promote the conservation of neotropical migratory birds.\"\nNonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4701-4751\nThis statute is intended \"to prevent unintentional introduction and dispersal of nonindigenous species into waters of the United States through ballast water management and other requirements.\" The statute finds that nonindigenous species, such as the zebra mussel, if left uncontrolled, would disrupt the economy and \"the diversity and abundance of native fish.\"\nNorth Pacific Anadromous Stocks Act of 1992, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5001-5012\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to enforce the Convention for the Conservation of Anadromous Stocks in the North Pacific Ocean.\nNorthern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 773-773k\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to enforce the Convention between the United States of America and Canada for the preservation of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea.\nNorthwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention Act of 1995, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5601-5612\nThis statute implements the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention.\nPacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3631-3645\nThis statute implements a treaty between the United States and Canada, the purposes of which were to \"prevent overfishing and provide for optimum production\" and to \"provide for each Party to receive benefits equivalent to the production of salmon originating in its waters.\" The act repealed the Sockeye Salmon or Pink Salmon Fishing Act of 1947, formerly 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 776-776f.\nPacific Whiting Act of 2006, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7001-7010\nThis statute requires the Secretary of Commerce to\nestablish the United States catch level for Pacific whiting according to the standards and procedures of the Agreement [between the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada on Pacific Hake/Whiting] and this [statute] ... rather than under the standards and procedures of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), except to the extent necessary to address the rebuilding needs of other species.\nPartnerships for Wildlife Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3741-3744\n\"The purposes of this title are to establish a partnership among the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, designated State agencies, and private organizations and individuals\u2014(1) to carry out wildlife conservation and appreciation projects. ...\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.\nPets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5170b(a)(3)(J), 5196(e)(4), 5196(j)(2), 5196b(g)\nThis statute ( P.L. 109 - 308 ) amended the Robert T. Stafford Disaster and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize federal disaster assistance in the \"rescue, care, shelter, and essential needs\" of \"household pets and service animals\"; to authorize the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop \"plans that take into account the needs of individuals with pets and service animals prior to, during, and following a major disaster or emergency\"; to authorize the Director of FEMA to \"make financial contributions ... to the States and local authorities for animal emergency preparedness purposes, including the procurement, construction, leasing, or renovating of emergency shelter facilities ...\"; and to require the Director of FEMA, \"[i]n approving standards for State and local emergency preparedness operational plans ... , [to] ensure that such plans take into account the needs of individuals with household pets and service animals prior to, during, and following a major disaster or emergency.\"\nPittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 669-669k\nAlso known as the \"Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act,\" this statute authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to cooperate with the states, through their respective fish and game departments, in wildlife restoration projects, which are defined as the \"selection, restoration, rehabilitation, and improvement of areas of land or water adaptable as feeding, resting, or breeding places for wildlife.\" This statute was amended by the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000, discussed below.\nPublic Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 283e, 289d\nSection 404C of this statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 283e, directs the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), by October 1, 1993, to prepare a plan for the NIH to conduct or support research into methods of biomedical research and experimentation that do not require the use of animals, that reduce the number of animals used, that produce less pain and distress in animals used, and that involve the use of marine life other than marine mammals.\nSection 495 of this statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 289d, directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the NIH, to establish guidelines for research facilities as to the proper care and treatment of animals, including the appropriate use of tranquilizers, analgesics, and the like; but such guidelines may not prescribe methods of research. Entities that conduct biomedical and behavioral research with NIH funds must establish animal care committees which must conduct reviews at least semi-annually and report to the Director of NIH at least annually. If the Director determines that an entity has not been following the guidelines, he must give it an opportunity to take corrective action, and, if it does not, suspend or revoke its grant or contract.\nRecreational Hunting Safety and Preservation Act of 1994, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5201-5207\nThis statute makes it a violation, subject to a civil penalty of up to $10,000, \"intentionally to engage in any physical conduct that significantly hinders a lawful hunt ... on Federal lands.\" The conference report states that, to be a violation, \"the conduct must be intentional, and must be done with the intention of significantly hindering a lawful hunt.\" The statute also authorizes injunctive relief against violations.\nThe conference report gives examples of violations of the statute, including \"using visual, aural, olfactory, or physical stimuli to affect wildlife behavior.\" Ibid. This suggests the possibility that a court could construe mere words addressed to a hunter as \"physical conduct,\" if such words affected wildlife behavior (or a hunter's concentration) so as significantly to hinder a hunt. This apparently would not violate the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech, provided that the statute's civil penalty were imposed on the speaker for the effect of the sound of his words and not for their content. The statute states that \"[t]he term 'conduct' does not include speech protected by the first article of amendment to the Constitution\" (the statute does not otherwise define \"conduct\" or \"physical conduct\"), but this of course would go without saying, as Congress cannot punish speech that is protected by the First Amendment.\nRehabilitation Act of 1973: See Americans with Disabilities Act\nRhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5301-5306\nThis statute created the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Fund \"to provide financial assistance for projects for the conservation of rhinoceros and tigers.\"\nSalmon and Steelhead Conservation and Enhancement Act of 1980, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3345\nThis statute authorizes the establishment of a cooperative program involving the United States, the States of Washington and Oregon, and Indian Tribes, to \"encourage stability in and promote the economic well being\" of commercial fishing through \"coordinated research, enhancement, and management of salmon and steelhead resources and habitat.\"\nShark Finning Prohibition Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1822 note\nThis statute amended the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act by adding 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857(1)(P) to make it unlawful \"to remove any of the fins of a shark (including the tail) and discard the carcass of the shark at sea.\" It also requires the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Secretary of State, to, among other things, \"initiate discussions as soon as possible for the purpose of developing bilateral or multilateral agreements with other nations for the prohibition of shark-finning.\"\nSikes Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 670a-670o\nThis statute authorizes the Secretary of Defense\nto carry out a program of planning for, and the development, maintenance and coordination of, wildlife, fish, and game conservation and rehabilitation in each military reservation in accordance with a cooperative plan mutually agreed upon by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Interior, and the appropriate State agency designated by the State in which the reservation is located.\nSouth Pacific Tuna Act of 1988, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 973-973r\nThis statute implements the Treaty on Fisheries Between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States, signed April 2, 1987.\nTariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1527\nThis section of the Tariff Act of 1930 (also known as the \"Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act\" and the \"Smoot-Hawley Act\") prohibits the importation into the United States of any wild mammal or bird, alive or dead, or any part of product of any wild mammal or bird, if the laws or regulations of the country where the wild mammal or bird lives restrict its \"taking, killing, possession, or exportation to the United States,\" unless the wild mammal or bird is accompanied by a certification of the U.S. consul that it \"has not been acquired or exported in violation of the laws of regulations of such country. ...\"\nAny mammal or bird, alive or dead, or any part of product thereof, imported into the U.S. in violation of the above shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture under the customs laws. The Tariff Act of 1930 does not apply in the case of (1) articles the importation of which is prohibited by any other law, including 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a042(a) (the Lacey Act), (2) articles imported for scientific or educational purposes, or are migratory, or (3) certain migratory game birds.\nTuna Conventions Act of 1950, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 951-962\nThis statute prohibits fishing in violation of any regulation adopted by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to the Convention for the Establishment of an Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, and prohibits commerce in fish taken in violation of such regulations.\nTwenty-Eight Hour Law, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 80502\nPrior versions of this law were enacted in 1873 (Ch. 252, 42d Cong., 17 Stat. 584, R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4386-4389) and 1906 (Ch. 3594, 59 th Cong., 34 Stat. 607). The 1906 law was repealed and reenacted in amended form (but \"without substantive change\" ) in 1994 by P.L. 103 - 272 . (It was previously codified at 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a071-74.) It is also known as the \"Cruelty to Animals Act,\" the \"Live Stock Transportation Act,\" and the \"Food and Rest Law.\" As amended in 1994, it provides that \"a rail carrier, express carrier, or common carrier (except by air or water), a receiver, trustee, or lessee of one of those carriers, or an owner or master of a vessel transporting animals\" across state lines, \"may not confine animals in a vehicle or vessel for more than 28 consecutive hours without unloading the animals for feeding, water, and rest.\"\nIt also provides that \"[a]nimals being transported shall be unloaded in a humane way into pens equipped for feeding, water, and rest for at least 5 consecutive hours.\" The statute \"does not apply when animals are transported in a vehicle or vessel in which the animals have food, water, space, and an opportunity for rest.\"\nThe 28-hour period is subject to the following exceptions:\nSheep may be confined for an additional 8 consecutive hours without being unloaded when the 28-hour period of confinement ends at night. Animals may be confined for\u2014(A) more than 28 hours when the animals cannot be unloaded because of accidental or unavoidable causes that could not have been anticipated or avoided when being careful; and (B) 36 consecutive hours when the owner or person having custody of animals being transported requests, in writing and separate from a bill of lading or other rail form, that the 28-hour period be extended to 36 hours.\nThe Twenty-Eight Hour Law is enforced by the Attorney General, who, \"[o]n learning of a violation ... shall bring a civil action\" to collect a penalty of at least $100 but not more than $500 for each violation. The statute does not provide for criminal penalties. The statute does not mention any federal agency or official besides the Attorney General, but its 1906 version provided, \"It shall be the duty of all U.S. Attorneys to prosecute all violations of this Act reported by the Secretary of Agriculture,\" and, as noted above, the 1994 amendment was intended to be \"without substantive change\" to the 1906 version. In addition, in 1963, the USDA issued regulations under the act that remain in effect. 9 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 89.1-89.5. Therefore, it appears that the USDA continues to play a role in enforcing the act.\nIn 2006, noting \"that the plain meaning of the statutory term 'vehicle' in the Twenty-Eight Hour Law includes 'trucks' which operate as express carriers or common carriers,\" the USDA decided for the first time to interpret the act to include the transportation of animals by trucks. In the same document in which it announced this decision, the USDA noted: \"The Twenty-Eight Hour Law was never construed as being applicable to poultry, and ... USDA does not intend to change this longstanding interpretation of the statute.\"\nUnited States Housing Act of 1937: See National Housing Act\nUnited States-Russia Polar Bear Conservation and Management Act of 2006, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1423-1423h\nThis statute, which is part of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, makes it unlawful \"to take any polar bear in violation of the Agreement [Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation on the Conservation and Management of the Alaska-Chukotka Polar Bear Population].\" It also makes it unlawful \"to import, export, possess, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase, exchange, [or] barter ... any polar bear, or any part or product of a polar bear, that is taken in violation of\" the agreement or other restriction that is adopted by the commission established under the agreement. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to enforce the act.\nWendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41721\nThis statute, enacted April 5, 2000, requires air carriers that provide scheduled passenger air transportation to submit monthly reports to the Secretary of Transportation on any incidents involving the loss, injury, or death of an animal.

国家卫生健康委新闻发言人、宣传司副司长米锋:各位媒体朋友,大家下午好!欢迎大家参加国务院联防联控机制举办的新闻发布会。本周,全球新冠肺炎确诊病例超过2亿5千万例,一些国家新增确诊病例数接近或超过此前高点,我国外防输入压力持续增大。截至目前,本轮疫情波及全国21个省份。随着冬季来临、气温降低,新冠肺炎疫情与流感等呼吸道传染病叠加流行的风险增加。要坚持“外防输入、内防反弹”的总策略不动摇,坚持“动态清零”的防疫目标,做到及早发现、快速处置、精准管控、有效救治,确保疫情不出现规模性输入和反弹。要强化口岸城市疫情防控,做好人、物、环境同防,严控源头防输入。要始终做好个人防护,坚持戴口罩、勤洗手、多通风、少聚集,出现发热、咳嗽等症状,及时就医。要继续推进疫苗接种工作。截至11月12日,全国累计报告接种新冠病毒疫苗23亿7271.3万剂次,完成全程接种的人数为10亿7384.5万人。今天发布会的主题是进一步做好冬春季疫情防控,我们请来了教育部防控办主任、体育卫生与艺术教育司司长王登峰先生,国家卫生健康委疾控局副局长吴良有先生,国家卫生健康委医政医管局监察专员郭燕红女士,海关总署卫生检疫司司长林伟先生,中国疾控中心消毒学首席专家张流波先生,请他们共同就大家关心的问题来回答媒体的提问。下面,请各位记者朋友举手提问,提问前请先通报所在的新闻机构。中央广播电视总台新闻新媒体记者:就像刚刚主持人说的,本轮疫情已经涉及21个省份,请问目前最新的情况如何?预计未来的发展趋势又如何呢?谢谢。国家卫生健康委疾控局副局长吴良有:谢谢记者的提问。目前,全国疫情整体趋于平稳,前期受疫情影响的多个省份疫情已得到了有效控制,并且成功阻断了病毒的传播。黑龙江黑河、河北石家庄、河南郑州、四川成都等地的疫情正逐步得到控制。辽宁大连、北京、江西上饶、云南德宏等局部地区的疫情仍需关注。其中,大连疫情近日发展较快,目前处于胶着期,大连市内个别乡镇和街道出现社区传播,病例主要集中在庄河市,没有扩散到大连市之外的地区。北京-吉林关联疫情的感染人数局限,风险场所和风险人群的调查与管控措施正有序进行。本轮疫情发生以来,病毒的传染性强,疫情涉及的省份多。各地各部门坚决贯彻落实党中央、国务院的决策部署,迅速行动、担当尽责。国务院联防联控机制综合组及时派出前方工作组,指导疫情发生地区有序开展核酸检测,快速排查风险场所人群,强化重点人员的隔离管控,狠抓医疗救治和感染防控。陕西、内蒙古、甘肃、青海、宁夏、湖北、湖南、山东、江苏、浙江、贵州、重庆等省(区、市)的疫情基本都在一个潜伏期左右得到控制。目前,大连、黑河、成都、石家庄、上饶、瑞丽等重点地区仍有国务院联防联控机制综合组派出的工作组在当地指导疫情处置。国家卫生健康委将密切关注各地疫情形势,继续指导各地落实好防控措施,全力以赴控制疫情扩散蔓延,坚决巩固来之不易的防控成果。谢谢。香港中评社记者:随着冬季到来,学校疫情防控成为大家关心的问题。此外,当前已经进入了季节性呼吸道疾病多发期,为做好校园冬季疫情防控和其他传染病多病共防,教育部有哪些部署?谢谢。教育部防控办主任、体育卫生与艺术教育司司王登峰:谢谢记者的提问。进入秋冬季,像刚才吴良有先生介绍的,疫情目前还没有完全控制住,又加上冬季呼吸道疾病多发,所以如何多病共防是当前教育系统的一项重要任务。目前,教育部主要进行了以下三个方面的部署。一是要做到“三严”。第一要严把入校关。从疫情出现以来,我们采取的各项措施中,其中首先是要把好校门。所有的师生进校的时候都要做体温检测,而且都要关注他们的健康状况和旅行的轨迹,这是把好校门的问题。第二是在校内严格落实疫情防控各项措施,严格按照国家卫健委和教育部印发的关于高等学校、中小学校和托幼机构疫情防控技术方案,做到在校内所有的场所、所有人员聚集的地方都要严格落实疫情防控的各项措施,防止在校内出现感染。第三是一旦学校涉疫,就要严格落实疫情防控的应急预案,做到应隔离的尽快隔离,同时也要防止校园疫情向社会其他方面关联。二是做到“两实”。第一是严格落实疫情防控的应急方案,每个地方、每个学校都要做好疫情防控的应急预案,一旦出现问题就要及时启动。刚才我们讲涉疫的学校,他们就是严格按照疫情防控的应急预案来推行。第二是各校落实广泛开展爱国卫生运动,把冬季传染病和其他疾病、食品卫生、校园安全作为整体来统筹推进。这两个方面的落实,是确保校园安全稳定非常重要的步骤。三是做到“四个保障”。第一是各级各类学校疫情防控的各项措施、各项举措都要融入属地的疫情防控总体布局中来。学校的疫情防控,都要在属地的统一部署、统一管理之下来推进,这是国务院联防联控机制一个总体的要求。从联防联控来讲,校园应该是联防联控的一个重要环节,所以一定要在属地的统一部署下、统一支持指导下,做好校园的疫情防控工作。第二是把当地的疫情防控形势和应急预案有机结合起来,做好疫情防控的物资储备和各项后勤保障安排。同时还要随时准备一旦出现疫情,启动在线教育、在线教学。第三是要加强家校协同。从最近几次校园出现疫情的情况来看,几乎全部都是学生在跟他们共同居住人的接触过程中受到影响,而后带到校园里的。因此,校园的疫情防控跟整个社会的疫情防控是紧密相关的,所以家校的协作就变得尤为重要。特别是进入冬季以后,家庭成员或者共同居住的人如果出现感冒发烧,或者进出过涉疫的地区,这些情况各级教育行政部门、各校都要及时掌握,按照实际的情况和当地的疫情防控要求对学生及其共同居住的人采取相应的措施。第四是全力推进疫苗的接种。按照知情、自愿和同意的前提,我们鼓励各地各校广泛组织、广泛宣传,鼓励所有的师生及时接种新冠肺炎疫苗。这样的“三严”“两实”和“四保障”是我们秋冬季时期校园防控最主要的部署,也是各地正在认真贯彻落实的工作方案。谢谢。凤凰卫视记者:在乘坐公共交通工具时,有时手难免碰到门窗、座椅、拉环等部分,也有可能与其他乘客发生肢体上的碰触。在这样的情况下,手很难进行及时清洁和消毒。请问,现在市面上的消毒纸巾、消毒喷雾以及免洗洗手液能否很好达到消毒效果,在选购时应该注意什么?谢谢。中国疾控中心消毒学首席专家张流波:谢谢记者朋友。关于消毒剂、消毒湿巾能不能让手干净,这个问题首先应该是很肯定地回答,这是可以的,而且是肯定可以的。我们要让手干净卫生,主要有两种方式,一种是用流动水洗手,另外一种就是擦手消毒剂。用流动水洗手时,我们一般对手掌、手背、手指缝、手指尖、大拇指这些位置,都要进行彻底清洗。这时候步骤要求是比较严格的,而且要有足够的清洗时间和力度,相对来说这比较繁琐。我们常常说六步洗手,六个方面都要洗到。如果天气比较热,把袖子撸起来,手腕、肘部也会受到污染,如果接触到了可能的污染物也要洗,这时候就是所谓的“七步洗手”了。“七步洗手”比较麻烦,一般出门在外的时候,就像刚才记者问到的,实际上这是很难做到的,因为没有流动水的水源,所以这时候我们需要用手消毒剂来擦拭双手。手消毒剂揉搓双手的时候,这六个部位或者七个部位也要揉搓到,其实其揉搓起来还是比较方便的,所以用手消毒剂来做手的消毒,一般来说比较容易实施,条件要求也不那么高。出门在外的时候,擦手消毒剂应该是一个不错的选择。手消毒剂应该用含酒精的,这样作用时间比较快,能够很快达到消毒的效果。当然,也有一部分人可能对酒精过敏,这时候也可以用无醇的手消毒剂。如果在外面手比较脏了,又没有流动水洗手,就可以用消毒湿巾来擦拭双手,把手擦干净,消毒纸巾上也有消毒成分,能够让手部达到消毒效果。谢谢。中新社记者:本轮疫情之中,像黑龙江、甘肃等地报出来很多重症病例,想请问一下,截至目前这些重症病例的救治情况如何?另外,根据之前的报道说,这次疫情涉及老年患者比较多,重症比例比较高,但是近期在郑州等地通报的感染者之中有很多是未成年人,请问,根据不同年龄段患者的特点,我们应该如何分类施策进行医疗方案的制定?谢谢。国家卫生健康委医政医管局监察专员郭燕红:谢谢记者的提问。就像您说的,老年人和有基础性疾病的人是发生重症的高危因素。截至11月12日24时,这一轮涉及21个省份的感染者累计1379例,经过精心救治,现在有300多例已经治愈出院。这个过程中,累计重症患者85例,经过精心救治,有66例都已经转为轻症,甚至有的已经治愈出院。对重症的救治,我们通过同质化、规范化的救治和专家的指导以及“一人一策”,治疗效果还是非常不错的。像大家所关心的甘肃,甘肃最开始重症患者比较多,总数累计达28例,但经过积极救治,有25例患者都已经转轻或治愈出院。内蒙古重症患者累计总数曾经达到24例,有22例已经转为轻症或者治愈出院。黑龙江重症的总数是12例,因为疫情发生时间比较短,治疗时间也相对比较短,现在有6例转为轻症或者出院,还有6例在继续治疗。所以,现在有19例重症患者仍在医院进行精心救治,整体病情还是非常平稳的。针对不同年龄段的患者救治,我们在诊疗方案当中专门进行了分类诊疗方案的制定。比如,针对儿童我们有儿童的诊疗方案;针对有基础性疾病、老年这些高危因素的,也有相应的诊疗方案的要求,为医疗救治提供规范化的指引。刚才记者也提到了,像郑州儿童病例比较多,其实在前不久,福建莆田的儿童病例也比较多,针对儿童病人的特点,一是治疗手段和药物剂量不同于成人,二是大部分儿童相对症状比较轻,多数是轻型和普通型,因此在治疗过程中,我们专门派出儿科的专家进行指导,同时当地也专门组织了儿童的医护团队来承担儿童诊疗的具体工作。在儿童诊疗工作中,我们一方面是对症支持,另外一方面是保持充足的休息以及营养配餐,我们特别注重对儿童的照顾和心理的支持。对于有一些症状的,比如发热、咳嗽,我们一般优先选择中成药来改善孩子的症状。为了加强对患儿的人文关怀,我们特意在整个治疗中,比如有一些同班的孩子,尽量把他们安排在一起。比如有的是家庭聚集性的,建立家庭病房,这样的话给孩子最大化的人文关怀。我在莆田的时候遇到一例,老师和孩子都是阳性病例,我们有意安排班主任老师和孩子都在一个病房,给孩子最有效的心理支持。但有一些孩子没有相应的同伴或者家人,我们都专门安排了专业的医护团队来负责照顾孩子的起居,同时给他们最大化的心理关怀。对于老年人,特别是有一些基础性疾病的人,我们都及时派出了非常有经验的专家团队,第一时间赶到定点医院,指导当地的医护团队按照“一人一策”、多学科诊疗,对患者提供支持。所以在治疗过程中,一方面是多学科,另外一方面是及早对有重症倾向的患者进行重点管理,同时还加强预警指标的监测,最大化把措施实施在患者转重或者转危之前,也就是关口前移,给予患者最好的治疗。所以整体来讲,我们在治疗上,无论是对儿童还是对老人、有基础疾病的人,整体的治疗都是非常平稳的,效果也是非常好的,所以才有了在比较短的时间内有60多例患者已经转轻或治愈出院。从救治方面来讲,我们积累了一定的经验,在同质化、规范化诊疗方面,效果还是不错的。谢谢。中央广播电视总台cgtn记者:目前,全球疫情包括周边国家疫情还在持续加大,我们边境口岸城市面临的疫情防控压力也在持续加大,请问海关制定了哪些措施来做好疫情防控工作?谢谢。海关总署卫生检疫司司长林伟:谢谢您刚才的提问。就像您刚才提到的,当前我国周边国家疫情形势严峻复杂,海关总署坚持“外防输入、内防反弹”总策略,按照国务院联防联控机制要求,部署全国海关毫不放松抓好陆路边境口岸疫情防控工作,坚决把疫情防控的各项措施落实落细落到位。一方面,我们严格落实陆路边境口岸“外防输入”各项政策措施,成立专项工作组,持续监测周边国家疫情发展态势,做到“一日一研判”。陆路边境口岸海关根据通关需求等实际情况,不断完善疫情防控工作方案和应急预案,做到“一口岸一方案”。陆路边境口岸海关坚决落实“客停货通”“人货分离”等防控政策,推动地方实施“甩挂”“接驳”“吊装”等非接触式货物交接模式。对入境人员严格“三查三排一转运”等措施,完善对跨境司机、边民等高风险人群疫情防控工作链条,与地方联防联控机制无缝衔接,严格做到闭环管理。同时,我们也坚持人、物、环境同防,按照国务院联防联控机制工作方案,在口岸环节严格做好进口冷链食品和高风险非冷链集装箱货物的抽样监测检测和预防性消毒监督工作。严格落实国务院联防联控机制关于口岸高风险从业人员的管理要求,严格实施“两点一线”“14+7+7”等封闭管理措施,始终保持海关口岸一线人员疫苗接种全覆盖,并持续推进加强免疫,从严、就高做好安全防护工作。另一方面,我们也加大对陆路边境口岸海关的支持力度,加强疫情防控和应急处置能力。在硬件方面,我们加强负压隔离室、快速检测实验室、p2实验室等设施的改造和提升,推动陆路边境口岸检测能力大幅度提高;加强移动p2实验室储备,做好在应急状态下驰援陆路边境口岸的准备。在人员方面,我们做好海关疫情防控人员“一线、预备、应急”三级梯队建设,确保在口岸突发公共事件发生时能够第一时间从周边海关抽调专业人员支援陆路边境口岸有关防疫工作。在经费、物资保障方面,我们继续加大对陆路边境口岸疫情防控经费倾斜力度,确保防控物资充足,全方位提升陆路边境口岸海关疫情防控能力和应急处置能力。谢谢。财经杂志财经大健康记者:刚才提到全国迎来了新一轮降温,可能会给疫情防控增加难度。想请问一下我们在冬春季疫情防控和新冠疫苗接种方面有哪些工作?谢谢。吴良有:谢谢这位记者朋友。正像您提到的,近期全国多个地区出现了大幅度降温,给核酸检测、流调排查、社区管控等疫情防控工作带来了难度。不少专家也研判,今年冬春季的疫情防控形势较去年将更为复杂。当然,我们在成功处置国内聚集性疫情的过程中,也积累了很多好的经验和做法,今年冬春季疫情防控将重点围绕“早、小、严、实、准”五个方面开展工作。一是要抓“早”。坚持早发现、早报告、早处置,这是疫情防控的关键。要保持重点人群的“应检尽检”和发热门诊哨点的灵敏性,提高疫情监测的敏感性,发现报告的时效性以及应对处置的及时性。一旦发现本土聚集性疫情,迅速调集核酸检测、流调溯源、医疗救治等队伍赶赴现场,指导处置工作,赢得疫情防控的先机。二是要抓“小”。国家卫生健康委将会同有关部门指导各地按照“从严从紧”的原则,全面梳理风险点,结合自身实际,细化完善防控工作实施细则,对于意想不到的情形,要求地方要及时报告、及时处置,不放过任何风险环节,不放过任何可能的疑点。三是要抓“严”。要严格按照技术规范组织开展入境人员的管理、闭环转运、隔离观察、核酸检测以及物品环境消毒,进口冷链食品管理等重点环节的工作。对于高风险人群,要严格实施闭环管理,加密开展核酸检测,坚决杜绝疫情的风险外溢。四是要抓“实”。医疗机构、旅游景点、交通场站、餐饮单位、宾馆酒店等公共场所要落实好查码、测温、戴口罩等要求,对于已经赋黄码、赋红码的人员,既要动员群众自觉落实防疫措施,更要发挥好各基层社区还有公共场所验码查码的作用,排查到位、管控到位,坚决杜绝“脱管”“漏管”的情况发生。五是要抓“准”。在快速处置疫情的同时,我们要突出精准科学,更加精准地判定密接和次密接,划定风险区域。在隔离管控时,对于风险人群要完善赋码解码规则,做到“快赋快解”。在区域协查时,要科学界定好时空关系、风险等级,避免发生“误伤”的情况。在服务保障时,要提供更有针对性地服务和关怀,着力提高群众的满意度,努力以最小的成本取得最大的防控成效,尽最大可能减少对经济社会的影响。关于新冠病毒疫苗接种工作,根据我们今年下半年新冠病毒疫苗接种的安排,还有冬季疫情防控工作需要,将继续推进重点人群的疫苗加强免疫和3—11岁人群的新冠病毒疫苗接种工作,对重点人群要实现“应接尽接”。目前,3—11岁人群已经接种了8439.5万人,加强免疫已经接种4944万人,我们将力争在12月底完成3—11岁人群的全程接种工作。同时,指导各地合理安排资源,统筹做好流感等呼吸道疫苗的接种工作,降低呼吸道传染病和新冠肺炎叠加流行的风险。各地也在结合实际情况,创新服务模式,合理设置接种单位,做好恶劣天气下的接种安排,方便群众接种。在这里也提醒大家,尽量提前预约接种,减少现场等待的时间,接种时合理增加衣物,注意防寒保暖,希望大家能够继续支持疫苗接种工作。谢谢。新华社记者:我的问题和校园疫苗接种有关,随着我国启动3—11岁儿童的新冠病毒疫苗接种,现在疫苗接种已经覆盖大、中、小学等所有符合接种条件的学生。请问,学校怎么配合做好宣传引导工作?谢谢。王登峰:感谢记者的提问。刚才您也说到了,大、中、小学正在按照国家的统一部署,稳步推进新冠疫苗的接种工作。目前,18岁以上的学生新冠疫苗接种已经在95%以上。刚才吴局长介绍,3—11岁的孩子已经接种了8千多万,1.6亿的3—11岁的孩子已经有一半开始接种了,所以这是一个很好的成绩。从新冠肺炎疫苗的接种,特别对于3—11岁以及11—18岁这个年龄段的孩子来讲,我们和国家整个疫苗接种的方针是一样的,就是以知情、自愿和同意为前提。所以从学校来讲,要做的工作有以下几方面。第一是要让所有的师生,包括学生的家长要“知情”。知情就是要通过科普宣传,让所有的学生和家长了解新冠肺炎疫苗的安全性、有效性以及个人接种疫苗对整个学校、家庭、个人的保护作用。第二是要求学校要积极配合做好新冠肺炎疫苗接种的各项组织和后勤保障工作。特别对于未成年人来讲,新冠肺炎疫苗的接种要由监护人陪同,如果有些地方要在校园里实施疫苗接种,学校要做好这方面的后勤保障工作。第三是对于儿童青少年,接种疫苗对他们来讲可能是一件很让人害怕的事情,所以从教育系统来讲,要通过学校对孩子进行心理疏导,减轻他们对接种疫苗的恐惧。我们经常看到有的孩子打一个疫苗会哭半天,从学校来讲,其实可以通过心理辅导去帮助学生,使这些儿童青少年减轻焦虑和紧张,这也是从学校来讲,配合的一个非常重要的方面。最后,对于儿童青少年的接种疫苗,要给予学生家长更多的自主选择机会。如果学生和家长在知情、自愿、同意的情况下,学校要配合他们做好接种疫苗整个过程的服务和保障工作,让青少年能够安全、自愿地接受新冠肺炎疫苗。谢谢。中央广播电视总台央视社会与法频道记者:疫情防控可以说是不见硝烟的战场,其中医务人员是距离危险最近的人,在本轮疫情中已经发现有多名医务人员确诊。请问,医务人员在工作当中应该如何做好个人防护?国家卫生健康委近期采取了哪些措施来强化院感防控及定点救治医院的管理工作?此外,甘肃省此前有3名卫校学生在救援一线核酸采样时被感染,这种情况如何避免?谢谢。郭燕红:谢谢这位记者的提问。正像这位记者所提的那样,医务人员由于每天要和患者接触,从事医疗服务的整个过程,是职业暴露的高风险人群,也是发生感染的高风险人群。因此,我们高度重视医务人员预防和控制感染的各项工作,包括院内交叉感染的预防和控制工作。在医务人员的预防感染过程中,我们强调四个方面。第一,要完善制度。各个医疗机构从管理到临床一线,要建立一系列的预防和控制医院感染的规章制度。第二,细化技术规范。对于临床当中的一些操作,包括工作流程,都需要有一系列的技术指南和规范来进行指引。第三,加强全员培训。医院感染的预防与控制涉及整个工作过程以及医疗机构的各个环节,所以全员的培训,特别是对一线医护人员的培训非常重要。让他们在工作中能够自觉执行和落实相应的操作规范。第四,加大监督、指导、检查的力度,针对薄弱环节、针对问题不断进行改善。大家也注意到,作为新冠病毒特别是变异的德尔塔毒株,其传染性非常强,而且病毒载量特别高。医务人员长期在一线工作,发生职业暴露的风险也高,所以有一些医疗机构发生了医务人员的感染。我们针对凡是因相关规章制度没有落实发生医务人员感染的医疗机构,发现一起通报一起,在全国进行通报,让其他的医疗机构从中汲取教训,引以为戒、举一反三。在落实相关预防和控制医院感染过程中,定点医疗机构是其中一个重要环节,因为定点医疗机构主要是负责确诊病人的收治工作,所以医院感染工作就更为重要。我们对定点医疗机构首先是落实投入的责任,对医院感染的防控,建筑布局、通道以及房间的设置,都需要有硬件的投入。所以,在这方面我们要求地方要选择综合能力强,并且能够达到医院感染防控要求的医疗机构作为定点医院。我们对定点医院有一揽子的评估要求,地方卫生行政部门要按照评估要求选择符合条件的定点医院。其次,加大对所有医务人员,包括在一线工作的其他专业人员的闭环管理。在闭环管理当中,确保所有的医务人员的健康监测到位,并且加密核酸检测,最大化甄别和发现潜在感染的风险。三是加大对所有定点人员上岗前的培训。所有的医务人员在上岗前都要经过规范培训,经考核合格方能上岗。同时,在培训过程中,我们着重对防护物品的使用、防护技术的应用等方面进行精心安排。刚才记者提到,有些地方出现了在核酸采样过程中使用非卫生专业技术人员,有的还是卫校的学生,在这点上,其实我们在文件中都已经进行了规定。因为核酸采样以及核酸检测,专业性和技术性比较强,还涉及生物安全问题,因此我们要求非卫生专业技术人员是不能够直接从事核酸采样和检测工作的,只有医生和护士等专业技术人员才能够做这项工作,而且在工作过程中要遵循相关技术规范、指南要求,确保安全,防止交叉感染。谢谢。香港经济导报记者:请问对于商场、超市、影剧院等室内空间应采取哪些消毒措施,以防范疫情交叉传播?谢谢。张流波:谢谢,这个问题也是大家所关注的。商场、超市都和老百姓的日常生活密切相关,所以在低风险地区,还是应该正常营业。作为顾客,这些地方是要去,但是我们可以尽量减少去的机会和时间,进去是买东西,不是逛商店。商场、超市、影剧院这些室内公共场所,要加强防控工作,至少应该注意以下七个方面的问题。第一,对重点部位、重点物品,要加强消毒。如购物车、购物篮应该是用一次消毒一次,循环消毒。像门帘、电梯按钮、自动扶梯、柜台台面等地方应该增加清洁消毒频次。地面、墙壁这些地方要定期做好消毒工作。第二,关于中央空调。不管是全空气系统,还是风机盘管+新风系统,都应该使用空气净化消毒装置,对回风进行消毒处理,否则应该采用全新风模式。单纯用最大新风量运行的,只是不具备条件的一个过渡阶段,应该尽早用全新风,或者对回风进行消毒以后再运行。第三,服务人员应该全程接种疫苗,应该有健康申报制度、体温检测制度,要及时发现可疑的症状。第四,对顾客应该进行健康扫码登记,便于追溯。应进行体温监测制度,尽早识别可疑感染者。在购物时应该保持一米以上的距离。哪怕是过秤、交款、排队的时候,都应该保持一米以上距离。第五,在付款时应该尽量选用非接触的电子付款方式。第六,不管是顾客还是工作人员,都应该戴好口罩、做好防护。同时,要做好手部卫生。第七,如果发现了可疑病例或密切接触者,应该及时向当地疾控部门报告,配合疾控部门采取相关的防控工作,在他们的指导下做好流调、隔离、消毒工作。谢谢。南方都市报记者:请问在这次的新冠肺炎病例中,中医药发挥了什么样的作用?国家在中医药协同治疗方面有哪些安排?谢谢。郭燕红:谢谢这位记者的提问。确实,在这次新冠肺炎患者的救治工作中,中医药发挥了非常重要的作用。在这个过程中,我们的中医专家边救治边总结,筛选出了一批有效的方药,既有通用方,也有针对不同病情、不同症型的方剂,同时还有中成药。在治疗过程中,体现了辩病辩证的统一。一是对于轻型和普通型患者用药,以中医药治疗为主,特别是在改善患者的发热、咳嗽、纳差、乏力等临床症状中,发挥了很好的作用。在这个过程中,中西医之间密切结合,西医方面,更多给予患者氧疗,对症支持,减少轻型、普通型向重症的转化。二是对于重症患者来讲,中医药发挥了很好的作用,中西医结合在一起,通过使用一些中医药,在退高热、促进肺部渗出的吸收等方面,能够起到非常好的作用。三是对于康复的患者,往往是肺部渗出有明显改善,没有特别的发热、咳嗽症状,加上两次核酸检测阴性,基本上患者就可以治愈出院。但往往患者还是有一些不太舒服,比如乏力、纳差、气虚等。在这些方面,中医药在促进患者的康复方面,也可以发挥非常好的作用。此外,针对无症状感染者,包括在隔离点集中隔离的密接、次密接人员,指导各地根据气候和人员体质不同来进行中医药的预防治疗。大家可以看到,从预防一直到轻症的治疗,重症的救治以及康复整个全过程,中西医结合、中西药并用,在这个过程中,我们建立了“四有”的机制,就是在定点医院当中,第一要有团队,要有中医的团队;第二要有机制,就是中西医协同的机制;第三要有措施;第四是有成效。这个过程中我们还建立了“四个联合”,第一是中西医联合组成国家级专家组;第二是在制定和完善诊疗方案中,中西医专家联合在一起,对诊疗方案进行不断完善和修订;第三是对一线的救治工作进行指导会诊。刚才良有也提到,只要疫情一发生,我们派出多个队伍,其中一个队伍是医疗救治队伍。而医疗救治队伍在派出过程中,也是既有西医中的重症、呼吸、感染等专家,也有中医的专家,联合赴一线,对一线救治工作进行联合指导和会诊。第四是在救治过程中,一线的团队也专门有中医的医务人员,中西医结合在一起,共同为患者提供救治。所以,在整个患者救治过程中,全程都体现了中西医结合、中西药并重的原则,整体效果是非常不错的,在这方面,我们积累了非常好的经验。其实不光是在新冠肺炎的救治当中,在其他疾病的救治当中,中西医结合也是非常重要的。谢谢。中国教育电视台记者:我们注意到,本轮疫情在北京、河南郑州等地报告的病例当中都有中小学生,所以想请问,教育部门对此采取了哪些防控措施,如何避免疫情在校园内的传播呢?谢谢。王登峰:感谢记者的提问。对于中小学出现新冠肺炎疫情,首先要启动新冠肺炎疫情防控的应急机制。这是我们对所有学校的基本要求,各地各校其实已经做了充分的准备,宁可备而不用,也不可用时不备。应急预案首先就是要做到对涉疫的师生进行救治,同时对环境进行消杀,还要启动对相关密接者和次密接者隔离的问题,这些都要按照技术方案去严格落实。在采取完这两项措施之后,紧接着从对学校正常教育教学秩序来讲,如果需要停课,还要启动在线教学的方案。也就是说,如果学生不能够到校学习,特别对中小学生来讲,他们要回到家居家,这时候的在线学习就显得特别重要。而且在在线教育实施过程中,还要在在线课程中增加指导学生如何在家度过隔离的时期。除了上好文化课之外,体育课、艺术课、劳动课等,也要通过在线的方式,让孩子们能够在紧张学习之余还能够像在校园一样,参加到相关的体育艺术活动中去。同时,也要给学生们提供一定的心理辅导和引导。如何防止疫情传入校园或者传出,我刚才已经回答了。目前,从整个学校的疫情防控来讲,我们本着“三严”的原则,一是严格防止疫情进校园,就是在校门管控和师生的健康监测、健康管理方面采取的相应措施。二是校内要严格落实技术方案,就是要做好各项疫情防控的措施。三是,如果学校涉疫之后,不管是隔离还是在线教学,都要确保不要由校园再作为一个新的传染点引向校外,这也是涉疫学校疫情防控工作中特别关注的一个问题。前几天大家可能在新闻里看到了,一个学校有一个学生是密接者,当学校了解这个情况之后,立即要求当时在校内的所有师生都要留在校内,组织进行全员核酸检测。在核酸检测结果没有出来之前,校园里只许进不许出。从校园来讲,一旦学校涉疫,除了要防止新冠肺炎疫情在校内传播之外,还要考虑不能因为学校里的师生外出给社会带来新的威胁。这是我们对涉疫学校所采取的一系列措施。其他学校也要严格按照属地和相关疫情防控的要求,做好落实。谢谢。人民日报记者:现在快递已经成为我们日常生活中不可缺少的一部分了,尤其是“双十一”刚过,正是集中收发快递的时候,很多人会关注,收发快递是否存在传播新冠病毒的风险以及我们应该如何防范这类风险?谢谢。张流波:谢谢这位记者。快递现在大家比较关注,关于快递传播新冠病毒,应该同时满足这几个条件:第一,在收运快递的过程中被新冠病毒污染。第二,我们在收快递的时候,快递物品上面的新冠病毒还存活。第三,我们在接收快递时,受到新冠病毒的污染。所以,预防快递传播新冠病毒,也要从这三个方面着手。第一,设法避免污染:如中高风险地区暂停快递业务,暂不收取高风险人群、发热病人交寄的快递;快递员要加强健康管理,确保不被感染,不带病上岗;快递转运途中要做好保护,包装不直接暴露在外。第二,在收递快件后,集中分拣环节由快递公司对快递表面进行消毒处理。第三,我们在收快递时做好适度防护,戴口罩、手套,人员保持一米距离等。快递的表面包装要求不带入室内,确要带入时可以采用消毒湿巾六面擦拭消毒或进行喷雾消毒等。当然,要强调一点,我们处理完快递后一定要做好手部卫生。谢谢。米锋:由于时间关系,请大家提问最后两个问题。红星新闻记者:此前,国务院联防联控机制医疗救治组印发了《关于进一步强化当前新冠病毒核酸检测服务的通知》(以下简称《通知》),各地要在近期内对核酸检测工作各项要求落实情况再部署、再检查。如今《通知》已经发布了半个多月了,请问针对《通知》中提到的各项要求,各地的核酸检测机构落实情况如何?另外,当前多地出现了散发疫情,请问现在各地的核酸检测能力是否充足?能否满足“应检尽检”和“愿检尽检”人群的需求?谢谢。郭燕红:谢谢这位记者的提问。核酸检测是我们落实“四早”的关键措施。10月22日,国务院联防联控机制医疗救治组专门对全国有关加强核酸检测服务这项工作进行了再部署、再要求。从文件发布以后到现在,各地做了大量工作,在有关能力建设、合理布局、提高效率、优化服务等方面多措并举。第一,加强了核酸检测机构的合理化布局。进行网格化管理,让老百姓能够就近寻求到核酸检测服务。在这个过程中,各地纷纷用各种形式进行社会公开,有的是在网站上公开了机构的名称、地址、服务时间,向公众告知。有的采用了地图、电子导航技术,让老百姓了解核酸检测机构的分布,就近得到核酸检测服务。第二,优化了核酸检测服务。比如,很多机构都开展了线上预约服务,同时延长了检测的时间,拉长了班次,有的还增加了检测的号源,满足老百姓“应检尽检”“愿检尽检”的要求。特别是很多机构都开展了24小时的检测服务,最大化满足人民群众核酸检测的需求。第三,大大缩短了结果反馈时间。对于重点人群,我们已经实现了6小时以内反馈核酸检测结果。对于“愿检尽检”的人群,部分地区已经实现了6小时以内出具检测结果,而且有些地方通过线上的手段,能够让大家在手机端,甚至在健康宝上就能够及时查到检测结果,而且还能够打印检测报告。第四,不断提升核酸检测的质量。核酸检测这项工作技术性很强,因此为保证检测质量,每一个核酸检测机构都要加强室内的质控。同时,我们通过国家临检中心和省级临检中心,对每一个开展核酸检测的机构进行了室间质评,像国家的质评,今年已经做了9次,并将检测结果及时反馈到相应检测机构。省内也加大了室间质评的频次,最大化保证核酸检测的质量。我们都知道,一旦发生疫情,各地都第一时间启动全员核酸检测,力争在最短时间内锁定感染范围,同时加快有关疫情防控的各项措施。我们要求500万以下人口的城市,要在两天以内完成全员核酸检测;500万以上人口的城市,要在三天以内完成全员核酸检测。各地要按照上述要求对核酸检测能力储备、采样人员安排、实验室检测安排、样品转运安排等做出预案。一旦发生疫情,启动全员核酸检测过程中,势必会有一些城市、地区的核酸检测能力一时不能满足需求,我们会启动省内及省外调集力量的机制,最大化地支持和满足疫情发生地全员核酸检测的需求。同时,还有一项工作非常重要,就是信息化的支持。我们正会同相关部门对核酸检测信息系统进行评测优化,一旦发生疫情,在启动全员核酸检测的过程当中,用以对采样、转运、检测、信息反馈全流程提供信息化支持。通过信息化的手段,在提高效率的同时,也能够提高整个核酸检测过程的协同性,并实现精准的结果反馈。谢谢。中国青年报记者:目前疫情发生区域学校已经停课,是否会考虑像2020年春季学期一样全面开展线上教学?受目前疫情影响,很多家长在讨论,今年学生特别是大学生会提前放寒假吗?谢谢。王登峰:感谢这位记者的提问。从涉疫学校和个别疫情反复比较大的地方,目前确实已经开始中小学的停课。出现疫情的个别高校也进行了封闭式管理,采取在线教学的方式就显得尤为重要,但还没有必要全面开展线上教学。目前的情况只是对涉疫学校和需要暂停上下学的地方及时启动在线教学。经过这两年,我们对疫情防控已经积累了非常丰富的经验,根据疫情防控的要求,随时可以启动各级各类学校的在线教学,这方面的资源是非常充足的。我们经过这两年努力,在线教学的资源和课程设置,都已经做得非常周到了。在线课程不仅仅是文化课,还包括体育课、艺术课、心理辅导、疫情科普知识等。现在到了冬季,很多地方已经开始谋划寒假的安排。实际上从今年10月份教育部就发出通知,要求各地各校根据疫情防控的要求、属地政策安排、学校的学习情况、课程进展情况等及早谋划今年寒假的安排。从目前来看,我们还是要按照这样的总基调来推进。特别是北方天气比较寒冷,寒假时间比较长,可能有些学校已经开始在策划了。是否提前放寒假,第一是要看疫情形势的发展,第二是要根据属地对疫情防控措施各方面的要求,既包括疫情防控的举措,也包括一旦放寒假,高校学生可能要离开当地回乡,要同时考虑高校所在地和生源地两个地方疫情防控的要求。我们要根据各地各校的实际情况,鼓励所有的高校在属地管理的前提下,结合校园防控的要求以及课程进展的情况、学习安排的情况,由各地各校进行自主决定。我们也希望大家都关心和支持疫情防控工作,对于提前放假或者推迟放假的情况,都应该理解和支持。谢谢。米锋:谢谢王登峰先生。今天的发布会,几位嘉宾为我们介绍了当前疫情防控形势和医疗救治的一些情况,还介绍了学校等重点场所的疫情防控、疫苗接种等情况,也给我们交流了一些消毒的常用知识,再次感谢各位嘉宾。后续我们还将继续举办新闻发布会,欢迎大家继续关注。今天的发布会到此结束,谢谢大家。

"国家卫生健康委新闻发言人、宣传司副司长米锋:各位媒体朋友,大家下午好!欢迎大家参加国务院联防联控机制举办的新闻发布会。本周,全球新冠肺炎确诊病例超过2亿5千万例,一些国家新增确诊病例数接近或超过此前高点,我国外防输入压力持续增大。截至目前,本轮疫情波及全国21个省份。随着冬季来临、气温降低,新冠肺炎疫情与流感等呼吸道传染病叠加流行的风险增加。要坚持“外防输入、内防反弹”的总策略不动摇,坚持“动态清零”的防疫目标,做到及早发现、快速处置、精准管控、有效救治,确保疫情不出现规模性输入和反弹。要强化口岸城市疫情防控,做好人、物、环境同防,严控源头防输入。要始终做好个人防护,坚持戴口罩、勤洗手、多通风、少聚集,出现发热、咳嗽等症状,及时就医。要继续推进疫苗接种工作。截至11月12日,全国累计报告接种新冠病毒疫苗23亿7271.3万剂次,完成全程接种的人数为10亿7384.5万人。今天发布会的主题是进一步做好冬春季疫情防控,我们请来了教育部防控办主任、体育卫生与艺术教育司司长王登峰先生,国家卫生健康委疾控局副局长吴良有先生,国家卫生健康委医政医管局监察专员郭燕红女士,海关总署卫生检疫司司长林伟先生,中国疾控中心消毒学首席专家张流波先生,请他们共同就大家关心的问题来回答媒体的提问。下面,请各位记者朋友举手提问,提问前请先通报所在的新闻机构。中央广播电视总台新闻新媒体记者:就像刚刚主持人说的,本轮疫情已经涉及21个省份,请问目前最新的情况如何?预计未来的发展趋势又如何呢?谢谢。国家卫生健康委疾控局副局长吴良有:谢谢记者的提问。目前,全国疫情整体趋于平稳,前期受疫情影响的多个省份疫情已得到了有效控制,并且成功阻断了病毒的传播。黑龙江黑河、河北石家庄、河南郑州、四川成都等地的疫情正逐步得到控制。辽宁大连、北京、江西上饶、云南德宏等局部地区的疫情仍需关注。其中,大连疫情近日发展较快,目前处于胶着期,大连市内个别乡镇和街道出现社区传播,病例主要集中在庄河市,没有扩散到大连市之外的地区。北京-吉林关联疫情的感染人数局限,风险场所和风险人群的调查与管控措施正有序进行。本轮疫情发生以来,病毒的传染性强,疫情涉及的省份多。各地各部门坚决贯彻落实党中央、国务院的决策部署,迅速行动、担当尽责。国务院联防联控机制综合组及时派出前方工作组,指导疫情发生地区有序开展核酸检测,快速排查风险场所人群,强化重点人员的隔离管控,狠抓医疗救治和感染防控。陕西、内蒙古、甘肃、青海、宁夏、湖北、湖南、山东、江苏、浙江、贵州、重庆等省(区、市)的疫情基本都在一个潜伏期左右得到控制。目前,大连、黑河、成都、石家庄、上饶、瑞丽等重点地区仍有国务院联防联控机制综合组派出的工作组在当地指导疫情处置。国家卫生健康委将密切关注各地疫情形势,继续指导各地落实好防控措施,全力以赴控制疫情扩散蔓延,坚决巩固来之不易的防控成果。谢谢。香港中评社记者:随着冬季到来,学校疫情防控成为大家关心的问题。此外,当前已经进入了季节性呼吸道疾病多发期,为做好校园冬季疫情防控和其他传染病多病共防,教育部有哪些部署?谢谢。教育部防控办主任、体育卫生与艺术教育司司王登峰:谢谢记者的提问。进入秋冬季,像刚才吴良有先生介绍的,疫情目前还没有完全控制住,又加上冬季呼吸道疾病多发,所以如何多病共防是当前教育系统的一项重要任务。目前,教育部主要进行了以下三个方面的部署。一是要做到“三严”。第一要严把入校关。从疫情出现以来,我们采取的各项措施中,其中首先是要把好校门。所有的师生进校的时候都要做体温检测,而且都要关注他们的健康状况和旅行的轨迹,这是把好校门的问题。第二是在校内严格落实疫情防控各项措施,严格按照国家卫健委和教育部印发的关于高等学校、中小学校和托幼机构疫情防控技术方案,做到在校内所有的场所、所有人员聚集的地方都要严格落实疫情防控的各项措施,防止在校内出现感染。第三是一旦学校涉疫,就要严格落实疫情防控的应急预案,做到应隔离的尽快隔离,同时也要防止校园疫情向社会其他方面关联。二是做到“两实”。第一是严格落实疫情防控的应急方案,每个地方、每个学校都要做好疫情防控的应急预案,一旦出现问题就要及时启动。刚才我们讲涉疫的学校,他们就是严格按照疫情防控的应急预案来推行。第二是各校落实广泛开展爱国卫生运动,把冬季传染病和其他疾病、食品卫生、校园安全作为整体来统筹推进。这两个方面的落实,是确保校园安全稳定非常重要的步骤。三是做到“四个保障”。第一是各级各类学校疫情防控的各项措施、各项举措都要融入属地的疫情防控总体布局中来。学校的疫情防控,都要在属地的统一部署、统一管理之下来推进,这是国务院联防联控机制一个总体的要求。从联防联控来讲,校园应该是联防联控的一个重要环节,所以一定要在属地的统一部署下、统一支持指导下,做好校园的疫情防控工作。第二是把当地的疫情防控形势和应急预案有机结合起来,做好疫情防控的物资储备和各项后勤保障安排。同时还要随时准备一旦出现疫情,启动在线教育、在线教学。第三是要加强家校协同。从最近几次校园出现疫情的情况来看,几乎全部都是学生在跟他们共同居住人的接触过程中受到影响,而后带到校园里的。因此,校园的疫情防控跟整个社会的疫情防控是紧密相关的,所以家校的协作就变得尤为重要。特别是进入冬季以后,家庭成员或者共同居住的人如果出现感冒发烧,或者进出过涉疫的地区,这些情况各级教育行政部门、各校都要及时掌握,按照实际的情况和当地的疫情防控要求对学生及其共同居住的人采取相应的措施。第四是全力推进疫苗的接种。按照知情、自愿和同意的前提,我们鼓励各地各校广泛组织、广泛宣传,鼓励所有的师生及时接种新冠肺炎疫苗。这样的“三严”“两实”和“四保障”是我们秋冬季时期校园防控最主要的部署,也是各地正在认真贯彻落实的工作方案。谢谢。凤凰卫视记者:在乘坐公共交通工具时,有时手难免碰到门窗、座椅、拉环等部分,也有可能与其他乘客发生肢体上的碰触。在这样的情况下,手很难进行及时清洁和消毒。请问,现在市面上的消毒纸巾、消毒喷雾以及免洗洗手液能否很好达到消毒效果,在选购时应该注意什么?谢谢。中国疾控中心消毒学首席专家张流波:谢谢记者朋友。关于消毒剂、消毒湿巾能不能让手干净,这个问题首先应该是很肯定地回答,这是可以的,而且是肯定可以的。我们要让手干净卫生,主要有两种方式,一种是用流动水洗手,另外一种就是擦手消毒剂。用流动水洗手时,我们一般对手掌、手背、手指缝、手指尖、大拇指这些位置,都要进行彻底清洗。这时候步骤要求是比较严格的,而且要有足够的清洗时间和力度,相对来说这比较繁琐。我们常常说六步洗手,六个方面都要洗到。如果天气比较热,把袖子撸起来,手腕、肘部也会受到污染,如果接触到了可能的污染物也要洗,这时候就是所谓的“七步洗手”了。“七步洗手”比较麻烦,一般出门在外的时候,就像刚才记者问到的,实际上这是很难做到的,因为没有流动水的水源,所以这时候我们需要用手消毒剂来擦拭双手。手消毒剂揉搓双手的时候,这六个部位或者七个部位也要揉搓到,其实其揉搓起来还是比较方便的,所以用手消毒剂来做手的消毒,一般来说比较容易实施,条件要求也不那么高。出门在外的时候,擦手消毒剂应该是一个不错的选择。手消毒剂应该用含酒精的,这样作用时间比较快,能够很快达到消毒的效果。当然,也有一部分人可能对酒精过敏,这时候也可以用无醇的手消毒剂。如果在外面手比较脏了,又没有流动水洗手,就可以用消毒湿巾来擦拭双手,把手擦干净,消毒纸巾上也有消毒成分,能够让手部达到消毒效果。谢谢。中新社记者:本轮疫情之中,像黑龙江、甘肃等地报出来很多重症病例,想请问一下,截至目前这些重症病例的救治情况如何?另外,根据之前的报道说,这次疫情涉及老年患者比较多,重症比例比较高,但是近期在郑州等地通报的感染者之中有很多是未成年人,请问,根据不同年龄段患者的特点,我们应该如何分类施策进行医疗方案的制定?谢谢。国家卫生健康委医政医管局监察专员郭燕红:谢谢记者的提问。就像您说的,老年人和有基础性疾病的人是发生重症的高危因素。截至11月12日24时,这一轮涉及21个省份的感染者累计1379例,经过精心救治,现在有300多例已经治愈出院。这个过程中,累计重症患者85例,经过精心救治,有66例都已经转为轻症,甚至有的已经治愈出院。对重症的救治,我们通过同质化、规范化的救治和专家的指导以及“一人一策”,治疗效果还是非常不错的。像大家所关心的甘肃,甘肃最开始重症患者比较多,总数累计达28例,但经过积极救治,有25例患者都已经转轻或治愈出院。内蒙古重症患者累计总数曾经达到24例,有22例已经转为轻症或者治愈出院。黑龙江重症的总数是12例,因为疫情发生时间比较短,治疗时间也相对比较短,现在有6例转为轻症或者出院,还有6例在继续治疗。所以,现在有19例重症患者仍在医院进行精心救治,整体病情还是非常平稳的。针对不同年龄段的患者救治,我们在诊疗方案当中专门进行了分类诊疗方案的制定。比如,针对儿童我们有儿童的诊疗方案;针对有基础性疾病、老年这些高危因素的,也有相应的诊疗方案的要求,为医疗救治提供规范化的指引。刚才记者也提到了,像郑州儿童病例比较多,其实在前不久,福建莆田的儿童病例也比较多,针对儿童病人的特点,一是治疗手段和药物剂量不同于成人,二是大部分儿童相对症状比较轻,多数是轻型和普通型,因此在治疗过程中,我们专门派出儿科的专家进行指导,同时当地也专门组织了儿童的医护团队来承担儿童诊疗的具体工作。在儿童诊疗工作中,我们一方面是对症支持,另外一方面是保持充足的休息以及营养配餐,我们特别注重对儿童的照顾和心理的支持。对于有一些症状的,比如发热、咳嗽,我们一般优先选择中成药来改善孩子的症状。为了加强对患儿的人文关怀,我们特意在整个治疗中,比如有一些同班的孩子,尽量把他们安排在一起。比如有的是家庭聚集性的,建立家庭病房,这样的话给孩子最大化的人文关怀。我在莆田的时候遇到一例,老师和孩子都是阳性病例,我们有意安排班主任老师和孩子都在一个病房,给孩子最有效的心理支持。但有一些孩子没有相应的同伴或者家人,我们都专门安排了专业的医护团队来负责照顾孩子的起居,同时给他们最大化的心理关怀。对于老年人,特别是有一些基础性疾病的人,我们都及时派出了非常有经验的专家团队,第一时间赶到定点医院,指导当地的医护团队按照“一人一策”、多学科诊疗,对患者提供支持。所以在治疗过程中,一方面是多学科,另外一方面是及早对有重症倾向的患者进行重点管理,同时还加强预警指标的监测,最大化把措施实施在患者转重或者转危之前,也就是关口前移,给予患者最好的治疗。所以整体来讲,我们在治疗上,无论是对儿童还是对老人、有基础疾病的人,整体的治疗都是非常平稳的,效果也是非常好的,所以才有了在比较短的时间内有60多例患者已经转轻或治愈出院。从救治方面来讲,我们积累了一定的经验,在同质化、规范化诊疗方面,效果还是不错的。谢谢。中央广播电视总台cgtn记者:目前,全球疫情包括周边国家疫情还在持续加大,我们边境口岸城市面临的疫情防控压力也在持续加大,请问海关制定了哪些措施来做好疫情防控工作?谢谢。海关总署卫生检疫司司长林伟:谢谢您刚才的提问。就像您刚才提到的,当前我国周边国家疫情形势严峻复杂,海关总署坚持“外防输入、内防反弹”总策略,按照国务院联防联控机制要求,部署全国海关毫不放松抓好陆路边境口岸疫情防控工作,坚决把疫情防控的各项措施落实落细落到位。一方面,我们严格落实陆路边境口岸“外防输入”各项政策措施,成立专项工作组,持续监测周边国家疫情发展态势,做到“一日一研判”。陆路边境口岸海关根据通关需求等实际情况,不断完善疫情防控工作方案和应急预案,做到“一口岸一方案”。陆路边境口岸海关坚决落实“客停货通”“人货分离”等防控政策,推动地方实施“甩挂”“接驳”“吊装”等非接触式货物交接模式。对入境人员严格“三查三排一转运”等措施,完善对跨境司机、边民等高风险人群疫情防控工作链条,与地方联防联控机制无缝衔接,严格做到闭环管理。同时,我们也坚持人、物、环境同防,按照国务院联防联控机制工作方案,在口岸环节严格做好进口冷链食品和高风险非冷链集装箱货物的抽样监测检测和预防性消毒监督工作。严格落实国务院联防联控机制关于口岸高风险从业人员的管理要求,严格实施“两点一线”“14+7+7”等封闭管理措施,始终保持海关口岸一线人员疫苗接种全覆盖,并持续推进加强免疫,从严、就高做好安全防护工作。另一方面,我们也加大对陆路边境口岸海关的支持力度,加强疫情防控和应急处置能力。在硬件方面,我们加强负压隔离室、快速检测实验室、p2实验室等设施的改造和提升,推动陆路边境口岸检测能力大幅度提高;加强移动p2实验室储备,做好在应急状态下驰援陆路边境口岸的准备。在人员方面,我们做好海关疫情防控人员“一线、预备、应急”三级梯队建设,确保在口岸突发公共事件发生时能够第一时间从周边海关抽调专业人员支援陆路边境口岸有关防疫工作。在经费、物资保障方面,我们继续加大对陆路边境口岸疫情防控经费倾斜力度,确保防控物资充足,全方位提升陆路边境口岸海关疫情防控能力和应急处置能力。谢谢。财经杂志财经大健康记者:刚才提到全国迎来了新一轮降温,可能会给疫情防控增加难度。想请问一下我们在冬春季疫情防控和新冠疫苗接种方面有哪些工作?谢谢。吴良有:谢谢这位记者朋友。正像您提到的,近期全国多个地区出现了大幅度降温,给核酸检测、流调排查、社区管控等疫情防控工作带来了难度。不少专家也研判,今年冬春季的疫情防控形势较去年将更为复杂。当然,我们在成功处置国内聚集性疫情的过程中,也积累了很多好的经验和做法,今年冬春季疫情防控将重点围绕“早、小、严、实、准”五个方面开展工作。一是要抓“早”。坚持早发现、早报告、早处置,这是疫情防控的关键。要保持重点人群的“应检尽检”和发热门诊哨点的灵敏性,提高疫情监测的敏感性,发现报告的时效性以及应对处置的及时性。一旦发现本土聚集性疫情,迅速调集核酸检测、流调溯源、医疗救治等队伍赶赴现场,指导处置工作,赢得疫情防控的先机。二是要抓“小”。国家卫生健康委将会同有关部门指导各地按照“从严从紧”的原则,全面梳理风险点,结合自身实际,细化完善防控工作实施细则,对于意想不到的情形,要求地方要及时报告、及时处置,不放过任何风险环节,不放过任何可能的疑点。三是要抓“严”。要严格按照技术规范组织开展入境人员的管理、闭环转运、隔离观察、核酸检测以及物品环境消毒,进口冷链食品管理等重点环节的工作。对于高风险人群,要严格实施闭环管理,加密开展核酸检测,坚决杜绝疫情的风险外溢。四是要抓“实”。医疗机构、旅游景点、交通场站、餐饮单位、宾馆酒店等公共场所要落实好查码、测温、戴口罩等要求,对于已经赋黄码、赋红码的人员,既要动员群众自觉落实防疫措施,更要发挥好各基层社区还有公共场所验码查码的作用,排查到位、管控到位,坚决杜绝“脱管”“漏管”的情况发生。五是要抓“准”。在快速处置疫情的同时,我们要突出精准科学,更加精准地判定密接和次密接,划定风险区域。在隔离管控时,对于风险人群要完善赋码解码规则,做到“快赋快解”。在区域协查时,要科学界定好时空关系、风险等级,避免发生“误伤”的情况。在服务保障时,要提供更有针对性地服务和关怀,着力提高群众的满意度,努力以最小的成本取得最大的防控成效,尽最大可能减少对经济社会的影响。关于新冠病毒疫苗接种工作,根据我们今年下半年新冠病毒疫苗接种的安排,还有冬季疫情防控工作需要,将继续推进重点人群的疫苗加强免疫和3—11岁人群的新冠病毒疫苗接种工作,对重点人群要实现“应接尽接”。目前,3—11岁人群已经接种了8439.5万人,加强免疫已经接种4944万人,我们将力争在12月底完成3—11岁人群的全程接种工作。同时,指导各地合理安排资源,统筹做好流感等呼吸道疫苗的接种工作,降低呼吸道传染病和新冠肺炎叠加流行的风险。各地也在结合实际情况,创新服务模式,合理设置接种单位,做好恶劣天气下的接种安排,方便群众接种。在这里也提醒大家,尽量提前预约接种,减少现场等待的时间,接种时合理增加衣物,注意防寒保暖,希望大家能够继续支持疫苗接种工作。谢谢。新华社记者:我的问题和校园疫苗接种有关,随着我国启动3—11岁儿童的新冠病毒疫苗接种,现在疫苗接种已经覆盖大、中、小学等所有符合接种条件的学生。请问,学校怎么配合做好宣传引导工作?谢谢。王登峰:感谢记者的提问。刚才您也说到了,大、中、小学正在按照国家的统一部署,稳步推进新冠疫苗的接种工作。目前,18岁以上的学生新冠疫苗接种已经在95%以上。刚才吴局长介绍,3—11岁的孩子已经接种了8千多万,1.6亿的3—11岁的孩子已经有一半开始接种了,所以这是一个很好的成绩。从新冠肺炎疫苗的接种,特别对于3—11岁以及11—18岁这个年龄段的孩子来讲,我们和国家整个疫苗接种的方针是一样的,就是以知情、自愿和同意为前提。所以从学校来讲,要做的工作有以下几方面。第一是要让所有的师生,包括学生的家长要“知情”。知情就是要通过科普宣传,让所有的学生和家长了解新冠肺炎疫苗的安全性、有效性以及个人接种疫苗对整个学校、家庭、个人的保护作用。第二是要求学校要积极配合做好新冠肺炎疫苗接种的各项组织和后勤保障工作。特别对于未成年人来讲,新冠肺炎疫苗的接种要由监护人陪同,如果有些地方要在校园里实施疫苗接种,学校要做好这方面的后勤保障工作。第三是对于儿童青少年,接种疫苗对他们来讲可能是一件很让人害怕的事情,所以从教育系统来讲,要通过学校对孩子进行心理疏导,减轻他们对接种疫苗的恐惧。我们经常看到有的孩子打一个疫苗会哭半天,从学校来讲,其实可以通过心理辅导去帮助学生,使这些儿童青少年减轻焦虑和紧张,这也是从学校来讲,配合的一个非常重要的方面。最后,对于儿童青少年的接种疫苗,要给予学生家长更多的自主选择机会。如果学生和家长在知情、自愿、同意的情况下,学校要配合他们做好接种疫苗整个过程的服务和保障工作,让青少年能够安全、自愿地接受新冠肺炎疫苗。谢谢。中央广播电视总台央视社会与法频道记者:疫情防控可以说是不见硝烟的战场,其中医务人员是距离危险最近的人,在本轮疫情中已经发现有多名医务人员确诊。请问,医务人员在工作当中应该如何做好个人防护?国家卫生健康委近期采取了哪些措施来强化院感防控及定点救治医院的管理工作?此外,甘肃省此前有3名卫校学生在救援一线核酸采样时被感染,这种情况如何避免?谢谢。郭燕红:谢谢这位记者的提问。正像这位记者所提的那样,医务人员由于每天要和患者接触,从事医疗服务的整个过程,是职业暴露的高风险人群,也是发生感染的高风险人群。因此,我们高度重视医务人员预防和控制感染的各项工作,包括院内交叉感染的预防和控制工作。在医务人员的预防感染过程中,我们强调四个方面。第一,要完善制度。各个医疗机构从管理到临床一线,要建立一系列的预防和控制医院感染的规章制度。第二,细化技术规范。对于临床当中的一些操作,包括工作流程,都需要有一系列的技术指南和规范来进行指引。第三,加强全员培训。医院感染的预防与控制涉及整个工作过程以及医疗机构的各个环节,所以全员的培训,特别是对一线医护人员的培训非常重要。让他们在工作中能够自觉执行和落实相应的操作规范。第四,加大监督、指导、检查的力度,针对薄弱环节、针对问题不断进行改善。大家也注意到,作为新冠病毒特别是变异的德尔塔毒株,其传染性非常强,而且病毒载量特别高。医务人员长期在一线工作,发生职业暴露的风险也高,所以有一些医疗机构发生了医务人员的感染。我们针对凡是因相关规章制度没有落实发生医务人员感染的医疗机构,发现一起通报一起,在全国进行通报,让其他的医疗机构从中汲取教训,引以为戒、举一反三。在落实相关预防和控制医院感染过程中,定点医疗机构是其中一个重要环节,因为定点医疗机构主要是负责确诊病人的收治工作,所以医院感染工作就更为重要。我们对定点医疗机构首先是落实投入的责任,对医院感染的防控,建筑布局、通道以及房间的设置,都需要有硬件的投入。所以,在这方面我们要求地方要选择综合能力强,并且能够达到医院感染防控要求的医疗机构作为定点医院。我们对定点医院有一揽子的评估要求,地方卫生行政部门要按照评估要求选择符合条件的定点医院。其次,加大对所有医务人员,包括在一线工作的其他专业人员的闭环管理。在闭环管理当中,确保所有的医务人员的健康监测到位,并且加密核酸检测,最大化甄别和发现潜在感染的风险。三是加大对所有定点人员上岗前的培训。所有的医务人员在上岗前都要经过规范培训,经考核合格方能上岗。同时,在培训过程中,我们着重对防护物品的使用、防护技术的应用等方面进行精心安排。刚才记者提到,有些地方出现了在核酸采样过程中使用非卫生专业技术人员,有的还是卫校的学生,在这点上,其实我们在文件中都已经进行了规定。因为核酸采样以及核酸检测,专业性和技术性比较强,还涉及生物安全问题,因此我们要求非卫生专业技术人员是不能够直接从事核酸采样和检测工作的,只有医生和护士等专业技术人员才能够做这项工作,而且在工作过程中要遵循相关技术规范、指南要求,确保安全,防止交叉感染。谢谢。香港经济导报记者:请问对于商场、超市、影剧院等室内空间应采取哪些消毒措施,以防范疫情交叉传播?谢谢。张流波:谢谢,这个问题也是大家所关注的。商场、超市都和老百姓的日常生活密切相关,所以在低风险地区,还是应该正常营业。作为顾客,这些地方是要去,但是我们可以尽量减少去的机会和时间,进去是买东西,不是逛商店。商场、超市、影剧院这些室内公共场所,要加强防控工作,至少应该注意以下七个方面的问题。第一,对重点部位、重点物品,要加强消毒。如购物车、购物篮应该是用一次消毒一次,循环消毒。像门帘、电梯按钮、自动扶梯、柜台台面等地方应该增加清洁消毒频次。地面、墙壁这些地方要定期做好消毒工作。第二,关于中央空调。不管是全空气系统,还是风机盘管+新风系统,都应该使用空气净化消毒装置,对回风进行消毒处理,否则应该采用全新风模式。单纯用最大新风量运行的,只是不具备条件的一个过渡阶段,应该尽早用全新风,或者对回风进行消毒以后再运行。第三,服务人员应该全程接种疫苗,应该有健康申报制度、体温检测制度,要及时发现可疑的症状。第四,对顾客应该进行健康扫码登记,便于追溯。应进行体温监测制度,尽早识别可疑感染者。在购物时应该保持一米以上的距离。哪怕是过秤、交款、排队的时候,都应该保持一米以上距离。第五,在付款时应该尽量选用非接触的电子付款方式。第六,不管是顾客还是工作人员,都应该戴好口罩、做好防护。同时,要做好手部卫生。第七,如果发现了可疑病例或密切接触者,应该及时向当地疾控部门报告,配合疾控部门采取相关的防控工作,在他们的指导下做好流调、隔离、消毒工作。谢谢。南方都市报记者:请问在这次的新冠肺炎病例中,中医药发挥了什么样的作用?国家在中医药协同治疗方面有哪些安排?谢谢。郭燕红:谢谢这位记者的提问。确实,在这次新冠肺炎患者的救治工作中,中医药发挥了非常重要的作用。在这个过程中,我们的中医专家边救治边总结,筛选出了一批有效的方药,既有通用方,也有针对不同病情、不同症型的方剂,同时还有中成药。在治疗过程中,体现了辩病辩证的统一。一是对于轻型和普通型患者用药,以中医药治疗为主,特别是在改善患者的发热、咳嗽、纳差、乏力等临床症状中,发挥了很好的作用。在这个过程中,中西医之间密切结合,西医方面,更多给予患者氧疗,对症支持,减少轻型、普通型向重症的转化。二是对于重症患者来讲,中医药发挥了很好的作用,中西医结合在一起,通过使用一些中医药,在退高热、促进肺部渗出的吸收等方面,能够起到非常好的作用。三是对于康复的患者,往往是肺部渗出有明显改善,没有特别的发热、咳嗽症状,加上两次核酸检测阴性,基本上患者就可以治愈出院。但往往患者还是有一些不太舒服,比如乏力、纳差、气虚等。在这些方面,中医药在促进患者的康复方面,也可以发挥非常好的作用。此外,针对无症状感染者,包括在隔离点集中隔离的密接、次密接人员,指导各地根据气候和人员体质不同来进行中医药的预防治疗。大家可以看到,从预防一直到轻症的治疗,重症的救治以及康复整个全过程,中西医结合、中西药并用,在这个过程中,我们建立了“四有”的机制,就是在定点医院当中,第一要有团队,要有中医的团队;第二要有机制,就是中西医协同的机制;第三要有措施;第四是有成效。这个过程中我们还建立了“四个联合”,第一是中西医联合组成国家级专家组;第二是在制定和完善诊疗方案中,中西医专家联合在一起,对诊疗方案进行不断完善和修订;第三是对一线的救治工作进行指导会诊。刚才良有也提到,只要疫情一发生,我们派出多个队伍,其中一个队伍是医疗救治队伍。而医疗救治队伍在派出过程中,也是既有西医中的重症、呼吸、感染等专家,也有中医的专家,联合赴一线,对一线救治工作进行联合指导和会诊。第四是在救治过程中,一线的团队也专门有中医的医务人员,中西医结合在一起,共同为患者提供救治。所以,在整个患者救治过程中,全程都体现了中西医结合、中西药并重的原则,整体效果是非常不错的,在这方面,我们积累了非常好的经验。其实不光是在新冠肺炎的救治当中,在其他疾病的救治当中,中西医结合也是非常重要的。谢谢。中国教育电视台记者:我们注意到,本轮疫情在北京、河南郑州等地报告的病例当中都有中小学生,所以想请问,教育部门对此采取了哪些防控措施,如何避免疫情在校园内的传播呢?谢谢。王登峰:感谢记者的提问。对于中小学出现新冠肺炎疫情,首先要启动新冠肺炎疫情防控的应急机制。这是我们对所有学校的基本要求,各地各校其实已经做了充分的准备,宁可备而不用,也不可用时不备。应急预案首先就是要做到对涉疫的师生进行救治,同时对环境进行消杀,还要启动对相关密接者和次密接者隔离的问题,这些都要按照技术方案去严格落实。在采取完这两项措施之后,紧接着从对学校正常教育教学秩序来讲,如果需要停课,还要启动在线教学的方案。也就是说,如果学生不能够到校学习,特别对中小学生来讲,他们要回到家居家,这时候的在线学习就显得特别重要。而且在在线教育实施过程中,还要在在线课程中增加指导学生如何在家度过隔离的时期。除了上好文化课之外,体育课、艺术课、劳动课等,也要通过在线的方式,让孩子们能够在紧张学习之余还能够像在校园一样,参加到相关的体育艺术活动中去。同时,也要给学生们提供一定的心理辅导和引导。如何防止疫情传入校园或者传出,我刚才已经回答了。目前,从整个学校的疫情防控来讲,我们本着“三严”的原则,一是严格防止疫情进校园,就是在校门管控和师生的健康监测、健康管理方面采取的相应措施。二是校内要严格落实技术方案,就是要做好各项疫情防控的措施。三是,如果学校涉疫之后,不管是隔离还是在线教学,都要确保不要由校园再作为一个新的传染点引向校外,这也是涉疫学校疫情防控工作中特别关注的一个问题。前几天大家可能在新闻里看到了,一个学校有一个学生是密接者,当学校了解这个情况之后,立即要求当时在校内的所有师生都要留在校内,组织进行全员核酸检测。在核酸检测结果没有出来之前,校园里只许进不许出。从校园来讲,一旦学校涉疫,除了要防止新冠肺炎疫情在校内传播之外,还要考虑不能因为学校里的师生外出给社会带来新的威胁。这是我们对涉疫学校所采取的一系列措施。其他学校也要严格按照属地和相关疫情防控的要求,做好落实。谢谢。人民日报记者:现在快递已经成为我们日常生活中不可缺少的一部分了,尤其是“双十一”刚过,正是集中收发快递的时候,很多人会关注,收发快递是否存在传播新冠病毒的风险以及我们应该如何防范这类风险?谢谢。张流波:谢谢这位记者。快递现在大家比较关注,关于快递传播新冠病毒,应该同时满足这几个条件:第一,在收运快递的过程中被新冠病毒污染。第二,我们在收快递的时候,快递物品上面的新冠病毒还存活。第三,我们在接收快递时,受到新冠病毒的污染。所以,预防快递传播新冠病毒,也要从这三个方面着手。第一,设法避免污染:如中高风险地区暂停快递业务,暂不收取高风险人群、发热病人交寄的快递;快递员要加强健康管理,确保不被感染,不带病上岗;快递转运途中要做好保护,包装不直接暴露在外。第二,在收递快件后,集中分拣环节由快递公司对快递表面进行消毒处理。第三,我们在收快递时做好适度防护,戴口罩、手套,人员保持一米距离等。快递的表面包装要求不带入室内,确要带入时可以采用消毒湿巾六面擦拭消毒或进行喷雾消毒等。当然,要强调一点,我们处理完快递后一定要做好手部卫生。谢谢。米锋:由于时间关系,请大家提问最后两个问题。红星新闻记者:此前,国务院联防联控机制医疗救治组印发了《关于进一步强化当前新冠病毒核酸检测服务的通知》(以下简称《通知》),各地要在近期内对核酸检测工作各项要求落实情况再部署、再检查。如今《通知》已经发布了半个多月了,请问针对《通知》中提到的各项要求,各地的核酸检测机构落实情况如何?另外,当前多地出现了散发疫情,请问现在各地的核酸检测能力是否充足?能否满足“应检尽检”和“愿检尽检”人群的需求?谢谢。郭燕红:谢谢这位记者的提问。核酸检测是我们落实“四早”的关键措施。10月22日,国务院联防联控机制医疗救治组专门对全国有关加强核酸检测服务这项工作进行了再部署、再要求。从文件发布以后到现在,各地做了大量工作,在有关能力建设、合理布局、提高效率、优化服务等方面多措并举。第一,加强了核酸检测机构的合理化布局。进行网格化管理,让老百姓能够就近寻求到核酸检测服务。在这个过程中,各地纷纷用各种形式进行社会公开,有的是在网站上公开了机构的名称、地址、服务时间,向公众告知。有的采用了地图、电子导航技术,让老百姓了解核酸检测机构的分布,就近得到核酸检测服务。第二,优化了核酸检测服务。比如,很多机构都开展了线上预约服务,同时延长了检测的时间,拉长了班次,有的还增加了检测的号源,满足老百姓“应检尽检”“愿检尽检”的要求。特别是很多机构都开展了24小时的检测服务,最大化满足人民群众核酸检测的需求。第三,大大缩短了结果反馈时间。对于重点人群,我们已经实现了6小时以内反馈核酸检测结果。对于“愿检尽检”的人群,部分地区已经实现了6小时以内出具检测结果,而且有些地方通过线上的手段,能够让大家在手机端,甚至在健康宝上就能够及时查到检测结果,而且还能够打印检测报告。第四,不断提升核酸检测的质量。核酸检测这项工作技术性很强,因此为保证检测质量,每一个核酸检测机构都要加强室内的质控。同时,我们通过国家临检中心和省级临检中心,对每一个开展核酸检测的机构进行了室间质评,像国家的质评,今年已经做了9次,并将检测结果及时反馈到相应检测机构。省内也加大了室间质评的频次,最大化保证核酸检测的质量。我们都知道,一旦发生疫情,各地都第一时间启动全员核酸检测,力争在最短时间内锁定感染范围,同时加快有关疫情防控的各项措施。我们要求500万以下人口的城市,要在两天以内完成全员核酸检测;500万以上人口的城市,要在三天以内完成全员核酸检测。各地要按照上述要求对核酸检测能力储备、采样人员安排、实验室检测安排、样品转运安排等做出预案。一旦发生疫情,启动全员核酸检测过程中,势必会有一些城市、地区的核酸检测能力一时不能满足需求,我们会启动省内及省外调集力量的机制,最大化地支持和满足疫情发生地全员核酸检测的需求。同时,还有一项工作非常重要,就是信息化的支持。我们正会同相关部门对核酸检测信息系统进行评测优化,一旦发生疫情,在启动全员核酸检测的过程当中,用以对采样、转运、检测、信息反馈全流程提供信息化支持。通过信息化的手段,在提高效率的同时,也能够提高整个核酸检测过程的协同性,并实现精准的结果反馈。谢谢。中国青年报记者:目前疫情发生区域学校已经停课,是否会考虑像2020年春季学期一样全面开展线上教学?受目前疫情影响,很多家长在讨论,今年学生特别是大学生会提前放寒假吗?谢谢。王登峰:感谢这位记者的提问。从涉疫学校和个别疫情反复比较大的地方,目前确实已经开始中小学的停课。出现疫情的个别高校也进行了封闭式管理,采取在线教学的方式就显得尤为重要,但还没有必要全面开展线上教学。目前的情况只是对涉疫学校和需要暂停上下学的地方及时启动在线教学。经过这两年,我们对疫情防控已经积累了非常丰富的经验,根据疫情防控的要求,随时可以启动各级各类学校的在线教学,这方面的资源是非常充足的。我们经过这两年努力,在线教学的资源和课程设置,都已经做得非常周到了。在线课程不仅仅是文化课,还包括体育课、艺术课、心理辅导、疫情科普知识等。现在到了冬季,很多地方已经开始谋划寒假的安排。实际上从今年10月份教育部就发出通知,要求各地各校根据疫情防控的要求、属地政策安排、学校的学习情况、课程进展情况等及早谋划今年寒假的安排。从目前来看,我们还是要按照这样的总基调来推进。特别是北方天气比较寒冷,寒假时间比较长,可能有些学校已经开始在策划了。是否提前放寒假,第一是要看疫情形势的发展,第二是要根据属地对疫情防控措施各方面的要求,既包括疫情防控的举措,也包括一旦放寒假,高校学生可能要离开当地回乡,要同时考虑高校所在地和生源地两个地方疫情防控的要求。我们要根据各地各校的实际情况,鼓励所有的高校在属地管理的前提下,结合校园防控的要求以及课程进展的情况、学习安排的情况,由各地各校进行自主决定。我们也希望大家都关心和支持疫情防控工作,对于提前放假或者推迟放假的情况,都应该理解和支持。谢谢。米锋:谢谢王登峰先生。今天的发布会,几位嘉宾为我们介绍了当前疫情防控形势和医疗救治的一些情况,还介绍了学校等重点场所的疫情防控、疫苗接种等情况,也给我们交流了一些消毒的常用知识,再次感谢各位嘉宾。后续我们还将继续举办新闻发布会,欢迎大家继续关注。今天的发布会到此结束,谢谢大家。"}
{"id": 325, "category": "summarization", "type": "Academic Article", "lang": "en", "task": "[Instruction] Summarize the following academic article: \n since the introduction of the gunn - peterson ( gp ) test by @xcite , a detailed knowledge about the physical state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) has been gained from the study of the absorption features identified in the spectra of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) at restframe wavelengths @xmath4 , which are now known to be mainly due to resonant scattering by intergalactic neutral hydrogen randomly distributed along the line - of - sight , as first proposed by @xcite . for instance , the null result in the search for a gp trough has been used to rule out the existence of a hot intercloud medium ( icm ) @xcite , which was thought to confine by pressure the ly@xmath2 clouds @xcite . as a result of detailed analyses of the line statistics of the absorbing material , a wealth of information on its clustering ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) , in particular the existence of voids ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and the evolution of its number densities , column densities , and doppler parameter with redshift ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) has accumulated over the past years . these results , in combination with the use of state - of - the - art numerical simulations of structure formation based on the currently accepted paradigm of the concordance cosmology @xcite , show that the features seen in absorption against bright background sources arise when the line - of - sight intersects the structures that naturally emerge and evolve with time under the influence of gravitational attraction . different types of structures such as the filaments present in the _ cosmic web _ , galactic haloes , and even the discs of primeval galaxies , give rise to distinct absorption features attributed to entities known historically as ly@xmath2 forest clouds , lyman limit systems ( llss ) , and damped ly@xmath2 absorbers ( dlas ) ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for excellent reviews , respectively ) . nevertheless , the relation between the observed absorption features and the objects causing them , in particular the correlation between observed damped absorption lines , metal lines ( _ e.g. _ mg ii , o vi ) and galaxies  the so - called absorber - galaxy connection  is still a matter of debate ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * part 1 ) . as a consequence of numerous efforts over many years , we now have a better understanding of the origins of the different absorption features observed in qso spectra . in particular , the notion of discrete , intervening hi absorbing systems randomly distributed along the line - of - sight has been embedded into the more general picture of an evolving _ continuous _ intergalactic medium with a hi density field that varies in space and time , with its evolution driven mainly by the hubble expansion , the radiation field of ionising uv sources , and the collapse of structures due to gravity .      over decades many people have been working hard towards inferring the physical properties of the intergalactic medium such as its chemical content , density , temperature , etc . ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) by measuring the type of transition , strength , number density , and profiles of absorption lines imprinted in the spectra of qsos and , more recently , of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? . there has also been a great effort to quantify the effect of the absorption due to intergalactic neutral hydrogen on the photometric properties of background sources . as a matter of fact , several models have been developed in order to account for this so - called intergalactic attenuation , with different approaches and purposes . @xcite used monte carlo simulations to estimate the amount of absorption at wavelengths shorter than the redshifted heii @xmath5 line , in order to test the feasibility of the equivalent of the gunn - peterson test for intergalactic helium . they found that the absorption as a function of wavelength , averaged over many lines - of - sight , should display together with a characteristic stair - case profile due to the cumulative absorption at the hi resonant wavelengths , an additional characteristic valley - shaped feature ( the  lyman - valley  ) due to the cumulative effect of the photoionisation of hi by photons with energies @xmath6 , where @xmath7 . later on , in a seminal paper @xcite developed an analytical method to quantify the opacity due to intergalactic hi as a function of redshift , and its effect on the colors of high - redshift galaxies . the underlying assumption of this model is that the observed flux of a source at redshift @xmath8 is given by the product of the _ intrinsic _ flux and a transmission factor that accounts for the _ mean _ absorption as a function of wavelength given in the form @xmath9 ( see * ? ? ? * their equation 3 ) , where the brackets denote the average over an ensemble of random lines - of - sight . the most common application of this model consists in correcting the flux of a synthetic ( galaxy- , qso- ) spectrum for intergalactic absorption . this correction is of particular importance at high redshift , where intergalactic hi severely absorbs the light of a background object at restframe wavelengths shorter than @xmath10 , leading to a substantial reddening of its colour ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? as the numerous references in the literature attest , the @xcite model has become the most widely used attenuation model . however , in a later work ( * ? ? ? * from now on bcg99 ) argued that it is not possible to estimate the mean change in the magnitude of a source at a given redshift due to absorption by intergalactic hi along the line - of - sight by multiplying the mean transmission curve of @xcite s model with the spectrum of the source and integrating over the corresponding passband , mainly because of the existence of color terms . they suggested that the correct way of accounting for the mean effect of hi absorption on the spectrum of a background source and on its photometric properties is to model first the absorption along many random lines - of - sight , compute the desired photometric quantities for each one of them , and _ then _ compute the average over the ensemble of lines - of - sight . in other words , they argue that the processes of averaging over many random lines - of - sight and measuring photometric quantities are non - commutative . indeed , they showed using a monte carlo technique that the average magnitudes computed following their approach substantially differ from those computed using @xcite s model , even when using the same input distributions for the number of absorbers , their column densities and doppler parameters . the approach proposed by effectively mimics the measurement process that would take place if one would determine _ e.g. _ the mean observed brightness of a collection of galaxies with different absorber populations along their particular lines - of - sight , but otherwise identical in their intrinsic properties ( spectrum , morphology , etc . ) , and is hence physically meaningful . it turns out that features such as the characteristic stair - case profile and the lyman - valley can not possibly be observed in a _ spectrum , since they arise only by averaging over sufficient numbers of lines - of - sight , a process that has no physical meaning . in a more recent paper , @xcite developed a method to compute the opacity due to intergalactic hi by using hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation in the framework of the concordance @xmath11cdm cosmology performed by @xcite . applying their model to compute broad - band magnitudes for different types of objects ( _ e.g. _ starburst galaxies , qsos of type i and ii ) , @xcite reports differences of 0.5  1.0 mag with respect to @xcite s model . despite the different results obtained , this model is similar to @xcite s model in the sense that it implicitly assumes that the mean opacity of the igm along a random line - of - sight due to the presence of hi can be accounted for by multiplying a given input spectrum with a mean attenuation curve of the form @xmath12 and integrating over the corresponding filter function ( see * ? ? ? * their equation 8) . following , we state that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the intrinsic flux , @xmath15 is the filter transmission function , and the brackets denote the average over all lines - of - sight . we consider that the operation implied by the right - hand side of this expression is the correct way of estimating mean magnitudes of background objects including the effect of the absorption due to intergalactic hi . this approach is of course not restricted to the computation of mean magnitudes and colors , and can be applied to the estimate of the mean of any photometric quantity . furthermore , it is also possible to determine not only the mean , but in principle any desired confidence interval around the mean , _ e.g. _ @xmath16 range , via the computation of quantiles ( see section [ sec : res ] ) . it should be clear that not only the method , but also the input physics is an ( even more ) crucial ingredient of a particular model that accounts for the intergalactic attenuation , as already shown by . it is , however , not trivial to test whether using a particular method and a set of input distributions accurately describes the observed effect of the absorption by intergalactic hi on the spectra of background sources . for example , the evolutionary synthesis models of @xcite that include the correction for intergalactic absorption based on @xcite s model match quite well the observations of galaxies in the hubble deep field ( * ? ? ? * their figure 12 ) , since the magnitude differences reported by ( their figure 7 ) for one of their models with respect to @xcite s model are in this case of the order of the scatter of the observations around the predicted colors . in other words , even though @xcite s and s approaches are fundamentally different , it is difficult to test the accuracy of their predictions on the basis of a comparison to _ e.g. _ observed galaxy colors . a quantity that is more sensitive to the absorption due to intergalactic hi is the mean cosmic flux decrement @xmath0 ( cf . section [ sec : cfd ] ) . the reason for this is that the restframe wavelength range over which this quantity is measured is typically @xmath17 wide , and is hence narrower than typical broadband filters . we thus consider as a primer test that any model that accounts for the absorption due to intergalactic hi should reproduce first of all the observations of this quantity . hence , through the comparison of their respective predictions to measurements of @xmath0 it should be possible to discriminate between different models which may or may not be appropriate to account for the effect of the intergalactic attenuation on the spectra of background sources . we select for this comparison two of several models introduced by to compute the magnitude changes of high - redshift galaxies due to intergalactic absorption , and which are based , respectively , on the input distribution functions of @xcite , and the input physics of the @xcite approach . the latter is chosen since , as already mentioned , it is the model most widely used in the literature ; the former constitutes , to the best of our knowledge , the most complete set of input distribution functions for the evolution of the ly@xmath2 absorbers to date , later expanded but not significantly changed by @xcite . + to sum up : the main goal of this work is to model and analyse the redshift evolution of @xmath0 for different evolution scenarios of the intergalactic neutral hydrogen , conveniently parametrized by input distribution functions of the form of equation ( [ eq : ddf ] , section [ sec : cfd ] ) . hence , the models we consider here differ only by the set of input distribution functions used , but they all equal in method , _ i.e. _ all of them take advantage of the monte carlo technique . we judge the goodness of a particular model by its power to reproduce the observations of @xmath0 in a wide redshift range , and analyse to which extent the theoretical expectations about the properties of @xmath0 are recovered from the measurements . this work is organised as follows : in section [ sec : cfd ] we briefly recall the concept of the cosmic flux decrement and discuss some issues related to its measurement . in section [ sec : mod ] we present two different types of models for the intergalactic attenuation , which we use to model the redshift evolution of the cosmic flux decrement . in section [ sec : mda ] , we describe our measurements of this quantity for a sample of sdss qso spectra . finally , we compare these and previous measurements to the outcomes of each model , and discuss the results of this comparison as well as some other implications of the models for the evolution of @xmath0 in section [ sec : res ] . before high - resolution ( _ i.e. _ @xmath18 ) , high s / n observation became feasible , the basic spectroscopic technique used to analyse the effect of the absorption due to intergalactic neutral hydrogen on the spectra of background sources was to measure the mean depression of the observed flux relative to the unabsorbed flux or emission continuum , a quantity which became to be known as cosmic flux decrement . this quantity , first introduced by @xcite , can be defined as a function of redshift by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the continuum and the observed fluxes , respectively , and . formally , the integral is computed in the restframe wavelength range , _ i.e. _ between the ly@xmath22 and the ly@xmath2 emission lines . however , the actual estimate of @xmath0 is usually performed between the restframe wavelengths and or in an even narrower wavelength interval in order to avoid contamination by the emission wings of the ly@xmath22 + ovi and ly@xmath2 lines , respectively . since @xmath0 is extremely sensitive to @xmath20 , as can be easily seen from the definition ( [ eq : cfd ] ) , an accurate measurement of this quantity demands a reliable estimate of the underlying continuum . unfortunately , there is no consensus of what the best method to estimate the continuum may be . a popular choice , mainly because of the presence of emission lines redward of the ly@xmath2 forest region , consists in fitting a local continuum , most commonly using cubic splines ( see _ e.g. _ * ? * ) or b - spline functions ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , searching for regions apparently free of absorption blueward of the ly@xmath2 emission line . other authors prefer to fit a continuum in the region redward of the red wing of the ly@xmath2 emission line , and extrapolate it to the region blueward of it @xcite . a widely adopted form for the fitted continuum in this case is a power - law with spectral index @xmath23 which for wavelengths @xmath24 takes on values in the range ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . the latter method may tend to place the intrinsic continuum level higher than it actually is , thus overestimating the measured values of @xmath0 ( cf . [ sub : con ] ; see also * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; for the former method the opposite is true , in general ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) . for either method , there is an uncertainty in the estimate of the continuum , and this is the main drawback of the mean flux depression as a technique to estimate the mean absorption due to neutral hydrogen present in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . in an attempt to overcome this problem , @xcite used the idea that the cosmic flux decrement effectively measures the _ total _ equivalent width of all ly@xmath2 absorption lines in the chosen wavelength range if corrected for the contribution of metal absorption lines to measure this quantity by simply adding up the equivalent widths of lines identified as ly@xmath2 absorption lines . of course , the reliability of this technique highly depends on the correct identification of lines , and misidentification may lead to larger uncertainties than those associated to the continuum estimate . it turns out that reliable measurements of @xmath0 are very useful to constrain estimates of fundamental cosmological parameters such as the mean baryon density @xmath25 , the uv background intensity @xcite , the normalization of the power spectrum @xmath26 , the vacuum - energy density @xmath27 , and the hubble parameter @xmath28 @xcite . it is hence of great interest to contrast observations to theoretical models of the evolution of @xmath0 , in which the bias due to the uncertainty in the estimate of the continuum is absent . this has been previously done by different workers ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , usually obtaining a good agreement with observations . however , there is still a scatter in the observations of this quantity for which it has not been accounted yet in any modelling so far . it is possible that this scatter may well be due to the difference in the methods used by each group to measure @xmath0 and to the different redshift ranges probed . hence , by taking advantage of the monte carlo technique , we assess to which extent the _ observed _ scatter can be ascribed to the _ intrinsic _ scatter in @xmath0 due to fluctuations in the properties ( number density , column density , doppler parameter ) of the hi absorbers along different lines - of - sight ( see section [ sec : sca ] ) . from the theoretical point of view , assuming that the restframe equivalent width of the absorbers does not evolve with redshift , and that the number density of the absorbing systems evolves like @xmath29 , it is expected that @xmath0 should evolve with @xmath8 like @xmath30 where the extra factor @xmath31 comes from the scaling of the equivalent width , as pointed out by @xcite . indeed , it has been found empirically that the redshift evolution of @xmath0 can be described by a power law with @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite , even though other functional forms , _ e.g. _ an exponential of the form with @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite also match well the observations . more recently , @xcite showed that the observed evolution of @xmath0 with redshift in the range @xmath36 is well described by a broken power - law , even though the significance of the fit is low . in any case , expressions like these are only valid up to a given redshift , since they diverge for @xmath37 , whilst @xmath0 converges asymptotically to 1 in this limit or , more precisely , when z approaches the redshift @xmath38 at which reionisation sets on . as will be shown later , the redshift evolution of @xmath0 predicted by our simulations does satisfy this asymptotic behaviour ( cf . section [ sec : res ] ) . furthermore , even if the power - law form for the evolution of @xmath0 holds , the index @xmath39 in equation ( [ eq : pwl ] ) should be replaced by @xmath40 , where the latter index accounts for the averaged evolution of absorbers of different column densities , which evolve all at different rates . conversely , estimates of a single @xmath39 from @xmath0 measurements assuming a power - law of the form of equation ( [ eq : pwl ] ) , as done by @xcite , may give a hint on the population of absorbers _ dominating _ the behaviour of @xmath0 , comparing the estimated @xmath39 with the power - law index of the different populations . for instance , according to one of the models considered here , the redshift evolution of @xmath0 will be shown to be dominated by absorbers with column densities @xmath41 . + a compilation of @xmath0 measurements , accumulated in the literature over the past twenty years approximately , and which includes our own measurements that extend the redshift range to @xmath42 , is shown in figure [ fig : daz ] ( cf . section [ sec : mda ] and cited references for details on the measurements in this figure ) . since the observation of individual sources ( galaxies , qsos , grbs ) necessarily implies observations along different lines - of - sight , it is expected that the stochastic nature of the distribution of the ly@xmath2 absorbers , especially of those with the highest column densities , causes a scatter in the observed absorption , even for sources with identical intrinsic spectra . hence , depending on the absorption along a particular line - of - sight , one would expect different observed values for each measurement of any photometric quantity , for example , the cosmic flux decrement @xmath0 . performing enough measurements of such a quantity for sources with ideally identical seds at a fixed redshift , one could in principle estimate its mean and its scatter due to stochastic effects in the absorption by neutral hydrogen in the igm . the numerical realisation of this thought experiment is best achieved through monte carlo simulations . following _ @xcite , and , we generate thousands ( @xmath43 ) of lines - of - sight each with a random population of hi absorbers , and compute the absorption along each of them for a given input spectrum at a fixed redshift . the population of each line - of - sight consists of a random number @xmath44 of absorbing systems , each of them characterized by three parameters : its redshift @xmath45 , its column density @xmath46 , and its doppler parameter , where @xmath47 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath48 is the kinetic temperature of the gas and @xmath49 is the mass of the hydrogen atom . the redshift and column density characterising each absorber are drawn from a distribution of the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a normalization constant . this function defines the 1-dimensional distribution of the hi present in the igm probed by a random line - of - sight . the number @xmath52 of systems for each line - of - sight is drawn from a poisson distribution with parameter @xmath53 where the integral is carried out over appropriate redshift- and column density intervals @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . + we use different sets of input distributions that include the evolution of both low- and high density absorbers , and that give rise to the following models :    @xmath56 }   &   \\mathcal{n}_{\\,0 }   &   \\gamma   &               \\beta\\\\              \\noalign{\\smallskip }              \\hline              \\noalign{\\smallskip }              10^{\\,12 } \\ -

ground state to the next higher energy level ) be identified with i = 2 , the ly@xmath22 transition with i = 3 , etc . the photoionisation cross - section is thus consistently denoted by @xmath74 . ] . in general , the absorption coefficient for the transition @xmath75 is @xmath76 the cross - section @xmath77 is a function of the doppler parameter @xmath57 , the oscillator strength of the transition @xmath78 , and the resonant wavelength @xmath79 , and is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the doppler broadening , and the variable is the distance to the line center in doppler units . we assume the profile function @xmath82 of the absorption line to be given by the voigt - hjerting function @xmath83 here , is the relative strength of the natural broadening to doppler broadening for the @xmath84th transition , and is the kinetic velocity in units of the doppler parameter . in this work , we neglect the opacity due to the photoionisation term and consider only the first resonant transition , _ i.e. _ the ly@xmath2 transition , since this is the only one of interest in the wavelength range studied here . furthermore , we use the approximation to @xmath85 for values of @xmath86 and column densities characteristic for intergalactic hi of @xcite . the cumulative absorption along a random line - of - sight of the flux @xmath88 of a source at redshift @xmath89 is calculated according to expression @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the observed and the emitted wavelengths , respectively . these are related by . the quantity @xmath87 is the transmission factor and

@xmath95 is the redshift at the epoch of absorption , and @xmath77 and @xmath96through the dependence on the doppler parameter  in equation ( [ eq : tau3 ] ) are different in general for each absorber . however , we do not write this explicitly by _ e.g. _ introducing a new subscript in order to avoid a cumbersome notation . ] . introducing the relation @xmath97/(1+z)$ ] , it follows from equations ( [ eq : cfd ] ) , ( [ eq : fobs ] ) , and ( [ eq : msk ] ) that @xmath98 the right  hand side of this expression is just wavelength - averaged value of @xmath87 at redshift @xmath8 , and we will denote it by @xmath99 . note , however , that this quantity still depends on redshift , as indicated by the subscript . since @xmath100 and @xmath99 differ only by a constant factor , they may be considered as equivalent with respect to their statistics , which will be discussed in the next section . judging from the dependence of @xmath87 on @xmath94 and @xmath52 ( see equation [ eq : msk ] ) , it is expected that the transmission factor and consequently @xmath0 are rather complicated random variables . nevertheless , as is well known from statistics , a random variable @xmath101 that can be expressed as the product of a large number of small , statistically independent factors is distributed lognormally , _ i.e. _ according to the distribution @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the mean and the standard deviation of @xmath105 . this expression is equivalent to the statement that a random variable @xmath101 is distributed lognormally , if and only if its logarithm is distributed normally . the expected value @xmath106 and the standard deviation @xmath107 of a lognormal distributed quantity can be expressed in terms of the parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 as @xmath108 and @xmath109 from the form of equation ( [ eq : msk ] ) we may suspect that the transmission factor is a lognormally distributed variable , since it can be expressed as the product of a large number of statistically independent factors that take on values in the range @xmath110 $ ] . the implications of this statement are profound : if @xmath87 is distributed lognormally , so does @xmath99 and consequently @xmath100 . furthermore , due to the property of the lognormal distribution stated above , the effective optical depth of the ly@xmath2 absorption , usually defined as @xmath111 ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) should obey a gaussian distribution . this result follows independently from the fact that the total optical depth can be expressed as the sum of the independent contribution of each system , as indicated in equation ( [ eq : msk ] ) . thus , for a sufficiently large number of absorbers @xmath44 , and if the optical depth for each absorber has the same mean value @xmath112 and dispersion @xmath113 at each wavelength ( _ i.e. _ redshift ) , @xmath114 should obey a gaussian distribution at each redshift , centered at @xmath115 and with a dispersion @xmath116 . these statements are completely independent of the form of evolution of the intergalactic neutral hydrogen , as long as the transmission factor can be expressed in the form of equation ( [ eq : msk ] ) . in order to test whether the values of @xmath0 obey a lognormal distribution , we compute @xmath0 using the mmc and bmc models for an ensemble of @xmath117 lines - of - sight at a given redshift , and from these values we compute the mean and standard deviation of @xmath118 according to the equations @xmath119 and @xmath120 with these parameters , we generate for each redshift a set of normally distributed random numbers using a standard random - number generator , and compare them statistically to the @xmath118 values from our simulations at each given redshift , in order to determine whether the latter are normally distributed . recall that @xmath118 is distributed normally if and only if @xmath0 obeys a lognormal probability distribution . as a first approach , we choose to compare both data sets via a @xmath121-test similar method , and to this end we compute for each set of values the 50 per cent quantile ( median ) , and the @xmath122 , and @xmath123 per cent quantiles around the median . we define the following measure    @xmath124    where the @xmath125 s are the quantiles determined from the set of random numbers distributed normally , the @xmath126 s are the corresponding quantiles of the @xmath118 values at a given redshift that result from our simulations , and @xmath127 is the number of quantiles . by definition , @xmath128 explicitly gives the absolute deviation of one data set as characterised by these 11 quantiles with respect to the other data set , and thus quantifies the departure of the assumed distribution . indeed , the smaller the value of @xmath128 , the larger the probability that both data sets belong to the same parent distribution . the values of @xmath128 computed in this way turn out to lie in the range @xmath129 , which may seem vanishingly small . however , since the distribution of the random variable @xmath128 itself is unknown , we determine the significance of the results by generating two sets of normally distributed random numbers with mean and standard deviations distributed uniformly , and comparing them to the values found for our simulated data . we do this for @xmath130 pairs of sets , and determine from these what is the fraction of realisations with a value of @xmath128 smaller than a given value . according to these estimates , there is a probability of @xmath131 that a value @xmath132 will be produced by chance , respectively . in figure [ fig : del ] we show the values for @xmath128 as a function of redshift for the full mmc model , assuming a lognormal parent distribution for @xmath0 ( heavy solid line ) . the result are qualitatively the same for the bmc model and are not shown for clarity . note that for the whole redshift range shown , @xmath133 , and in particular @xmath134 for @xmath135 . it follows from the central limit theorem that the larger the number of absorbers @xmath52 , the closer the approach of the distribution of @xmath87 to a lognormal distribution , since the distribution of @xmath136 approaches a gaussian . given that @xmath52 increases with redshift , it should be expected that the accuracy with which the distribution of @xmath87 approaches a lognormal distribution also increases with redshift . furthermore , if the integral in equation ( [ eq : cfd2 ] ) is approximated by a sum of the form @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the number of pixels , it is apparent that for a sufficiently large @xmath138 , and assuming that @xmath87 has the same mean value @xmath139 and dispersion @xmath140 at each pixel , the distribution of @xmath99 should approach a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath139 and dispersion @xmath141 . since the width of a given restframe wavelength range , _ i.e. _ the number of pixels also increases with redshift as @xmath31 , it is expected that the approximation of the distribution of @xmath99 and hence of @xmath0 to a gaussian becomes better with increasing redshift . we thus have the superposition of two effects : on the one hand , the distribution of @xmath87 at a fixed wavelength approaches a lognormal distribution at any given redshift , with the accuracy increasing with redshift . on the other hand , the distribution of @xmath99 and @xmath142 approaches a gaussian distribution with increasing redshift . the net result should be that @xmath99 and @xmath0 are distributed lognormally at low redshifts , and that their distribution approaches a gaussian for higher redshifts . since @xmath0 asymptotically converges to unity for very high redshifts , its distribution at these redshifts is expected to be highly peaked around the mean value . this is naturally given by the fact that the dispersion of @xmath99 scales like @xmath141 around @xmath139 , and that @xmath138 increases with redshift , as stated above . in order to test this expectation , we compute the analytical lognormal ( gaussian ) probability distribution of @xmath0 as given by equation ( [ eq : log ] ) with the mean and standard deviation of @xmath118 ( @xmath0 ) computed using equations ( [ eq : mea ] ) and ( [ eq : std ] ) from the ensemble of values that result from our simulations at each redshift . the comparison of the analytic distribution thus obtained to the distribution of simulated @xmath0 values is shown for the full mmc model in figure [ fig : fdd ] . the results for the bmc model are qualitatively the same and are hence not shown . note the excellent agreement at all redshifts between the lognormal probability distribution and the distribution of the @xmath0 values resulting from our simulations . we want to emphasize that the curves shown are not fits to the binned data , but are computed using only the mean and standard deviation of the unbinned data . at lower redshift , the agreement at the lower cut - off , _ i.e. _ at @xmath143 is worth mentioning . it is remarkable that this cut - off , which is physically given by the fact that absorption as measured by @xmath0 can not take on values smaller than zero , arises in a natural way due solely to the fact that @xmath0 is distributed lognormally . note , in contrast , that a gaussian distribution does not satisfactorily describes the distribution of the data at these low redshifts ; in particular , the gaussian distribution does not display the sharp cut - off at @xmath143 . nevertheless , the description of the data by a gaussian distribution becomes better with increasing redshift , as expected , and also the corresponding gaussian distribution becomes narrower at every increasing redshift ( taking into account the change in the scale of the @xmath144-axis from the first to the last panel ) . moreover , note that the analytic lognormal and gaussian distribution become visually indistinguishable from each other at @xmath145 . in order to assess quantitatively the differences between these distributions with respect to the distribution of the data , we compute again the value of @xmath128 at each redshift , assuming now that the @xmath0 values obtained from the mmc model are drawn from a gaussian parent distribution . we compare these values to the corresponding values computed before for an assumed lognormal parent distribution . this comparison is shown in figure [ fig : del ] . as can be seen , the values of @xmath128 for both distributions are low at all redshifts , and the difference between them at @xmath146 is negligible small . this explains why the lognormal and gaussian distribution functions shown in figure [ fig : fdd ] are practically indistinguishable from each other . however , note that the values of @xmath128 for a assumed gaussian parent distribution become vanishingly small with increasing redshift , eventually becoming smaller than the corresponding values for the lognormal distribution . besides , it can be see also that the @xmath128 values for a assumed lognormal distribution rise again towards high redshifts , implying that the distribution of the data at these redshifts is no longer well described by a lognormal distribution.this confirms our statement made above , that @xmath0 is expected to be distributed lognormally at low redshifts and normally at higher redshifts . the redshift at which the transition from a lognormal to a gaussian distribution takes place may depend on the particular set of input distributions used . for redshifts where the distribution of @xmath0 is well approximated by a lognormal distribution , the optical depth should be distributed normally . this result is however not in agreement with the results from _ * his figure 1 ) , ( * ? ? ? * their figure b1 ) , or ( * ? ? ? * their appendix c ) , where the distribution of the mean flux , _ i.e. _ the averaged transmission factor @xmath99 is claimed to be highly inconsistent with a gaussian distribution . it is usually assumed that the presence of the high - density lyman limit systems is responsible for this behaviour , and we next make use of our simulations to address this question .      in order to quantify the effect that the llss have on the distribution of @xmath0 , we compare , following the analysis of section [ sec : dda ] , the results of the simulations for the mmc model with and without the optically thick llss . we find that @xmath0 is lognormally distributed as well with a high confidence for the case where the llss are excluded , as can in figure [ fig : del ] , where the values for @xmath128 computed at each given redshift are shown . again , the results for the bmc model are qualitatively the same and are omitted here . note that the values of @xmath128 for the mmc model without llss are larger at redshifts @xmath147 than those for the full mmc model . this is due to the fact that the absence of the optically thick llss enhances the probability of the attenuation factor @xmath148 to be closer to unity at a given wavelength along a random line - of - sight . this means effectively that the number of factors in equation ( [ eq : msk ] ) are reduced . hence , when the llss are absent , the approach to a lognormal distribution should be worse with respect to the case where the llss are included . furthermore , this effect should be enhanced towards lower redshifts , for which the number of factors , _ i.e. _ of absorbers decreases as @xmath149 . note that the trend is the opposite in the case of a assumed gaussian parent distribution . we hence find when computing the evolution of @xmath0 with the mmc model with and without llss that the predictions for the evolution of @xmath0 with redshift for the full mmc model are practically indistinguishable from the results of the mmc model without llss , which implies that the effect of these systems on the total absorption is small . furthermore , it turns out that the distribution of @xmath0 is lognormal irrespective of the presence of llss . all these results point to the fact that the lls have a negligible impact on the evolution of @xmath0 , as long as the input distributions used here correctly describe the number density evolution of the absorbers . this would confirm similar results already found by @xcite . also , as pointed out by @xcite , the picture would not be fundamentally different if higher column density systems such as damped ly@xmath2 systems were present . we will come back to this point in section [ sec : res ] . + we think that , as long as the distribution functions realistically describe the evolution of the ly@xmath2 absorbers , the llss _ can not _ truly have a great impact neither on the absorption as measured by @xmath0 , nor on its statistics because of the following reasons : 1 ) they are scarce , and even more compared to the thinner ly@xmath2 forest systems ( _ e.g. _ of the order of 5 llss on average along a random line - of - sight compared to approximately @xmath150 ly@xmath2 forest absorbers out to @xmath151 , according to the mmc model ) ; 2 ) their contribution to the absorption is due solely to the absorption at the resonant wavelength of the ly@xmath2 line , and the equivalent width of the ly@xmath2 absorption line arising in systems with column densities @xmath152 is not too different from that of the systems with column densities @xmath153 ( cf . the curve - of - growth in figure [ fig : cog ] ) , which are by far more numerous . in order to estimate the relative contribution of each population at a given redshift , we weight the equivalent width @xmath154 of the ly@xmath2 absorption line as a function of the column density @xmath138 and doppler parameter @xmath57 with the column density distribution , and compute the ratio @xmath155 where @xmath156 here , @xmath157 is the distribution function of population , @xmath158 is the rest equivalent width of a ly@xmath2 absorption line for a column density @xmath138 and doppler parameter @xmath57 , and @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the column density limits that define each population , respectively . for a reasonable value for the doppler parameter of @xmath161 , and the input distributions of the mmc model , we find that @xmath162 at all redshifts . the result is qualitatively the same for the bmc model . hence , it follows from these models that the ly@xmath2 forest systems dominate the absorption over the optically thicker lyman limit systems at all epochs . this would explain at least in part why the difference between the predictions for @xmath0 from the mmc model with and without llss , is small . also , it is consistent with the theoretical expectation that the distribution of @xmath0 should not be far from lognormal or gaussian , with or without llss , since this only depends on the fact that the absorption factor be expressed in the form of equation ( [ eq : msk ] ) , and this is truly independent of the form of the input distributions , as stated previously . we expect the intrinsic scatter in the absorption due to cosmic variance to be strongest at lines - of - sight of middle length . at low redshifts , both the number of thin ly@xmath2 forest clouds and thick lyman limit systems is small , and the addition of a few more does not change dramatically the amount of absorption . however , the mean number of ly@xmath2 forest clouds and lls increases with @xmath8 , and thus the probability of encountering more or less systems than average increases as well . correspondingly , the absorption increases and so does its scatter . at even higher redshifts , the number of ly@xmath2 forest systems increases so dramatically and the absorption is so severe that the addition of more systems does not make any difference neither to the absorption nor to the scatter . thus , we should expect the stochastic effect , _ i.e. _ the scatter in absorption , to peak at some intermediate redshift @xmath163 . we compute the intrinsic scatter at the @xmath104 level for the values of @xmath0 at each given redshift obtained from our simulations using equations ( [ eq : mul ] ) , ( [ eq : sdl ] ) , ( [ eq : mea ] ) , and ( [ eq : std ] ) . the result is shown in figure [ fig : sca ] , where we show the evolution of the scatter in @xmath0 with redshift for the mmc model with and without llss . we also include for comparison the result from the bmc model . it can be seen that , irrespective of the model , the scatter peaks at a intermediate redshift between @xmath164 and @xmath165 . note that the peak is significant , since it represents an increase in the scatter of 2.5 times with respect to its value at @xmath166 . it is interesting that this result had also been found by ( * ? ? ? * their figure 2 ) , who using a semi - analytic approach and different input distributions , reported that @xmath167 is largest at redshifts near 3.7 . thus , the qualitative behaviour of the intrinsic scatter of @xmath0 shown in figure [ fig : sca ] may be an unavoidable feature of this observable , which could explain at least in part the large scatter in the measurements of @xmath0 seen in the same redshift interval ( cf . figure [ fig : daz ] ) . as will be shown in section [ sec : res ] , however , there is a disagreement at the @xmath168 level between the _ amplitude _ of the scatter in the observations at these redshifts and that predicted by the models . when comparing models that only differ by the presence of the optically thick lyman limit systems , we find that the scatter in @xmath0 is larger at any given redshift when the lls are present , as expected . none the less , the absolute value of the scatter does not differ significantly between the situation where these systems are present and where they are absent . thus , the net effect of the llss is to enlarge the intrinsic scatter in the absorption , contributing only marginally to the mean value of the absorption itself . however , note that for redshifts @xmath169 , the amount of scatter at the 1@xmath104 level becomes indistinguishable between both scenarios , owing to the fact that the thinner ly@xmath2 forest systems are overwhelmingly more numerous at these redshifts .    the results stated above are consistent with the previous conclusion obtained from our simulations that the optically thick llss can not have a great impact on the absorption as measured by @xmath0 and on its scatter . we want to compare the predictions for the evolution of @xmath0 that result from the models described above to observations . for this purpose , we use previous measurements of @xmath0 reported in the literature , and we perform ourselves new measurements of this quantity , using qso spectra from the sdss data release 5 @xcite , thus extending the redshift range of the measurements to @xmath42 . our selection procedure of sources suitable for this purpose was as follows : since the wavelength range available from sdss ( dr5 ) is @xmath170 { \\ , \\mathrm{nm}}$ ] , and we measure the continuum depression @xmath0 in the restframe wavelength interval @xmath171 { \\ , \\mathrm{nm}}$ ] , the redshift of our sample is restricted to @xmath172 . we choose @xmath173 as our lowest redshift in order to avoid the low s / n at the blue end of the spectrograph . a simple query for high - z quasi - stellar objects on the sdss skyserver spectroscopic query form with this restriction alone returns around 2400 spectra . from this first selection , we rejected those objects for which the redshift was either not measured , the measurement had failed , or the measured photometric and spectroscopic redshifts were inconsistent with each other . we binned the quasars in redshift intervals of @xmath174 and selected for each redshift bin the spectrum with the highest s / n , leaving us with 28 sources , from which we removed three further objects due to low data quality . the resulting sample is listed in table [ tab : qso ] . the continuum of a quasar is often assumed to be of the form ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , or equivalently , , where both indices are related by , and , and @xmath175 is the speed of light . empirical evidence in favour of the assumption of an underlying continuum in form of a power - law has been given by _ @xcite , who derived an average power - law index of @xmath176 for and @xmath177 for . this is consistent with the result already found by @xcite that the spectral index @xmath178 varies over large wavelength ranges . @xcite found by constructing a composite qso spectrum from 284 hst fos spectra that a single power - law describes well the continuum for wavelengths between 105 and 220 nm with @xmath179 , but that the continuum steepens ( flattens in @xmath180 ) significantly for @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) . similarly , @xcite reported , using a sample nearly twice as large as the @xcite s sample , that the continuum in the extreme uv region between @xmath183 and @xmath184 and in the near uv between @xmath185 and @xmath186 is well described by a single power - law with @xmath187 and @xmath188 , respectively . furthermore , by constructing a composite qso spectrum from a homogeneous sample of over 2200 sdss qsos , @xcite concluded that the continuum in the rest - frame wavelength range @xmath189 can be very well modeled by a single power - law either in wavelength or frequency , with @xmath190 . however , they did not estimate a spectral index for wavelengths @xmath191 . while it is the consensus that the optical / nir continuum of quasar spectra is due to synchrotron emission @xcite , the physical origin of the quasar uv / optical continuum is not yet established . on the hand hand , the observed soft x - ray / uv / optical spectral shape of quasars is found to be consistent with free - free emission of optically thin gas at temperatures @xmath192 k @xcite , which is well described by a power - law . on the other hand , it has been argued that the emission from a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk also reproduces well the observed quasar sed in this spectral region @xcite . either model , however , is consistent with an underlying continuum in the form of a power - law . alternatively , as already mentioned in section [ sec : cfd ] , other authors prefer to fit quasar continua locally using spline functions ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) searching for regions apparently free of absorption blueward of the ly@xmath2 emission line . since the ly@xmath2 forest region is severely absorbed due to intervening hi systems , especially for high - z qsos , and a local fit to the continuum in this region is difficult , with the uncertainty increasing with redshift ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) , we choose to estimate the continuum of our selected sources in the ly@xmath2 forest region by fitting a power - law to the qso spectrum redward of the ly@xmath2 emission line and extrapolating it for @xmath193 . as long as the assumption of the underlying power - law holds , this approach has the advantage that the continuum estimate is completely independent of the spectral resolution and s / n in the ly@xmath2 forest region . nevertheless , this method may lead to an systematic overestimate of the continuum flux and thus to an corresponding overestimate of @xmath0 . it follows from the results quoted above that the quasar s intrinsic continuum in spectral regions below and above the ly@xmath2 emission line may both be well described by power - laws , but with potentially different spectral indices . more specifically , the spectrum in the region below 121.6 nm ( rest - frame ) may be steeper in frequency , and hence flatter in wavelength , which implies @xmath194 . ] , with respect to the continuum in the region above 121.6 nm ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * their figure 4 ) . thus , fitting a continuum in the form of a power - law at wavelengths @xmath24 and extrapolating it towards @xmath191 may well lead to an overestimate of the continuum level in that region , as first pointed out by @xcite , according to whom the @xmath0 may be overestimated by at least 0.05 at @xmath195 . we will take this systematic bias into account when estimating the uncertainty in our @xmath0 measurements ( cf . section [ sub : dam ] ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : qso ]    the designation of each object meets the iau nomenclature , as required . for details on the official sdss designation of an object , please consult www.sdss.org/dr5/coverage/iau.html    the power - law that we fit to each spectrum is of the form @xmath196 where the flux amplitude @xmath197 , the wavelength off - set @xmath198 , and the spectral index @xmath178 are the parameters to be determined . we fit the continuum in the wavelength range , in order to avoid the red emission wing of the ly@xmath2 line and the red end of the spectrograph , respectively . note that the available wavelength range decreases with redshift , and this may introduce an increasing uncertainty in the fitted continuum . the fit parameters and their uncertainties were obtained with help of the idl task curvefit . it turns out that the continuum fit is rather insensitive to the uncertainties in the flux amplitude and the wavelength off - set , and extremely sensitive to the uncertainty in the spectral index . because of this and for simplicity , in our further analysis we neglect the error in the first two parameters and consider only the uncertainty in the spectral index to be of relevance . an example of a qso spectrum and its corresponding fit are shown in figure [ fig : qso ] . the spectral index and its uncertainty for each source are listed in table [ tab : qso ] ( columns three and four , respectively ) . the uncertainty in the spectral index quoted in column four and denoted by @xmath199 includes the formal error inherent to the fitting process , which is due to the error in the detected flux , the removal of broad emission lines in the region @xmath200  which makes the wavelength range become patchy  , and the systematic uncertainty due to the decreasing available wavelength range with redshift mentioned above . the systematic effect of the latter in particular can clearly be seen on the overall trend for the uncertainty in the spectral index to increase with redshift .      for each qso spectrum , we compute the _ total _ absorption pixel by pixel in the restframe range @xmath201 { \\ , \\mathrm{nm}}$ ] according to the expression ) . ] @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the total number of pixels between and . the lower limit of this range is chosen as to avoid the wings of the ly@xmath22 + ovi emission lines , while the upper limits is such that the blue wing of the ly@xmath2 emission line is excluded in the computation of @xmath0 . the measurement of @xmath0 for each source together with its corresponding uncertainty are listed in table [ tab : qso ] ( column five ) . there are two independent sources of uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath0 : 1 ) the error in the spectral index inherent to the continuum fitting , _ i.e. _ @xmath204 , and 2 ) the possibility that the continuum level may have been systematically overestimated due to the change in slope of the power - law at @xmath205 ( cf . section [ sub : con ] ) . we shall refer to the uncertainty in @xmath0 due to the first and second sources @xmath206 and @xmath207 , respectively . the total uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath0 quoted in column five of table [ tab : qso] is then assumed to be given by @xmath208 . as a consistency check , we adopt two different methods to estimate @xmath209 . the first method assumes that the @xmath210 range for each measurement is given by , respectively , for the corresponding values of @xmath211 listed in table [ tab : qso ] . the second method is based on error propagation , according to which the error @xmath212 in the estimate of a quantity @xmath213 , which depends on @xmath214 independent random variables @xmath215 , each with an uncertainty @xmath216 , is given by @xmath217 in the case of our measurements of @xmath0 , only the uncertainty in the index @xmath178 is relevant , and hence equation ( [ eq : err ] ) becomes , with the appropriate notation , @xmath218 where we have used equations ( [ eq : pow ] ) and ( [ eq : daz ] ) . note that we do not include the term due to the error in the detected flux @xmath21 , since this is already included in @xmath219 . the error computed according to the first method is asymmetric , as expected , while the error computed using equation ( [ eq : err2 ] ) approximately ( in some cases exactly ) corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the former . since the error estimates computed according to both these methods are consistent with each other , we may use either to estimate the uncertainty in @xmath0 due to the uncertainty in the continuum fit ; we choose to use the values computed according to method 1 , which are listed in table [ tab : qso ] ( column six ) . it is not clear based on the results found in the literature ( cf . section [ sub : con ] ) whether the continuum blueward of ly@xmath2 may _ always _ be overestimated when assuming it to be described by an extrapolation of the power - law redward of ly@xmath2 . however , we will assume that this is the case in order to allow for the possibility that our @xmath0 measurements may have been systematically overestimated . in order to compute the corresponding uncertainty in @xmath0 , we make the following assumptions : first , the continuum in the region blueward of ly@xmath2 shall be described by a power - law as well , but with a smaller spectral index  _ i.e. _ the continuum is _ flatter _  with respect to the region redward of ly@xmath2 . since it is not possible to fit a power - law in this regime for the data we use , we assume that both power - laws ( above and below ly@xmath2 ) are normalised at @xmath205 . furthermore , and for simplicity , we take the difference in the spectral indices below and above ly@xmath2 to be equal 1 ( which corresponds roughly to the findings in the literature quoted in section [ sub : con ] ) . under these assumptions , the value of @xmath0 for our sample turns out to be overestimated on average by less than ten per cent . this value is slightly lower for our measurement of @xmath0 at @xmath220 than the correction estimated by @xcite . however , they also remark that the exact value of the bias depends on the particular method applied to extrapolate the continuum in the ly@xmath2 forest region . we hence make the rather conservative assumption that each measurement of @xmath0 has an additional uncertainty @xmath221 of ten per cent , and add this uncertainty only to the _ low _ error bound , since we are assuming that the continuum , and hence @xmath0 , may have been _ _ over__estimated . we could in principle correct our @xmath0 estimates by shifting all measurements by ten per cent towards a lower value , but since it is not clear whether the continuum has been overestimated for _ every single _ measurement , we prefer to express this bias as an uncertainty . the uncertainty @xmath222 for each measurement is listed in the last column of table [ tab : qso ] . note that we do not correct our measurements for contamination of metal lines . however , this should not introduce a large error , since their contribution is small . for example , @xcite find that they contribute by @xmath223 per cent to the total absorption at @xmath224 . the validity of this assumption will be tested in the next section by the comparison of @xmath0-measurements to the results of our simulations , in which the absorption due to metal lines is not included . we compute the evolution of @xmath0 in the redshift interval @xmath225 using the models mmc ( with and without lyman limit systems ) and bmc presented in the section [ sec : mod ] , which include the effect of different populations of absorbers , _ i.e. _ ly@xmath2 forest clouds and lyman limit absorbers . for comparison , we include also the values of @xmath0 computed using @xcite s model ( see section [ sec : rev ] ) . we refer to this model as mtc . for the mmc ( with and without lls ) and bmc models , we simulate an ensemble of @xmath117 lines - of - sight at fixed redshift , and compute for each of them the flux decrement @xmath0 according to equation ( [ eq : daz ] ) . in this way we get for each given redshift an ensemble of an equal number of @xmath0 values for each model , from which we estimate the 50 per cent quantile ( median ) , and the @xmath122 , and @xmath123 per cent quantiles around the median , which correspond to the @xmath226 and @xmath227 ranges . we do not compute the mean and @xmath104 ranges in the standard way , since the distribution of @xmath0 is strictly speaking unknown a priori . however , according to the results from section [ sec : mod ] , the distribution of @xmath0 is not too far from a lognormal or even a gaussian distribution ; hence , the identification of mean with median , of @xmath16 range with the @xmath228 quantile around the median , and so on , is justified . since the mtc model only provides a ( mean ) transmission function at each redshift , we compute for this model one single value for @xmath0 at each redshift by numerically integrating the corresponding transmission function in the restframe wavelength range @xmath229 { \\ , \\mathrm{nm}}$ ] . we compare our simulations to measurements of @xmath0 accumulated in the literature over the past two decades , performed with different methods and approaches . this compilation is by no means intended to be complete . the reason for choosing these measurements is mainly that they were performed in more or less mutually exclusive redshift ranges which all together cover the range @xmath230 . our measurements extend this redshift range out to @xmath42 . therefore , these previous measurements together with our own allow a comparison to the models presented here over a wide redshift range , but with the caveat that using measurements from different groups may introduce an artificial bias in the evolution of @xmath0 due to the differences in the particular method used and the different redshift ranges probed in each case , as previously mentioned . the literature data and our measurements are shown together with our model calculations in figure [ fig : daz ] ( see cited references for details on the corresponding measurements ) . as can be seen in this figure , the predictions for the evolution of the mean @xmath0 from all three models , mmc , bmc , and mtc , are practically indistinguishable from each other when compared to observations for redshifts @xmath147 . we do not include in this figure the predictions for @xmath0 based on the mmc model without llss , since the difference between this and the full mmc model is negligible . at higher redshifts , the values of @xmath0 obtained from the mmc and mtc models match the observations quite well . note that in spite of the fundamentally different approaches and input physics of these models , their results are very similar . as a result , it is not possible yet to discriminate between these models due to the uncertainty and the strong scatter in the observations , especially around @xmath164 ( cf . section [ sec : sca ] ) . in contrast to the mmc and the mtc models , the predictions from the bmc model strongly deviate from the measurements of @xmath0 at @xmath231 , _ underestimating _ the absorption . since the mmc and bmc models differ only in terms of the input distributions and not in terms of the method , this result suggests that the evolution of the ly@xmath2 absorbers implied by the input distributions of the bmc model is slower than expected from the evolution of @xmath0 ( cf . equation [ eq : pwl ] ) . if used to compute the magnitude changes for high - redshift galaxies due to intergalactic absorption as done by _ e.g. _ , the difference in the predicted evolution of @xmath0 between the mmc and bmc models corresponds to a difference of slightly more than 0.6 mag in the predicted magnitude change for _ e.g. _ an sd - type galaxy with a constant star formation rate at @xmath232 in the f450w filter . the corresponding difference between the mmc and mtc model amounts to less than 0.3 mag . it is worth mentioning at this point that , in contrast to previous models ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) , we explicitly avoid normalising in any way the used distributions to match the observed @xmath0 at some given redshift , or manipulating the models whatsoever to satisfy any other restriction . we simply take the distributions as reported in the literature , where they were determined directly by means of line statistics by the authors and references therein . we mention this in order to emphasize the rather good agreement between the observations and the evolution of the mean @xmath0 predicted by all three models at @xmath233 , and by the mmc model at higher redshifts , further reinforced by the similarity between the results of the mtc and the mmc models , which are completely independent from each other . we include in figure [ fig : daz ] the empirical fits of @xcite of the form @xmath234 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 and of @xcite of the form @xmath235 with @xmath236 and @xmath237 . these empirical fits match the observations quite well at @xmath238 , and may be useful as a rough estimate of the mean absorption at those redshifts . however , as stated before , they should be taken with caution , especially at high redshifts . while @xmath0 asymptotically converges to unity as the redshift approaches the epoch of reionisation , @xmath239 , these empirical fits diverge . in contrast , the predicted evolution of @xmath0 from all models described above does satisfy the expected and observed asymptotic behaviour . the rate of convergence to this limiting value certainly depends on the particular set of input distributions used , as shown by the comparison between the mmc to the bmc model . in general , the stronger the number density evolution , the faster the convergence . in other words , different input distribution functions imply different values for @xmath38 , and this information may be used as a further constraint on the accuracy of a particular set of input distributions . extending the computations of the evolution of @xmath0 with the mmc model to redshifts @xmath240 , it turns out that @xmath0 is almost unity at @xmath241 . this value is slightly higher than the value of 6.5 quoted by @xcite for the epoch of reionisation . the compilation of @xmath0 measurements shown in figure [ fig : daz ] displays a large scatter at all redshifts , in particular at redshifts @xmath231 . previously , concerns were raised about the possibility that the amplitude of the intrinsic scatter due to cosmic variance may be enhanced by combining measurements performed with different methods and using heterogeneous data samples . hence , we select a subset from our compilation following the criteria stated below , and compare this observations to the scatter as predicted by our simulations . the results of this comparison are summarised in figure [ fig : daz2 ] . here , we show the redshift evolution of @xmath0 as computed from the mmc model . we include the 50 per cent quantile , _ i.e. _ the median , and the @xmath228 , and @xmath123 per cent quantiles , which correspond to the @xmath242- , and @xmath227 ranges around the median at each redshift . again , the difference between the predictions of the mmc with and without llss is negligible , and thus we show only the results for the full mmc model . we do not include the bmc model in this analysis in view of the disagreement with the observations at redshifts @xmath231 . our new data subset consists of our own measurements together with the measurements of @xcite , who use power - law fits to estimate the continuum level of the quasars , and of the measurements from @xcite , who fit the continuum locally using b - splines . we select these measurements for the following reasons : @xcite s data allow a more direct comparison to our data due to the similarity in method to estimate @xmath0 ; @xcite s data are the most recent and accurate measurements of @xmath0 available to date . furthermore , these data sets individually cover the largest redshift ranges , and together they constitute the smallest set of individual measurements fully spanning the redshift range @xmath243 with some overlap . within the quoted uncertainty , the observations are well matched by the evolution of @xmath0 as predicted by the mmc model in the redshift range @xmath244 , with the exception of some outliers around @xmath245 , where the scatter of our observations alone as well as the scatter in the full sample of measurements is large , as can be seen in figure [ fig : daz ] . it is apparent from figure [ fig : daz2 ] that the largest scatter in the observed values of @xmath0 at a given redshift can not be ascribed to the _ intrinsic _ scatter in the absorption due to variations from one line - of - sight to another as computed with the mmc model , not even at the @xmath246 level . nevertheless , note that this is only the case for @xcite s and our measurements , while @xcite s measurements are all nicely contained within the @xmath227 envelope of the model . this suggests that the observed scatter or at least part of it is not real , but only an artifact introduced by combining observations based on different methods to measure @xmath0 . this assumption is supported by the small amplitude of the scatter in the distribution of high - redshift galaxy colors already found by ( cf . their figure 6 ) for a variety of input distribution functions . also , the fact that @xcite s measurements are well matched by the mmc model points to the fact that the particular method chosen by @xcite and ourselves to estimate the continuum in the ly@xmath2 forest region does introduce a bias in the measurements of @xmath0 . on the one hand , there is very likely a bias do to the already discussed systematic overestimate of the continuum level . furthermore , neither @xcite nor we corrected our corresponding measurements for metal - line absorption . these facts together would explain in part why precisely our and their measurements are higher on average than the median value of @xmath0 predicted by the mmc model , as can be seen in figure [ fig : daz2 ] . even though its effect is expected to be small , including the absorption of metal lines should eventually increase the agreement between the results from the models and the observations . there is thus rather strong evidence that most of the amplitude in the observed scatter in @xmath0 displayed in figures [ fig : daz ] and [ fig : daz2 ] is introduced by combining measurements performed on heterogeneous data samples using different methods . if real , however , the observed scatter would indicate that the models , in particular the mmc model , can not account for the variation of @xmath0 among different lines - of - sight , even though it reproduces well its _ mean _ redshift evolution . according to the results from our simulations ( cf . section [ sec : dda ] ) , it is expected that @xmath0 as predicted by the mmc model be lognormally distributed with a high confidence at redshifts @xmath247 , and consequently , that @xmath118 and hence the optical depth of hi should obey a gaussian distribution . however , this result is not supported by the observations given the poor agreement between the scatter predicted by the mmc models and the observed distribution of @xmath0 at a given redshift . on the other hand , the expectation that @xmath0 should be either lognormally or gaussian distributed is based solely on the fact that the transmission factor be written in the form of equation ( [ eq : msk ] ) , which is certainly independent of the particular model accounting for the evolution of the ly@xmath2 absorbers . a different set of input distribution functions may have an effect on the mean value and the spread of the distribution of @xmath0 at each redshift , but not the on the form of the distribution . it may be thus possible that a different ( more accurate ) set of input distribution functions of the absorber properties may help to reconcile the lack of agreement between the _ amplitude _ of the predicted and the observed scatter , but even in this case the disagreement regarding the _ form _ of the distribution when compared to previous studies ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) remains . even though the amplitude of the observed and simulated scatter do not quite match , it is interesting to note that the redshift at which the intrinsic scatter in evolution of @xmath0 peaks ( cf . figure [ fig : sca ] ) roughly coincides with the redshift at which the observations show a strong scatter ( cf . figure [ fig : daz ] ) . this redshift matches the redshift at which @xcite reported a local decrement in the evolution of the ly@xmath2 optical depth @xmath114 , recently confirmed by @xcite , which has been interpreted by @xcite as a signature of the reionisation of . note , however , that at this redshift the @xmath0 measurements lie predominantly above the mean value as given by the models ( cf . figure [ fig : daz ] ) , and hence the trend suggested by these observations is exactly the opposite from that found by @xcite , since a decrease in @xmath114 implies a decrease in @xmath0 . this strongly indicates that the difference in method and the heterogeneity of the samples of the different surveys does introduce an artificial bias in the observed evolution of @xmath0 , in particular in its scatter . we finally want to highlight the following curiosity : by taking a close look at figures [ fig : sca ] and [ fig : daz2 ] it becomes apparent that the maximum in the evolution of @xmath167 roughly coincides with the point of inflection of the curve that describes the expected redshift evolution of the mean @xmath0 . mathematically , this would imply that the intrinsic scatter of @xmath0 is proportional to the rate of change of the mean @xmath0 with redshift , _ i.e. _ @xmath248 indeed , if one computes numerically the derivative of @xmath249 with respect to @xmath8 , it turns out that it qualitatively matches the evolution of @xmath250 , up to a scale transformation . a physical interpretation may be gained in light of equation ( [ eq : pwl ] ) : a rapid evolution of the absorbers , quantified by the parameter @xmath39 , implies a stronger evolution of @xmath0 with @xmath8 . since the evolution is however different in general for different lines - of - sight , this in turn implies a larger variation in the absorption from line - of - sight to line - of - sight , and thus a larger value of @xmath250 . this is mathematically consistent with the fact that the scatter given by the derivative of equation ( [ eq : pwl ] ) with respect to @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath39 . 1 .   we measured the cosmic flux decrement @xmath0 and its uncertainty due to statistical and systematic errors for 25 qsos of the sdss dr5 catalog in the redshift range @xmath251 . we modeled the redshift evolution of the mean @xmath0 and its distribution at each given redshift in a monte carlo fashion , adopting two among the various models presented by @xcite . we found that the predictions of the mmc model for the evolution of the mean @xmath0 reproduce well the observations in the range @xmath243 , in contrast to the bmc model . we conclude from this that the underlying input distributions of the bmc model may not accurately account for the evolution of the ly@xmath2 absorption on the igm . hence , estimates of the impact of the intergalactic attenuation on the photometric properties of high - redshift galaxies using this particular model should be taken with caution . incidentally , by showing the rather good agreement between one particular set of simulations and the data , we show the power of the relatively simple approach used here to model the effect of intergalactic absorption , as compared to models based on hydrodynamical simulations which are by far more complex . 3 .   through the comparison between the mmc and bmc models , we showed that different input distribution functions may have very different predictions regarding the evolution of @xmath0 , a quantity which is intimately related and hence very sensitive to the amount of hi present along the line - of - sight . therefore , we state that any model of the intergalactic absorption should first of all reproduce the observed evolution of @xmath0 and its distribution before it is used to _ e.g. _ correct synthetic or observed spectra for intergalactic absorption . the results from our simulations suggest that the distribution of @xmath0 at a given redshift be well described by a lognormal distribution at low redshifts and by a gaussian distribution at high redshifts , in agreement with our theoretical expectation based on the fact that the absorption is mathematically expressed as the product of small , statistically independent factors . this result implies that at redshifts where @xmath0 is distributed lognormally , the effective optical depth of the intergalactic hi should obey a normal distribution , contrary to the results of previous studies . however , this result should be taken with caution in light of the fact that the models , in particular the mmc model , can not reproduce the amplitude of the observed scatter in @xmath0 . 5 . we argue that most of the observed scatter in @xmath0 is introduced by combining measurements based on different methods . nevertheless , the reason for the lack of agreement between the scatter predicted by the mmc model and the observed distribution of @xmath0 is not ultimately settled . because of this and until this discrepancy is clarified , we may warn about using any attenuation model based on the input distributions of the mmc model to estimate magnitude changes in the spectra of background sources . a larger , homogeneous sample of accurate measurements of @xmath0 over a wide redshift range is needed in order to allow for a more faithful comparison to models , and in particular , to determine the intrinsic _ form _ and _ amplitude _ of the distribution of @xmath0 as a function of redshift . we want to thank our referee m. bershady for his insightful comments and suggestions which helped improving our work . we are also grateful to avery meiksin for computing a special set of tables of his transmission functions , and to nico bissantz for useful suggestions about the statistical treatment of the data . ttg acknowledges financial support from the _ mexican council for science and technology _ ( conacyt ) , and the _ deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft _ ( dfg ) through grant dfg -

peterson ( gp ) test by @xcite , a detailed knowledge about the physical state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) has been gained from the study of the absorption features identified in the spectra of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) at restframe wavelengths @xmath4 , which are now known to be mainly due to resonant scattering by intergalactic neutral hydrogen randomly distributed along the line - of - sight , as first proposed by @xcite . for instance , the null result in the search for a gp trough has been used to rule out the existence of a hot intercloud medium ( icm ) @xcite , which was thought to confine by pressure the ly@xmath2 clouds @xcite . as a result of detailed analyses of the line statistics of the absorbing material , a wealth of information on its clustering ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) , in particular the existence of voids ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and the evolution of its number densities , column densities , and doppler parameter with redshift ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) has accumulated over the past years . these results , in combination with the use of state - of - the - art numerical simulations of structure formation based on the currently accepted paradigm of the concordance cosmology @xcite , show that the features seen in absorption against bright background sources arise when the line - of - sight intersects the structures that naturally emerge and evolve with time under the influence of gravitational attraction . different types of structures such as the filaments present in the _ cosmic web _ , galactic haloes , and even the discs of primeval galaxies , give rise to distinct absorption features attributed to entities known historically as ly@xmath2 forest clouds , lyman limit systems ( llss ) , and damped ly@xmath2 absorbers ( dlas ) ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for excellent reviews , respectively ) . nevertheless , the relation between the observed absorption features and the objects causing them , in particular the correlation between observed damped absorption lines , metal lines ( _ e.g. _ mg ii , o vi ) and galaxies  the so - called absorber - galaxy connection  is still a matter of debate ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * part 1 ) . as a consequence of numerous efforts over many years , we now have a better understanding of the origins of the different absorption features observed in qso spectra . in particular , the notion of discrete , intervening hi absorbing systems randomly distributed along the line - of - sight has been embedded into the more general picture of an evolving _ continuous _ intergalactic medium with a hi density field that varies in space and time , with its evolution driven mainly by the hubble expansion , the radiation field of ionising uv sources , and the collapse of structures due to gravity .      over decades many people have been working hard towards inferring the physical properties of the intergalactic medium such as its chemical content , density , temperature , etc . ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) by measuring the type of transition , strength , number density , and profiles of absorption lines imprinted in the spectra of qsos and , more recently , of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? . there has also been a great effort to quantify the effect of the absorption due to intergalactic neutral hydrogen on the photometric properties of background sources . as a matter of fact , several models have been developed in order to account for this so - called intergalactic attenuation , with different approaches and purposes . @xcite used monte carlo simulations to estimate the amount of absorption at wavelengths shorter than the redshifted heii @xmath5 line , in order to test the feasibility of the equivalent of the gunn - peterson test for intergalactic helium . they found that the absorption as a function of wavelength , averaged over many lines - of - sight , should display together with a characteristic stair - case profile due to the cumulative absorption at the hi resonant wavelengths , an additional characteristic valley - shaped feature ( the  lyman - valley  ) due to the cumulative effect of the photoionisation of hi by photons with energies @xmath6 , where @xmath7 . later on , in a seminal paper @xcite developed an analytical method to quantify the opacity due to intergalactic hi as a function of redshift , and its effect on the colors of high - redshift galaxies . the underlying assumption of this model is that the observed flux of a source at redshift @xmath8 is given by the product of the _ intrinsic _ flux and a transmission factor that accounts for the _ mean _ absorption as a function of wavelength given in the form @xmath9 ( see * ? ? ? * their equation 3 ) , where the brackets denote the average over an ensemble of random lines - of - sight . the most common application of this model consists in correcting the flux of a synthetic ( galaxy- , qso- ) spectrum for intergalactic absorption . this correction is of particular importance at high redshift , where intergalactic hi severely absorbs the light of a background object at restframe wavelengths shorter than @xmath10 , leading to a substantial reddening of its colour ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? as the numerous references in the literature attest , the @xcite model has become the most widely used attenuation model . however , in a later work ( * ? ? ? * from now on bcg99 ) argued that it is not possible to estimate the mean change in the magnitude of a source at a given redshift due to absorption by intergalactic hi along the line - of - sight by multiplying the mean transmission curve of @xcite s model with the spectrum of the source and integrating over the corresponding passband , mainly because of the existence of color terms . they suggested that the correct way of accounting for the mean effect of hi absorption on the spectrum of a background source and on its photometric properties is to model first the absorption along many random lines - of - sight , compute the desired photometric quantities for each one of them , and _ then _ compute the average over the ensemble of lines - of - sight . in other words , they argue that the processes of averaging over many random lines - of - sight and measuring photometric quantities are non - commutative . indeed , they showed using a monte carlo technique that the average magnitudes computed following their approach substantially differ from those computed using @xcite s model , even when using the same input distributions for the number of absorbers , their column densities and doppler parameters . the approach proposed by effectively mimics the measurement process that would take place if one would determine _ e.g. _ the mean observed brightness of a collection of galaxies with different absorber populations along their particular lines - of - sight , but otherwise identical in their intrinsic properties ( spectrum , morphology , etc . ) , and is hence physically meaningful . it turns out that features such as the characteristic stair - case profile and the lyman - valley can not possibly be observed in a _ spectrum , since they arise only by averaging over sufficient numbers of lines - of - sight , a process that has no physical meaning . in a more recent paper , @xcite developed a method to compute the opacity due to intergalactic hi by using hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation in the framework of the concordance @xmath11cdm cosmology performed by @xcite . applying their model to compute broad - band magnitudes for different types of objects ( _ e.g. _ starburst galaxies , qsos of type i and ii ) , @xcite reports differences of 0.5  1.0 mag with respect to @xcite s model . despite the different results obtained , this model is similar to @xcite s model in the sense that it implicitly assumes that the mean opacity of the igm along a random line - of - sight due to the presence of hi can be accounted for by multiplying a given input spectrum with a mean attenuation curve of the form @xmath12 and integrating over the corresponding filter function ( see * ? ? ? * their equation 8) . following , we state that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the intrinsic flux , @xmath15 is the filter transmission function , and the brackets denote the average over all lines - of - sight . we consider that the operation implied by the right - hand side of this expression is the correct way of estimating mean magnitudes of background objects including the effect of the absorption due to intergalactic hi . this approach is of course not restricted to the computation of mean magnitudes and colors , and can be applied to the estimate of the mean of any photometric quantity . furthermore , it is also possible to determine not only the mean , but in principle any desired confidence interval around the mean , _ e.g. _ @xmath16 range , via the computation of quantiles ( see section [ sec : res ] ) . it should be clear that not only the method , but also the input physics is an ( even more ) crucial ingredient of a particular model that accounts for the intergalactic attenuation , as already shown by . it is , however , not trivial to test whether using a particular method and a set of input distributions accurately describes the observed effect of the absorption by intergalactic hi on the spectra of background sources . for example , the evolutionary synthesis models of @xcite that include the correction for intergalactic absorption based on @xcite s model match quite well the observations of galaxies in the hubble deep field ( * ? ? ? * their figure 12 ) , since the magnitude differences reported by ( their figure 7 ) for one of their models with respect to @xcite s model are in this case of the order of the scatter of the observations around the predicted colors . in other words , even though @xcite s and s approaches are fundamentally different , it is difficult to test the accuracy of their predictions on the basis of a comparison to _ e.g. _ observed galaxy colors . a quantity that is more sensitive to the absorption due to intergalactic hi is the mean cosmic flux decrement @xmath0 ( cf . section [ sec : cfd ] ) . the reason for this is that the restframe wavelength range over which this quantity is measured is typically @xmath17 wide , and is hence narrower than typical broadband filters . we thus consider as a primer test that any model that accounts for the absorption due to intergalactic hi should reproduce first of all the observations of this quantity . hence , through the comparison of their respective predictions to measurements of @xmath0 it should be possible to discriminate between different models which may or may not be appropriate to account for the effect of the intergalactic attenuation on the spectra of background sources . we select for this comparison two of several models introduced by to compute the magnitude changes of high - redshift galaxies due to intergalactic absorption , and which are based , respectively , on the input distribution functions of @xcite , and the input physics of the @xcite approach . the latter is chosen since , as already mentioned , it is the model most widely used in the literature ; the former constitutes , to the best of our knowledge , the most complete set of input distribution functions for the evolution of the ly@xmath2 absorbers to date , later expanded but not significantly changed by @xcite . + to sum up : the main goal of this work is to model and analyse the redshift evolution of @xmath0 for different evolution scenarios of the intergalactic neutral hydrogen , conveniently parametrized by input distribution functions of the form of equation ( [ eq : ddf ] , section [ sec : cfd ] ) . hence , the models we consider here differ only by the set of input distribution functions used , but they all equal in method , _ i.e. _ all of them take advantage of the monte carlo technique . we judge the goodness of a particular model by its power to reproduce the observations of @xmath0 in a wide redshift range , and analyse to which extent the theoretical expectations about the properties of @xmath0 are recovered from the measurements . this work is organised as follows : in section [ sec : cfd ] we briefly recall the concept of the cosmic flux decrement and discuss some issues related to its measurement . in section [ sec : mod ] we present two different types of models for the intergalactic attenuation , which we use to model the redshift evolution of the cosmic flux decrement . in section [ sec : mda ] , we describe our measurements of this quantity for a sample of sdss qso spectra . finally , we compare these and previous measurements to the outcomes of each model , and discuss the results of this comparison as well as some other implications of the models for the evolution of @xmath0 in section [ sec : res ] . before high - resolution ( _ i.e. _ @xmath18 ) , high s / n observation became feasible , the basic spectroscopic technique used to analyse the effect of the absorption due to intergalactic neutral hydrogen on the spectra of background sources was to measure the mean depression of the observed flux relative to the unabsorbed flux or emission continuum , a quantity which became to be known as cosmic flux decrement . this quantity , first introduced by @xcite , can be defined as a function of redshift by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the continuum and the observed fluxes , respectively , and . formally , the integral is computed in the restframe wavelength range , _ i.e. _ between the ly@xmath22 and the ly@xmath2 emission lines . however , the actual estimate of @xmath0 is usually performed between the restframe wavelengths and or in an even narrower wavelength interval in order to avoid contamination by the emission wings of the ly@xmath22 + ovi and ly@xmath2 lines , respectively . since @xmath0 is extremely sensitive to @xmath20 , as can be easily seen from the definition ( [ eq : cfd ] ) , an accurate measurement of this quantity demands a reliable estimate of the underlying continuum . unfortunately , there is no consensus of what the best method to estimate the continuum may be . a popular choice , mainly because of the presence of emission lines redward of the ly@xmath2 forest region , consists in fitting a local continuum , most commonly using cubic splines ( see _ e.g. _ * ? * ) or b - spline functions ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , searching for regions apparently free of absorption blueward of the ly@xmath2 emission line . other authors prefer to fit a continuum in the region redward of the red wing of the ly@xmath2 emission line , and extrapolate it to the region blueward of it @xcite . a widely adopted form for the fitted continuum in this case is a power - law with spectral index @xmath23 which for wavelengths @xmath24 takes on values in the range ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . the latter method may tend to place the intrinsic continuum level higher than it actually is , thus overestimating the measured values of @xmath0 ( cf . [ sub : con ] ; see also * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; for the former method the opposite is true , in general ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) . for either method , there is an uncertainty in the estimate of the continuum , and this is the main drawback of the mean flux depression as a technique to estimate the mean absorption due to neutral hydrogen present in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . in an attempt to overcome this problem , @xcite used the idea that the cosmic flux decrement effectively measures the _ total _ equivalent width of all ly@xmath2 absorption lines in the chosen wavelength range if corrected for the contribution of metal absorption lines to measure this quantity by simply adding up the equivalent widths of lines identified as ly@xmath2 absorption lines . of course , the reliability of this technique highly depends on the correct identification of lines , and misidentification may lead to larger uncertainties than those associated to the continuum estimate . it turns out that reliable measurements of @xmath0 are very useful to constrain estimates of fundamental cosmological parameters such as the mean baryon density @xmath25 , the uv background intensity @xcite , the normalization of the power spectrum @xmath26 , the vacuum - energy density @xmath27 , and the hubble parameter @xmath28 @xcite . it is hence of great interest to contrast observations to theoretical models of the evolution of @xmath0 , in which the bias due to the uncertainty in the estimate of the continuum is absent . this has been previously done by different workers ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , usually obtaining a good agreement with observations . however , there is still a scatter in the observations of this quantity for which it has not been accounted yet in any modelling so far . it is possible that this scatter may well be due to the difference in the methods used by each group to measure @xmath0 and to the different redshift ranges probed . hence , by taking advantage of the monte carlo technique , we assess to which extent the _ observed _ scatter can be ascribed to the _ intrinsic _ scatter in @xmath0 due to fluctuations in the properties ( number density , column density , doppler parameter ) of the hi absorbers along different lines - of - sight ( see section [ sec : sca ] ) . from the theoretical point of view , assuming that the restframe equivalent width of the absorbers does not evolve with redshift , and that the number density of the absorbing systems evolves like @xmath29 , it is expected that @xmath0 should evolve with @xmath8 like @xmath30 where the extra factor @xmath31 comes from the scaling of the equivalent width , as pointed out by @xcite . indeed , it has been found empirically that the redshift evolution of @xmath0 can be described by a power law with @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite , even though other functional forms , _ e.g. _ an exponential of the form with @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite also match well the observations . more recently , @xcite showed that the observed evolution of @xmath0 with redshift in the range @xmath36 is well described by a broken power - law , even though the significance of the fit is low . in any case , expressions like these are only valid up to a given redshift , since they diverge for @xmath37 , whilst @xmath0 converges asymptotically to 1 in this limit or , more precisely , when z approaches the redshift @xmath38 at which reionisation sets on . as will be shown later , the redshift evolution of @xmath0 predicted by our simulations does satisfy this asymptotic behaviour ( cf . section [ sec : res ] ) . furthermore , even if the power - law form for the evolution of @xmath0 holds , the index @xmath39 in equation ( [ eq : pwl ] ) should be replaced by @xmath40 , where the latter index accounts for the averaged evolution of absorbers of different column densities , which evolve all at different rates . conversely , estimates of a single @xmath39 from @xmath0 measurements assuming a power - law of the form of equation ( [ eq : pwl ] ) , as done by @xcite , may give a hint on the population of absorbers _ dominating _ the behaviour of @xmath0 , comparing the estimated @xmath39 with the power - law index of the different populations . for instance , according to one of the models considered here , the redshift evolution of @xmath0 will be shown to be dominated by absorbers with column densities @xmath41 . + a compilation of @xmath0 measurements , accumulated in the literature over the past twenty years approximately , and which includes our own measurements that extend the redshift range to @xmath42 , is shown in figure [ fig : daz ] ( cf . section [ sec : mda ] and cited references for details on the measurements in this figure ) . since the observation of individual sources ( galaxies , qsos , grbs ) necessarily implies observations along different lines - of - sight , it is expected that the stochastic nature of the distribution of the ly@xmath2 absorbers , especially of those with the highest column densities , causes a scatter in the observed absorption , even for sources with identical intrinsic spectra . hence , depending on the absorption along a particular line - of - sight , one would expect different observed values for each measurement of any photometric quantity , for example , the cosmic flux decrement @xmath0 . performing enough measurements of such a quantity for sources with ideally identical seds at a fixed redshift , one could in principle estimate its mean and its scatter due to stochastic effects in the absorption by neutral hydrogen in the igm . the numerical realisation of this thought experiment is best achieved through monte carlo simulations . following _ @xcite , and , we generate thousands ( @xmath43 ) of lines - of - sight each with a random population of hi absorbers , and compute the absorption along each of them for a given input spectrum at a fixed redshift . the population of each line - of - sight consists of a random number @xmath44 of absorbing systems , each of them characterized by three parameters : its redshift @xmath45 , its column density @xmath46 , and its doppler parameter , where @xmath47 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath48 is the kinetic temperature of the gas and @xmath49 is the mass of the hydrogen atom . the redshift and column density characterising each absorber are drawn from a distribution of the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a normalization constant . this function defines the 1-dimensional distribution of the hi present in the igm probed by a random line - of - sight . the number @xmath52 of systems for each line - of - sight is drawn from a poisson distribution with parameter @xmath53 where the integral is carried out over appropriate redshift- and column density intervals @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . + we use different sets of input distributions that include the evolution of both low- and high density absorbers , and that give rise to the following models :    @xmath56 }   &   \\mathcal{n}_{\\,0 }   &   \\gamma   &               \\beta\\\\              \\noalign{\\smallskip }              \\hline              \\noalign{\\smallskip }              10^{\\,12 } \\ -

describe above , the attenuation factor for each absorber is given by @xmath67 $ ] , where , for the general case , the absorption coefficient @xmath68 can be written as @xmath69 the first term on the right  hand side is the opacity due to the ionisation of neutral hydrogen by photons with wavelengths @xmath70 nm . it is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the hi photoionisation cross - section , and @xmath73 is the gaunt  factor for bound  free transitions . the second term is the sum of the opacities due to resonant scattering at each transition of the lyman series transition ( from the ground state to the next higher energy level ) be identified with i = 2 , the ly@xmath22 transition with i = 3 , etc . the photoionisation cross - section is thus consistently denoted by @xmath74 . ] . in general , the absorption coefficient for the transition @xmath75 is @xmath76 the cross - section @xmath77 is a function of the doppler parameter @xmath57 , the oscillator strength of the transition @xmath78 , and the resonant wavelength @xmath79 , and is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the doppler broadening , and the variable is the distance to the line center in doppler units . we assume the profile function @xmath82 of the absorption line to be given by the voigt - hjerting function @xmath83 here , is the relative strength of the natural broadening to doppler broadening for the @xmath84th transition , and is the kinetic velocity in units of the doppler parameter . in this work , we neglect the opacity due to the photoionisation term and consider only the first resonant transition , _ i.e. _ the ly@xmath2 transition , since this is the only one of interest in the wavelength range studied here . furthermore , we use the approximation to @xmath85 for values of @xmath86 and column densities characteristic for intergalactic hi of @xcite . the cumulative absorption along a random line - of - sight of the flux @xmath88 of a source at redshift @xmath89 is calculated according to expression @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the observed and the emitted wavelengths , respectively . these are related by . the quantity @xmath87 is the transmission factor and is given by @xmath93 = \\exp\\left [ - \\sum _ { \\,i=1}^{\\,n_{\\,abs } } \\tau_{\\,2 } \\ , ( \\lambda/(1+z_{i } ) \\right]\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath94 is given by equation ( [ eq : tau3 ] ) , and @xmath95 is the redshift at the epoch of absorption , and @xmath77 and @xmath96through the dependence on the doppler parameter  in equation ( [ eq : tau3 ] ) are different in general for each absorber . however , we do not write this explicitly by _ e.g. _ introducing a new subscript in order to avoid a cumbersome notation . ] . introducing the relation @xmath97/(1+z)$ ] , it follows from equations ( [ eq : cfd ] ) , ( [ eq : fobs ] ) , and ( [ eq : msk ] ) that @xmath98 the right  hand side of this expression is just wavelength - averaged value of @xmath87 at redshift @xmath8 , and we will denote it by @xmath99 . note , however , that this quantity still depends on redshift , as indicated by the subscript . since @xmath100 and @xmath99 differ only by a constant factor , they may be considered as equivalent with respect to their statistics , which will be discussed in the next section . judging from the dependence of @xmath87 on @xmath94 and @xmath52 ( see equation [ eq : msk ] ) , it is expected that the transmission factor and consequently @xmath0 are rather complicated random variables . nevertheless , as is well known from statistics , a random variable @xmath101 that can be expressed as the product of a large number of small , statistically independent factors is distributed lognormally , _ i.e. _ according to the distribution @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the mean and the standard deviation of @xmath105 . this expression is equivalent to the statement that a random variable @xmath101 is distributed lognormally , if and only if its logarithm is distributed normally . the expected value @xmath106 and the standard deviation @xmath107 of a lognormal distributed quantity can be expressed in terms of the parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 as @xmath108 and @xmath109 from the form of equation ( [ eq : msk ] ) we may suspect that the transmission factor is a lognormally distributed variable , since it can be expressed as the product of a large number of statistically independent factors that take on values in the range @xmath110 $ ] . the implications of this statement are profound : if @xmath87 is distributed lognormally , so does @xmath99 and consequently @xmath100 . furthermore , due to the property of the lognormal distribution stated above , the effective optical depth of the ly@xmath2 absorption , usually defined as @xmath111 ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) should obey a gaussian distribution . this result follows independently from the fact that the total optical depth can be expressed as the sum of the independent contribution of each system , as indicated in equation ( [ eq : msk ] ) . thus , for a sufficiently large number of absorbers @xmath44 , and if the optical depth for each absorber has the same mean value @xmath112 and dispersion @xmath113 at each wavelength ( _ i.e. _ redshift ) , @xmath114 should obey a gaussian distribution at each redshift , centered at @xmath115 and with a dispersion @xmath116 . these statements are completely independent of the form of evolution of the intergalactic neutral hydrogen , as long as the transmission factor can be expressed in the form of equation ( [ eq : msk ] ) . in order to test whether the values of @xmath0 obey a lognormal distribution , we compute @xmath0 using the mmc and bmc models for an ensemble of @xmath117 lines - of - sight at a given redshift , and from these values we compute the mean and standard deviation of @xmath118 according to the equations @xmath119 and @xmath120 with these parameters , we generate for each redshift a set of normally distributed random numbers using a standard random - number generator , and compare them statistically to the @xmath118 values from our simulations at each given redshift , in order to determine whether the latter are normally distributed . recall that @xmath118 is distributed normally if and only if @xmath0 obeys a lognormal probability distribution . as a first approach , we choose to compare both data sets via a @xmath121-test similar method , and to this end we compute for each set of values the 50 per cent quantile ( median ) , and the @xmath122 , and @xmath123 per cent quantiles around the median . we define the following measure    @xmath124    where the @xmath125 s are the quantiles determined from the set of random numbers distributed normally , the @xmath126 s are the corresponding quantiles of the @xmath118 values at a given redshift that result from our simulations , and @xmath127 is the number of quantiles . by definition , @xmath128 explicitly gives the absolute deviation of one data set as characterised by these 11 quantiles with respect to the other data set , and thus quantifies the departure of the assumed distribution . indeed , the smaller the value of @xmath128 , the larger the probability that both data sets belong to the same parent distribution . the values of @xmath128 computed in this way turn out to lie in the range @xmath129 , which may seem vanishingly small . however , since the distribution of the random variable @xmath128 itself is unknown , we determine the significance of the results by generating two sets of normally distributed random numbers with mean and standard deviations distributed uniformly , and comparing them to the values found for our simulated data . we do this for @xmath130 pairs of sets , and determine from these what is the fraction of realisations with a value of @xmath128 smaller than a given value . according to these estimates , there is a probability of @xmath131 that a value @xmath132 will be produced by chance , respectively . in figure [ fig : del ] we show the values for @xmath128 as a function of redshift for the full mmc model , assuming a lognormal parent distribution for @xmath0 ( heavy solid line ) . the result are qualitatively the same for the bmc model and are not shown for clarity . note that for the whole redshift range shown , @xmath133 , and in particular @xmath134 for @xmath135 . it follows from the central limit theorem that the larger the number of absorbers @xmath52 , the closer the approach of the distribution of @xmath87 to a lognormal distribution , since the distribution of @xmath136 approaches a gaussian . given that @xmath52 increases with redshift , it should be expected that the accuracy with which the distribution of @xmath87 approaches a lognormal distribution also increases with redshift . furthermore , if the integral in equation ( [ eq : cfd2 ] ) is approximated by a sum of the form @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the number of pixels , it is apparent that for a sufficiently large @xmath138 , and assuming that @xmath87 has the same mean value @xmath139 and dispersion @xmath140 at each pixel , the distribution of @xmath99 should approach a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath139 and dispersion @xmath141 . since the width of a given restframe wavelength range , _ i.e. _ the number of pixels also increases with redshift as @xmath31 , it is expected that the approximation of the distribution of @xmath99 and hence of @xmath0 to a gaussian becomes better with increasing redshift . we thus have the superposition of two effects : on the one hand , the distribution of @xmath87 at a fixed wavelength approaches a lognormal distribution at any given redshift , with the accuracy increasing with redshift . on the other hand , the distribution of @xmath99 and @xmath142 approaches a gaussian distribution with increasing redshift . the net result should be that @xmath99 and @xmath0 are distributed lognormally at low redshifts , and that their distribution approaches a gaussian for higher redshifts . since @xmath0 asymptotically converges to unity for very high redshifts , its distribution at these redshifts is expected to be highly peaked around the mean value . this is naturally given by the fact that the dispersion of @xmath99 scales like @xmath141 around @xmath139 , and that @xmath138 increases with redshift , as stated above . in order to test this expectation , we compute the analytical lognormal ( gaussian ) probability distribution of @xmath0 as given by equation ( [ eq : log ] ) with the mean and standard deviation of @xmath118 ( @xmath0 ) computed using equations ( [ eq : mea ] ) and ( [ eq : std ] ) from the ensemble of values that result from our simulations at each redshift . the comparison of the analytic distribution thus obtained to the distribution of simulated @xmath0 values is shown for the full mmc model in figure [ fig : fdd ] . the results for the bmc model are qualitatively the same and are hence not shown . note the excellent agreement at all redshifts between the lognormal probability distribution and the distribution of the @xmath0 values resulting from our simulations . we want to emphasize that the curves shown are not fits to the binned data , but are computed using only the mean and standard deviation of the unbinned data . at lower redshift , the agreement at the lower cut - off , _ i.e. _ at @xmath143 is worth mentioning . it is remarkable that this cut - off , which is physically given by the fact that absorption as measured by @xmath0 can not take on values smaller than zero , arises in a natural way due solely to the fact that @xmath0 is distributed lognormally . note , in contrast , that a gaussian distribution does not satisfactorily describes the distribution of the data at these low redshifts ; in particular , the gaussian distribution does not display the sharp cut - off at @xmath143 . nevertheless , the description of the data by a gaussian distribution becomes better with increasing redshift , as expected , and also the corresponding gaussian distribution becomes narrower at every increasing redshift ( taking into account the change in the scale of the @xmath144-axis from the first to the last panel ) . moreover , note that the analytic lognormal and gaussian distribution become visually indistinguishable from each other at @xmath145 . in order to assess quantitatively the differences between these distributions with respect to the distribution of the data , we compute again the value of @xmath128 at each redshift , assuming now that the @xmath0 values obtained from the mmc model are drawn from a gaussian parent distribution . we compare these values to the corresponding values computed before for an assumed lognormal parent distribution . this comparison is shown in figure [ fig : del ] . as can be seen , the values of @xmath128 for both distributions are low at all redshifts , and the difference between them at @xmath146 is negligible small . this explains why the lognormal and gaussian distribution functions shown in figure [ fig : fdd ] are practically indistinguishable from each other . however , note that the values of @xmath128 for a assumed gaussian parent distribution become vanishingly small with increasing redshift , eventually becoming smaller than the corresponding values for the lognormal distribution . besides , it can be see also that the @xmath128 values for a assumed lognormal distribution rise again towards high redshifts , implying that the distribution of the data at these redshifts is no longer well described by a lognormal distribution.this confirms our statement made above , that @xmath0 is expected to be distributed lognormally at low redshifts and normally at higher redshifts . the redshift at which the transition from a lognormal to a gaussian distribution takes place may depend on the particular set of input distributions used . for redshifts where the distribution of @xmath0 is well approximated by a lognormal distribution , the optical depth should be distributed normally . this result is however not in agreement with the results from _ * his figure 1 ) , ( * ? ? ? * their figure b1 ) , or ( * ? ? ? * their appendix c ) , where the distribution of the mean flux , _ i.e. _ the averaged transmission factor @xmath99 is claimed to be highly inconsistent with a gaussian distribution . it is usually assumed that the presence of the high - density lyman limit systems is responsible for this behaviour , and we next make use of our simulations to address this question .      in order to quantify the effect that the llss have on the distribution of @xmath0 , we compare , following the analysis of section [ sec : dda ] , the results of the simulations for the mmc model with and without the optically thick llss . we find that @xmath0 is lognormally distributed as well with a high confidence for the case where the llss are excluded , as can in figure [ fig : del ] , where the values for @xmath128 computed at each given redshift are shown . again , the results for the bmc model are qualitatively the same and are omitted here . note that the values of @xmath128 for the mmc model without llss are larger at redshifts @xmath147 than those for the full mmc model . this is due to the fact that the absence of the optically thick llss enhances the probability of the attenuation factor @xmath148 to be closer to unity at a given wavelength along a random line - of - sight . this means effectively that the number of factors in equation ( [ eq : msk ] ) are reduced . hence , when the llss are absent , the approach to a lognormal distribution should be worse with respect to the case where the llss are included . furthermore , this effect should be enhanced towards lower redshifts , for which the number of factors , _ i.e. _ of absorbers decreases as @xmath149 . note that the trend is the opposite in the case of a assumed gaussian parent distribution . we hence find when computing the evolution of @xmath0 with the mmc model with and without llss that the predictions for the evolution of @xmath0 with redshift for the full mmc model are practically indistinguishable from the results of the mmc model without llss , which implies that the effect of these systems on the total absorption is small . furthermore , it turns out that the distribution of @xmath0 is lognormal irrespective of the presence of llss . all these results point to the fact that the lls have a negligible impact on the evolution of @xmath0 , as long as the input distributions used here correctly describe the number density evolution of the absorbers . this would confirm similar results already found by @xcite . also , as pointed out by @xcite , the picture would not be fundamentally different if higher column density systems such as damped ly@xmath2 systems were present . we will come back to this point in section [ sec : res ] . + we think that , as long as the distribution functions realistically describe the evolution of the ly@xmath2 absorbers , the llss _ can not _ truly have a great impact neither on the absorption as measured by @xmath0 , nor on its statistics because of the following reasons : 1 ) they are scarce , and even more compared to the thinner ly@xmath2 forest systems ( _ e.g. _ of the order of 5 llss on average along a random line - of - sight compared to approximately @xmath150 ly@xmath2 forest absorbers out to @xmath151 , according to the mmc model ) ; 2 ) their contribution to the absorption is due solely to the absorption at the resonant wavelength of the ly@xmath2 line , and the equivalent width of the ly@xmath2 absorption line arising in systems with column densities @xmath152 is not too different from that of the systems with column densities @xmath153 ( cf . the curve - of - growth in figure [ fig : cog ] ) , which are by far more numerous . in order to estimate the relative contribution of each population at a given redshift , we weight the equivalent width @xmath154 of the ly@xmath2 absorption line as a function of the column density @xmath138 and doppler parameter @xmath57 with the column density distribution , and compute the ratio @xmath155 where @xmath156 here , @xmath157 is the distribution function of population , @xmath158 is the rest equivalent width of a ly@xmath2 absorption line for a column density @xmath138 and doppler parameter @xmath57 , and @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the column density limits that define each population , respectively . for a reasonable value for the doppler parameter of @xmath161 , and the input distributions of the mmc model , we find that @xmath162 at all redshifts . the result is qualitatively the same for the bmc model . hence , it follows from these models that the ly@xmath2 forest systems dominate the absorption over the optically thicker lyman limit systems at all epochs . this would explain at least in part why the difference between the predictions for @xmath0 from the mmc model with and without llss , is small . also , it is consistent with the theoretical expectation that the distribution of @xmath0 should not be far from lognormal or gaussian , with or without llss , since this only depends on the fact that the absorption factor be expressed in the form of equation ( [ eq : msk ] ) , and this is truly independent of the form of the input distributions , as stated previously . we expect the intrinsic scatter in the absorption due to cosmic variance to be strongest at lines - of - sight of middle length . at low redshifts , both the number of thin ly@xmath2 forest clouds and thick lyman limit systems is small , and the addition of a few more does not change dramatically the amount of absorption . however , the mean number of ly@xmath2 forest clouds and lls increases with @xmath8 , and thus the probability of encountering more or less systems than average increases as well . correspondingly , the absorption increases and so does its scatter . at even higher redshifts , the number of ly@xmath2 forest systems increases so dramatically and the absorption is so severe that the addition of more systems does not make any difference neither to the absorption nor to the scatter . thus , we should expect the stochastic effect , _ i.e. _ the scatter in absorption , to peak at some intermediate redshift @xmath163 . we compute the intrinsic scatter at the @xmath104 level for the values of @xmath0 at each given redshift obtained from our simulations using equations ( [ eq : mul ] ) , ( [ eq : sdl ] ) , ( [ eq : mea ] ) , and ( [ eq : std ] ) . the result is shown in figure [ fig : sca ] , where we show the evolution of the scatter in @xmath0 with redshift for the mmc model with and without llss . we also include for comparison the result from the bmc model . it can be seen that , irrespective of the model , the scatter peaks at a intermediate redshift between @xmath164 and @xmath165 . note that the peak is significant , since it represents an increase in the scatter of 2.5 times with respect to its value at @xmath166 . it is interesting that this result had also been found by ( * ? ? ? * their figure 2 ) , who using a semi - analytic approach and different input distributions , reported that @xmath167 is largest at redshifts near 3.7 . thus , the qualitative behaviour of the intrinsic scatter of @xmath0 shown in figure [ fig : sca ] may be an unavoidable feature of this observable , which could explain at least in part the large scatter in the measurements of @xmath0 seen in the same redshift interval ( cf . figure [ fig : daz ] ) . as will be shown in section [ sec : res ] , however , there is a disagreement at the @xmath168 level between the _ amplitude _ of the scatter in the observations at these redshifts and that predicted by the models . when comparing models that only differ by the presence of the optically thick lyman limit systems , we find that the scatter in @xmath0 is larger at any given redshift when the lls are present , as expected . none the less , the absolute value of the scatter does not differ significantly between the situation where these systems are present and where they are absent . thus , the net effect of the llss is to enlarge the intrinsic scatter in the absorption , contributing only marginally to the mean value of the absorption itself . however , note that for redshifts @xmath169 , the amount of scatter at the 1@xmath104 level becomes indistinguishable between both scenarios , owing to the fact that the thinner ly@xmath2 forest systems are overwhelmingly more numerous at these redshifts .    the results stated above are consistent with the previous conclusion obtained from our simulations that the optically thick llss can not have a great impact on the absorption as measured by @xmath0 and on its scatter . we want to compare the predictions for the evolution of @xmath0 that result from the models described above to observations . for this purpose , we use previous measurements of @xmath0 reported in the literature , and we perform ourselves new measurements of this quantity , using qso spectra from the sdss data release 5 @xcite , thus extending the redshift range of the measurements to @xmath42 . our selection procedure of sources suitable for this purpose was as follows : since the wavelength range available from sdss ( dr5 ) is @xmath170 { \\ , \\mathrm{nm}}$ ] , and we measure the continuum depression @xmath0 in the restframe wavelength interval @xmath171 { \\ , \\mathrm{nm}}$ ] , the redshift of our sample is restricted to @xmath172 . we choose @xmath173 as our lowest redshift in order to avoid the low s / n at the blue end of the spectrograph . a simple query for high - z quasi - stellar objects on the sdss skyserver spectroscopic query form with this restriction alone returns around 2400 spectra . from this first selection , we rejected those objects for which the redshift was either not measured , the measurement had failed , or the measured photometric and spectroscopic redshifts were inconsistent with each other . we binned the quasars in redshift intervals of @xmath174 and selected for each redshift bin the spectrum with the highest s / n , leaving us with 28 sources , from which we removed three further objects due to low data quality . the resulting sample is listed in table [ tab : qso ] . the continuum of a quasar is often assumed to be of the form ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , or equivalently , , where both indices are related by , and , and @xmath175 is the speed of light . empirical evidence in favour of the assumption of an underlying continuum in form of a power - law has been given by _ @xcite , who derived an average power - law index of @xmath176 for and @xmath177 for . this is consistent with the result already found by @xcite that the spectral index @xmath178 varies over large wavelength ranges . @xcite found by constructing a composite qso spectrum from 284 hst fos spectra that a single power - law describes well the continuum for wavelengths between 105 and 220 nm with @xmath179 , but that the continuum steepens ( flattens in @xmath180 ) significantly for @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) . similarly , @xcite reported , using a sample nearly twice as large as the @xcite s sample , that the continuum in the extreme uv region between @xmath183 and @xmath184 and in the near uv between @xmath185 and @xmath186 is well described by a single power - law with @xmath187 and @xmath188 , respectively . furthermore , by constructing a composite qso spectrum from a homogeneous sample of over 2200 sdss qsos , @xcite concluded that the continuum in the rest - frame wavelength range @xmath189 can be very well modeled by a single power - law either in wavelength or frequency , with @xmath190 . however , they did not estimate a spectral index for wavelengths @xmath191 . while it is the consensus that the optical / nir continuum of quasar spectra is due to synchrotron emission @xcite , the physical origin of the quasar uv / optical continuum is not yet established . on the hand hand , the observed soft x - ray / uv / optical spectral shape of quasars is found to be consistent with free - free emission of optically thin gas at temperatures @xmath192 k @xcite , which is well described by a power - law . on the other hand , it has been argued that the emission from a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk also reproduces well the observed quasar sed in this spectral region @xcite . either model , however , is consistent with an underlying continuum in the form of a power - law . alternatively , as already mentioned in section [ sec : cfd ] , other authors prefer to fit quasar continua locally using spline functions ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) searching for regions apparently free of absorption blueward of the ly@xmath2 emission line . since the ly@xmath2 forest region is severely absorbed due to intervening hi systems , especially for high - z qsos , and a local fit to the continuum in this region is difficult , with the uncertainty increasing with redshift ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) , we choose to estimate the continuum of our selected sources in the ly@xmath2 forest region by fitting a power - law to the qso spectrum redward of the ly@xmath2 emission line and extrapolating it for @xmath193 . as long as the assumption of the underlying power - law holds , this approach has the advantage that the continuum estimate is completely independent of the spectral resolution and s / n in the ly@xmath2 forest region . nevertheless , this method may lead to an systematic overestimate of the continuum flux and thus to an corresponding overestimate of @xmath0 . it follows from the results quoted above that the quasar s intrinsic continuum in spectral regions below and above the ly@xmath2 emission line may both be well described by power - laws , but with potentially different spectral indices . more specifically , the spectrum in the region below 121.6 nm ( rest - frame ) may be steeper in frequency , and hence flatter in wavelength , which implies @xmath194 . ] , with respect to the continuum in the region above 121.6 nm ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * their figure 4 ) . thus , fitting a continuum in the form of a power - law at wavelengths @xmath24 and extrapolating it towards @xmath191 may well lead to an overestimate of the continuum level in that region , as first pointed out by @xcite , according to whom the @xmath0 may be overestimated by at least 0.05 at @xmath195 . we will take this systematic bias into account when estimating the uncertainty in our @xmath0 measurements ( cf . section [ sub : dam ] ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : qso ]    the designation of each object meets the iau nomenclature , as required . for details on the official sdss designation of an object , please consult www.sdss.org/dr5/coverage/iau.html    the power - law that we fit to each spectrum is of the form @xmath196 where the flux amplitude @xmath197 , the wavelength off - set @xmath198 , and the spectral index @xmath178 are the parameters to be determined . we fit the continuum in the wavelength range , in order to avoid the red emission wing of the ly@xmath2 line and the red end of the spectrograph , respectively . note that the available wavelength range decreases with redshift , and this may introduce an increasing uncertainty in the fitted continuum . the fit parameters and their uncertainties were obtained with help of the idl task curvefit . it turns out that the continuum fit is rather insensitive to the uncertainties in the flux amplitude and the wavelength off - set , and extremely sensitive to the uncertainty in the spectral index . because of this and for simplicity , in our further analysis we neglect the error in the first two parameters and consider only the uncertainty in the spectral index to be of relevance . an example of a qso spectrum and its corresponding fit are shown in figure [ fig : qso ] . the spectral index and its uncertainty for each source are listed in table [ tab : qso ] ( columns three and four , respectively ) . the uncertainty in the spectral index quoted in column four and denoted by @xmath199 includes the formal error inherent to the fitting process , which is due to the error in the detected flux , the removal of broad emission lines in the region @xmath200  which makes the wavelength range become patchy  , and the systematic uncertainty due to the decreasing available wavelength range with redshift mentioned above . the systematic effect of the latter in particular can clearly be seen on the overall trend for the uncertainty in the spectral index to increase with redshift .      for each qso spectrum , we compute the _ total _ absorption pixel by pixel in the restframe range @xmath201 { \\ , \\mathrm{nm}}$ ] according to the expression ) . ] @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the total number of pixels between and . the lower limit of this range is chosen as to avoid the wings of the ly@xmath22 + ovi emission lines , while the upper limits is such that the blue wing of the ly@xmath2 emission line is excluded in the computation of @xmath0 . the measurement of @xmath0 for each source together with its corresponding uncertainty are listed in table [ tab : qso ] ( column five ) . there are two independent sources of uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath0 : 1 ) the error in the spectral index inherent to the continuum fitting , _ i.e. _ @xmath204 , and 2 ) the possibility that the continuum level may have been systematically overestimated due to the change in slope of the power - law at @xmath205 ( cf . section [ sub : con ] ) . we shall refer to the uncertainty in @xmath0 due to the first and second sources @xmath206 and @xmath207 , respectively . the total uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath0 quoted in column five of table [ tab : qso] is then assumed to be given by @xmath208 . as a consistency check , we adopt two different methods to estimate @xmath209 . the first method assumes that the @xmath210 range for each measurement is given by , respectively , for the corresponding values of @xmath211 listed in table [ tab : qso ] . the second method is based on error propagation , according to which the error @xmath212 in the estimate of a quantity @xmath213 , which depends on @xmath214 independent random variables @xmath215 , each with an uncertainty @xmath216 , is given by @xmath217 in the case of our measurements of @xmath0 , only the uncertainty in the index @xmath178 is relevant , and hence equation ( [ eq : err ] ) becomes , with the appropriate notation , @xmath218 where we have used equations ( [ eq : pow ] ) and ( [ eq : daz ] ) . note that we do not include the term due to the error in the detected flux @xmath21 , since this is already included in @xmath219 . the error computed according to the first method is asymmetric , as expected , while the error computed using equation ( [ eq : err2 ] ) approximately ( in some cases exactly ) corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the former . since the error estimates computed according to both these methods are consistent with each other , we may use either to estimate the uncertainty in @xmath0 due to the uncertainty in the continuum fit ; we choose to use the values computed according to method 1 , which are listed in table [ tab : qso ] ( column six ) . it is not clear based on the results found in the literature ( cf . section [ sub : con ] ) whether the continuum blueward of ly@xmath2 may _ always _ be overestimated when assuming it to be described by an extrapolation of the power - law redward of ly@xmath2 . however , we will assume that this is the case in order to allow for the possibility that our @xmath0 measurements may have been systematically overestimated . in order to compute the corresponding uncertainty in @xmath0 , we make the following assumptions : first , the continuum in the region blueward of ly@xmath2 shall be described by a power - law as well , but with a smaller spectral index  _ i.e. _ the continuum is _ flatter _  with respect to the region redward of ly@xmath2 . since it is not possible to fit a power - law in this regime for the data we use , we assume that both power - laws ( above and below ly@xmath2 ) are normalised at @xmath205 . furthermore , and for simplicity , we take the difference in the spectral indices below and above ly@xmath2 to be equal 1 ( which corresponds roughly to the findings in the literature quoted in section [ sub : con ] ) . under these assumptions , the value of @xmath0 for our sample turns out to be overestimated on average by less than ten per cent . this value is slightly lower for our measurement of @xmath0 at @xmath220 than the correction estimated by @xcite . however , they also remark that the exact value of the bias depends on the particular method applied to extrapolate the continuum in the ly@xmath2 forest region . we hence make the rather conservative assumption that each measurement of @xmath0 has an additional uncertainty @xmath221 of ten per cent , and add this uncertainty only to the _ low _ error bound , since we are assuming that the continuum , and hence @xmath0 , may have been _ _ over__estimated . we could in principle correct our @xmath0 estimates by shifting all measurements by ten per cent towards a lower value , but since it is not clear whether the continuum has been overestimated for _ every single _ measurement , we prefer to express this bias as an uncertainty . the uncertainty @xmath222 for each measurement is listed in the last column of table [ tab : qso ] . note that we do not correct our measurements for contamination of metal lines . however , this should not introduce a large error , since their contribution is small . for example , @xcite find that they contribute by @xmath223 per cent to the total absorption at @xmath224 . the validity of this assumption will be tested in the next section by the comparison of @xmath0-measurements to the results of our simulations , in which the absorption due to metal lines is not included . we compute the evolution of @xmath0 in the redshift interval @xmath225 using the models mmc ( with and without lyman limit systems ) and bmc presented in the section [ sec : mod ] , which include the effect of different populations of absorbers , _ i.e. _ ly@xmath2 forest clouds and lyman limit absorbers . for comparison , we include also the values of @xmath0 computed using @xcite s model ( see section [ sec : rev ] ) . we refer to this model as mtc . for the mmc ( with and without lls ) and bmc models , we simulate an ensemble of @xmath117 lines - of - sight at fixed redshift , and compute for each of them the flux decrement @xmath0 according to equation ( [ eq : daz ] ) . in this way we get for each given redshift an ensemble of an equal number of @xmath0 values for each model , from which we estimate the 50 per cent quantile ( median ) , and the @xmath122 , and @xmath123 per cent quantiles around the median , which correspond to the @xmath226 and @xmath227 ranges . we do not compute the mean and @xmath104 ranges in the standard way , since the distribution of @xmath0 is strictly speaking unknown a priori . however , according to the results from section [ sec : mod ] , the distribution of @xmath0 is not too far from a lognormal or even a gaussian distribution ; hence , the identification of mean with median , of @xmath16 range with the @xmath228 quantile around the median , and so on , is justified . since the mtc model only provides a ( mean ) transmission function at each redshift , we compute for this model one single value for @xmath0 at each redshift by numerically integrating the corresponding transmission function in the restframe wavelength range @xmath229 { \\ , \\mathrm{nm}}$ ] . we compare our simulations to measurements of @xmath0 accumulated in the literature over the past two decades , performed with different methods and approaches . this compilation is by no means intended to be complete . the reason for choosing these measurements is mainly that they were performed in more or less mutually exclusive redshift ranges which all together cover the range @xmath230 . our measurements extend this redshift range out to @xmath42 . therefore , these previous measurements together with our own allow a comparison to the models presented here over a wide redshift range , but with the caveat that using measurements from different groups may introduce an artificial bias in the evolution of @xmath0 due to the differences in the particular method used and the different redshift ranges probed in each case , as previously mentioned . the literature data and our measurements are shown together with our model calculations in figure [ fig : daz ] ( see cited references for details on the corresponding measurements ) . as can be seen in this figure , the predictions for the evolution of the mean @xmath0 from all three models , mmc , bmc , and mtc , are practically indistinguishable from each other when compared to observations for redshifts @xmath147 . we do not include in this figure the predictions for @xmath0 based on the mmc model without llss , since the difference between this and the full mmc model is negligible . at higher redshifts , the values of @xmath0 obtained from the mmc and mtc models match the observations quite well . note that in spite of the fundamentally different approaches and input physics of these models , their results are very similar . as a result , it is not possible yet to discriminate between these models due to the uncertainty and the strong scatter in the observations , especially around @xmath164 ( cf . section [ sec : sca ] ) . in contrast to the mmc and the mtc models , the predictions from the bmc model strongly deviate from the measurements of @xmath0 at @xmath231 , _ underestimating _ the absorption . since the mmc and bmc models differ only in terms of the input distributions and not in terms of the method , this result suggests that the evolution of the ly@xmath2 absorbers implied by the input distributions of the bmc model is slower than expected from the evolution of @xmath0 ( cf . equation [ eq : pwl ] ) . if used to compute the magnitude changes for high - redshift galaxies due to intergalactic absorption as done by _ e.g. _ , the difference in the predicted evolution of @xmath0 between the mmc and bmc models corresponds to a difference of slightly more than 0.6 mag in the predicted magnitude change for _ e.g. _ an sd - type galaxy with a constant star formation rate at @xmath232 in the f450w filter . the corresponding difference between the mmc and mtc model amounts to less than 0.3 mag . it is worth mentioning at this point that , in contrast to previous models ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) , we explicitly avoid normalising in any way the used distributions to match the observed @xmath0 at some given redshift , or manipulating the models whatsoever to satisfy any other restriction . we simply take the distributions as reported in the literature , where they were determined directly by means of line statistics by the authors and references therein . we mention this in order to emphasize the rather good agreement between the observations and the evolution of the mean @xmath0 predicted by all three models at @xmath233 , and by the mmc model at higher redshifts , further reinforced by the similarity between the results of the mtc and the mmc models , which are completely independent from each other . we include in figure [ fig : daz ] the empirical fits of @xcite of the form @xmath234 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 and of @xcite of the form @xmath235 with @xmath236 and @xmath237 . these empirical fits match the observations quite well at @xmath238 , and may be useful as a rough estimate of the mean absorption at those redshifts . however , as stated before , they should be taken with caution , especially at high redshifts . while @xmath0 asymptotically converges to unity as the redshift approaches the epoch of reionisation , @xmath239 , these empirical fits diverge . in contrast , the predicted evolution of @xmath0 from all models described above does satisfy the expected and observed asymptotic behaviour . the rate of convergence to this limiting value certainly depends on the particular set of input distributions used , as shown by the comparison between the mmc to the bmc model . in general , the stronger the number density evolution , the faster the convergence . in other words , different input distribution functions imply different values for @xmath38 , and this information may be used as a further constraint on the accuracy of a particular set of input distributions . extending the computations of the evolution of @xmath0 with the mmc model to redshifts @xmath240 , it turns out that @xmath0 is almost unity at @xmath241 . this value is slightly higher than the value of 6.5 quoted by @xcite for the epoch of reionisation . the compilation of @xmath0 measurements shown in figure [ fig : daz ] displays a large scatter at all redshifts , in particular at redshifts @xmath231 . previously , concerns were raised about the possibility that the amplitude of the intrinsic scatter due to cosmic variance may be enhanced by combining measurements performed with different methods and using heterogeneous data samples . hence , we select a subset from our compilation following the criteria stated below , and compare this observations to the scatter as predicted by our simulations . the results of this comparison are summarised in figure [ fig : daz2 ] . here , we show the redshift evolution of @xmath0 as computed from the mmc model . we include the 50 per cent quantile , _ i.e. _ the median , and the @xmath228 , and @xmath123 per cent quantiles , which correspond to the @xmath242- , and @xmath227 ranges around the median at each redshift . again , the difference between the predictions of the mmc with and without llss is negligible , and thus we show only the results for the full mmc model . we do not include the bmc model in this analysis in view of the disagreement with the observations at redshifts @xmath231 . our new data subset consists of our own measurements together with the measurements of @xcite , who use power - law fits to estimate the continuum level of the quasars , and of the measurements from @xcite , who fit the continuum locally using b - splines . we select these measurements for the following reasons : @xcite s data allow a more direct comparison to our data due to the similarity in method to estimate @xmath0 ; @xcite s data are the most recent and accurate measurements of @xmath0 available to date . furthermore , these data sets individually cover the largest redshift ranges , and together they constitute the smallest set of individual measurements fully spanning the redshift range @xmath243 with some overlap . within the quoted uncertainty , the observations are well matched by the evolution of @xmath0 as predicted by the mmc model in the redshift range @xmath244 , with the exception of some outliers around @xmath245 , where the scatter of our observations alone as well as the scatter in the full sample of measurements is large , as can be seen in figure [ fig : daz ] . it is apparent from figure [ fig : daz2 ] that the largest scatter in the observed values of @xmath0 at a given redshift can not be ascribed to the _ intrinsic _ scatter in the absorption due to variations from one line - of - sight to another as computed with the mmc model , not even at the @xmath246 level . nevertheless , note that this is only the case for @xcite s and our measurements , while @xcite s measurements are all nicely contained within the @xmath227 envelope of the model . this suggests that the observed scatter or at least part of it is not real , but only an artifact introduced by combining observations based on different methods to measure @xmath0 . this assumption is supported by the small amplitude of the scatter in the distribution of high - redshift galaxy colors already found by ( cf . their figure 6 ) for a variety of input distribution functions . also , the fact that @xcite s measurements are well matched by the mmc model points to the fact that the particular method chosen by @xcite and ourselves to estimate the continuum in the ly@xmath2 forest region does introduce a bias in the measurements of @xmath0 . on the one hand , there is very likely a bias do to the already discussed systematic overestimate of the continuum level . furthermore , neither @xcite nor we corrected our corresponding measurements for metal - line absorption . these facts together would explain in part why precisely our and their measurements are higher on average than the median value of @xmath0 predicted by the mmc model , as can be seen in figure [ fig : daz2 ] . even though its effect is expected to be small , including the absorption of metal lines should eventually increase the agreement between the results from the models and the observations . there is thus rather strong evidence that most of the amplitude in the observed scatter in @xmath0 displayed in figures [ fig : daz ] and [ fig : daz2 ] is introduced by combining measurements performed on heterogeneous data samples using different methods . if real , however , the observed scatter would indicate that the models , in particular the mmc model , can not account for the variation of @xmath0 among different lines - of - sight , even though it reproduces well its _ mean _ redshift evolution . according to the results from our simulations ( cf . section [ sec : dda ] ) , it is expected that @xmath0 as predicted by the mmc model be lognormally distributed with a high confidence at redshifts @xmath247 , and consequently , that @xmath118 and hence the optical depth of hi should obey a gaussian distribution . however , this result is not supported by the observations given the poor agreement between the scatter predicted by the mmc models and the observed distribution of @xmath0 at a given redshift . on the other hand , the expectation that @xmath0 should be either lognormally or gaussian distributed is based solely on the fact that the transmission factor be written in the form of equation ( [ eq : msk ] ) , which is certainly independent of the particular model accounting for the evolution of the ly@xmath2 absorbers . a different set of input distribution functions may have an effect on the mean value and the spread of the distribution of @xmath0 at each redshift , but not the on the form of the distribution . it may be thus possible that a different ( more accurate ) set of input distribution functions of the absorber properties may help to reconcile the lack of agreement between the _ amplitude _ of the predicted and the observed scatter , but even in this case the disagreement regarding the _ form _ of the distribution when compared to previous studies ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) remains . even though the amplitude of the observed and simulated scatter do not quite match , it is interesting to note that the redshift at which the intrinsic scatter in evolution of @xmath0 peaks ( cf . figure [ fig : sca ] ) roughly coincides with the redshift at which the observations show a strong scatter ( cf . figure [ fig : daz ] ) . this redshift matches the redshift at which @xcite reported a local decrement in the evolution of the ly@xmath2 optical depth @xmath114 , recently confirmed by @xcite , which has been interpreted by @xcite as a signature of the reionisation of . note , however , that at this redshift the @xmath0 measurements lie predominantly above the mean value as given by the models ( cf . figure [ fig : daz ] ) , and hence the trend suggested by these observations is exactly the opposite from that found by @xcite , since a decrease in @xmath114 implies a decrease in @xmath0 . this strongly indicates that the difference in method and the heterogeneity of the samples of the different surveys does introduce an artificial bias in the observed evolution of @xmath0 , in particular in its scatter . we finally want to highlight the following curiosity : by taking a close look at figures [ fig : sca ] and [ fig : daz2 ] it becomes apparent that the maximum in the evolution of @xmath167 roughly coincides with the point of inflection of the curve that describes the expected redshift evolution of the mean @xmath0 . mathematically , this would imply that the intrinsic scatter of @xmath0 is proportional to the rate of change of the mean @xmath0 with redshift , _ i.e. _ @xmath248 indeed , if one computes numerically the derivative of @xmath249 with respect to @xmath8 , it turns out that it qualitatively matches the evolution of @xmath250 , up to a scale transformation . a physical interpretation may be gained in light of equation ( [ eq : pwl ] ) : a rapid evolution of the absorbers , quantified by the parameter @xmath39 , implies a stronger evolution of @xmath0 with @xmath8 . since the evolution is however different in general for different lines - of - sight , this in turn implies a larger variation in the absorption from line - of - sight to line - of - sight , and thus a larger value of @xmath250 . this is mathematically consistent with the fact that the scatter given by the derivative of equation ( [ eq : pwl ] ) with respect to @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath39 . 1 .   we measured the cosmic flux decrement @xmath0 and its uncertainty due to statistical and systematic errors for 25 qsos of the sdss dr5 catalog in the redshift range @xmath251 . we modeled the redshift evolution of the mean @xmath0 and its distribution at each given redshift in a monte carlo fashion , adopting two among the various models presented by @xcite . we found that the predictions of the mmc model for the evolution of the mean @xmath0 reproduce well the observations in the range @xmath243 , in contrast to the bmc model . we conclude from this that the underlying input distributions of the bmc model may not accurately account for the evolution of the ly@xmath2 absorption on the igm . hence , estimates of the impact of the intergalactic attenuation on the photometric properties of high - redshift galaxies using this particular model should be taken with caution . incidentally , by showing the rather good agreement between one particular set of simulations and the data , we show the power of the relatively simple approach used here to model the effect of intergalactic absorption , as compared to models based on hydrodynamical simulations which are by far more complex . 3 .   through the comparison between the mmc and bmc models , we showed that different input distribution functions may have very different predictions regarding the evolution of @xmath0 , a quantity which is intimately related and hence very sensitive to the amount of hi present along the line - of - sight . therefore , we state that any model of the intergalactic absorption should first of all reproduce the observed evolution of @xmath0 and its distribution before it is used to _ e.g. _ correct synthetic or observed spectra for intergalactic absorption . the results from our simulations suggest that the distribution of @xmath0 at a given redshift be well described by a lognormal distribution at low redshifts and by a gaussian distribution at high redshifts , in agreement with our theoretical expectation based on the fact that the absorption is mathematically expressed as the product of small , statistically independent factors . this result implies that at redshifts where @xmath0 is distributed lognormally , the effective optical depth of the intergalactic hi should obey a normal distribution , contrary to the results of previous studies . however , this result should be taken with caution in light of the fact that the models , in particular the mmc model , can not reproduce the amplitude of the observed scatter in @xmath0 . 5 . we argue that most of the observed scatter in @xmath0 is introduced by combining measurements based on different methods . nevertheless , the reason for the lack of agreement between the scatter predicted by the mmc model and the observed distribution of @xmath0 is not ultimately settled . because of this and until this discrepancy is clarified , we may warn about using any attenuation model based on the input distributions of the mmc model to estimate magnitude changes in the spectra of background sources . a larger , homogeneous sample of accurate measurements of @xmath0 over a wide redshift range is needed in order to allow for a more faithful comparison to models , and in particular , to determine the intrinsic _ form _ and _ amplitude _ of the distribution of @xmath0 as a function of redshift . we want to thank our referee m. bershady for his insightful comments and suggestions which helped improving our work . we are also grateful to avery meiksin for computing a special set of tables of his transmission functions , and to nico bissantz for useful suggestions about the statistical treatment of the data . ttg acknowledges financial support from the _ mexican council for science and technology _ ( conacyt ) , and the _ deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft _ ( dfg ) through grant dfg -
